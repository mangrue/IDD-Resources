Posts share unproven abortion treatments after Roe v. Wade reversal,"A list of herbs that are said to induce miscarriages is circulating on social media following the US Supreme Court decision to end the right to abortion nationwide. Some of the substances promoted online have been linked to pregnancy loss, but abortion providers say they can be ineffective and medical experts warn they could be dangerous to consume. The decision drew unusual criticism from some of America's closest allies, including France, UK and Canada. ""Just as a heads up, if you are in early stages of pregnancy definitely DO NOT ingest the following as they can potentially induce a miscarriage especially in their tea forms,"" says text in a June 24, 2022 post on Facebook.While the post and others call for people not to ingest those substances, the captions and timing suggested they are aimed at promoting alternative abortion treatments.The post includes a list of several substances, including mugwort, yarrow, Queen Anne's lace, black and blue cohosh, peppermint, chamomile, raspberry leaf, cinnamon, oregano, anise, celery seeds, pennyroyal, angelica and wormwood.""There's actually a lot more and other animal species even do this on purpose,"" the June 24 Facebook post's caption says.Screenshot of a Facebook post taken July 1, 2022Similar posts have accumulated thousands of interactions on Instagram and Twitter, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. Rolling Stone reported that videos touting herbal abortion remedies have also racked up hundreds of thousands of views on TikTok.The posts come in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that made abortion a right nationwide. Several states immediately banned the procedure following the ruling.While some of the substances circulating on social media have been linked to miscarriage when consumed in high doses, none of them have proven to be safe and effective abortion treatments. Abortion providers, herbalists and medical experts have all debunked the posts.""There are no safe, effective methods of inducing abortion with botanicals,"" said Jen Gunter, an obstetrician-gynecologist and writer, in a June 29, 2022 Substack newsletter. ""If there were, I'd be the first to tell you.""Gunter continued: ""Many herbal abortifacients are quite literally poisons, so abortion may be a by-product of the poisoning.""Take for example pennyroyal, a plant that several social media posts tout as a potential abortion treatment.The National Library of Medicine (NLM), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), says on its website that pennyroyal is ""likely unsafe"" when taken by mouth or applied to the skin -- including while pregnant. Among the possible side effects are kidney and liver disease.""Despite serious safety concerns, pennyroyal is used for the common cold, pneumonia, fatigue, ending a pregnancy (abortion), and as an insect repellant, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses,"" according to the NLM.In a June 28, 2022 Twitter thread, Josh Trebach, an Iowa-based medical toxicologist, warned against using pennyroyal to induce an abortion.""Please do not take pennyroyal as an herbal abortion,"" he said. ""This is incredibly dangerous -- it can cause liver failure, seizures, and death.""Other substances promoted in the posts, such as blue cohosh and mugwort, also have toxic effects. Some, such as chamomile and peppermint, are safe in small doses -- but herbalists and abortion providers say there is little evidence they are effective at inducing abortion.""I have never in my 35 years of work recommended an herbal abortion. One -- because they're not reliable,"" said Aviva Romm, author of ""Botanical Medicine for Women's Health"" and former president of the American Herbalists Guild. ""Could they possibly work? Possibly yes. But more often they don't work effectively, and the risk is, to get to high enough doses that you would need to even theoretically be effective, you're pushing to quite toxic doses.""Romm said scientists have ""no data on the actual effectiveness of these herbs"" and that there is ""actually very little research on any of them."" Instead, she said those seeking an abortion should consider medication or surgery.Megan N. Freeland, director of health communications at Planned Parenthood Federation of America -- the leading abortion provider in the US -- agreed. The ""most effective, well-studied regimen for medication abortion in the US is mifepristone and misoprostol,"" she said.""To be clear, the spectrum of approaches people have used to try to induce an abortion ranges from the less effective or ineffective (herbal treatments) to the unsafe (chemicals or incorrect medications) to the dangerous (physical harm),"" she said in an email. ""Research shows that self-managing an abortion with abortion pills (mifepristone and/or misoprostol) can be safe and effective.""The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of mifepristone, which is taken with another drug called misoprostol, for abortions up to 70 days into a pregnancy. Demand for the medication -- which the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-abortion rights research group, has estimated accounts for half of US abortions -- surged following the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.""Instead of promoting unsafe methods that have no proof of efficacy, advocates should be focusing on finding ways for people to access mifepristone and misoprostol, or even misoprostol alone,"" Gunter said in her newsletter. ""In fact, misoprostol by itself is far safer than any botanical and also more effective.""The 26 US states seen as ""certain or likely"" to ban abortion after the Supreme Court overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a pro-choice research group ( AFP / Jonathan WALTER, Kun TIAN)According to data from the World Health Organization (WHO), up to 20 percent of abortions globally take place in dangerous circumstances.""Unsafe abortion is a leading -- but preventable -- cause of maternal deaths and morbidities,"" the public health agency says on its website. ""It can lead to physical and mental health complications and social and financial burdens for women, communities and health systems.""Kaitlyn Brown, clinical managing director for the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC), told AFP in an emailed statement that the national nonprofit had ""not experienced an increase in case volume related to herbal abortifacients.""But she cautioned that ""herbs or herbal teas are not held to the same regulatory standards as FDA approved drugs"" and noted that herbal products ""may contain harmful impurities that are not stated on the ingredient label.""She said anyone experiencing side effects can receive condfidential help by calling the national Poison Help line (1-800-222-1222) and additional information is available by visiting poisonhelp.org.AFP reached out to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the US Department of Health and Human Services for additional comment.AFP has fact-checked other claims about abortion here.July 1, 2022 This article was updated to add metadata.Daniel FUNKEAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesABORTIONFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact Check",1
EU parliament debates migration and a green label for gas and nuclear,"At the start of the Czech EU presidency, the EU parliament debates about a green label for nuclear and gas investments and last weekâ€™s incidence at the Spanish-Moroccan border. These are the EU stories of the week.EU green label for gas and nuclear: European parliament votes on WednesdayBrussels (AFP) – To award gas and nuclear power the green label has been widely accepted by the member states, but could be challenged by the European parliamentarians on Wednesday.Classifying investments in nuclear or gas power plants for electricity generation as sustainable would facilitate the financing of these infrastructures. But the recognition of their contribution to the mitigation of climate change has provoked the anger of environmental organizations, who have denounced this as greenwashing. The initiative is also contested in the world of finance. The green label has so far been reserved for renewable energies. (July 1)European Parliament debates about the deaths of migrants on the border at MelillaStrasbourg (EFE) – The debate on the events that occurred on the border between Morocco and Melilla last week took on a European dimension. A majority of parliamentary groups agreed to include debate on the incident in the plenary session of the European Parliament. At least 23 people died and more than 200 were injured.The initiative to hold this debate originated with the left group in the European parliament, which has among its ranks deputies from Podemos, Izquierda Unida and Bildu. They have also suggested to the European Commission to investigate and determine the responsibilities for the deaths and to review all agreements with Morocco on migration control. (July 4)President of North Macedonia: New French proposal on EU accession talks is acceptableSkopje (MIA) – The modified French proposal is a transitional compromise for one of the phases of North Macedoniaâ€™s European integration, and therefore acceptable, President Stevo Pendarovski said.The government of North Macedonia is in the process of consultation with political parties and civil society to gather support for the French presidencyâ€™s proposal to start negotiations with the EU. The proposal includes an amendment of the North Macedonian constitution to integrate Bulgarian minority rights. President Pendarovski showed moderate support for the proposal:â€œBy doing so, we lift the Bulgarian blockade that lasted more than two years, and permit the formal opening of negotiations. We remain on the European track, which is long, and we lose nothing. Now it is time to open the strategic dialogue here,â€said Pendarovski.Pendarovski believes that by accepting the modified French proposal, a decision would be taken to open negotiations with the EU. The biggest opposition party has rejected the proposal. Thousands of citizens have been protesting in front of the government building. (July 3)Prague takes over the EU presidencyBrussels (ANSA) – Paris passes the baton on to Prague and, due to the war in Ukraine, the EUâ€™s priorities for the second half of 2022 change. Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala will present the priorities at the plenary session of the European Parliament on Wednesday. European energy security climbs to the top of the list, with Moscow threatening to further cut supply. This is an issue of particular note for the Czech Republic, a landlocked country with a heavy dependence on Russian gas. So far that Prague says it is prepared to call an extraordinary energy summit in July, if necessary. (June 30)Sloveniaâ€™s Prime Minister Golob criticizes Schengenâ€™s functionality but supports Croatiaâ€™s accessionMadrid (STA) – Slovenia is in favor of Croatia acceding to the Schengen area as soon as possible, but they considered it to be dysfunctional at present. This statement was made by Prime Minister Robert Golob on the sidelines of the Nato summit in Madrid on Thursday. In his view, there were a lot of dilemmas linked to the refugee crisis in the Schengen area. The prime minister expressed hope that these dilemmas would be resolved by talks in the coming months. He added that if Slovenia could gauge the overall dynamic with regard to the enlargement of the Schengen area after these talks, his government would also have more definite answers regarding an expansion to include Croatia. Last Wednesday, the Council of the EU, in which the member states are represented, had asked the European Parliament for an opinion on the extension of the Schengen area to include Croatia. Once the MEPs have given their position, the final decision will be taken by the member states. (June 30)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

EU Parliament calls for inclusion of the right to abortion in EU Charter,"These are the EU stories of the week: After the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the EU parliament takes a stance to strengthen womenâ€™s rights. Meanwhile the ongoing protests in North Macedonia have escalated.The European Parliament calls for the inclusion of the right to abortion in the EU Charter of Fundamental RightsStrasbourg (ANSA) – Following the decision of the US Supreme Court, the Strasbourg plenary approved a resolution in which the European Parliament ""strongly condemns the regression in the area of womenâ€™s rights and sexual health"" and proposes to include the right to abortion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. (July 7)Protests, riots and incidents following the ""French proposal"" for  EU negotiationsSkopje (MIA) –Protests with the slogan ""Ultimatum-No thank you"" against the French proposal for a negotiating framework with the EU have continued in Skopje for five days. Further protests in the capital have been announced for today.The protests began peacefully on July 2 with a demand to reject the ""French proposalâ€. Demonstrators believe that this proposal for a negotiating framework is balanced against North Macedonia and in favor of Bulgaria. The proposal includes an amendment of the North Macedonian constitution to integrate Bulgarian minority rights.On July 4, some of the protesters resorted to violence and demolished protective fences in front of the government and parliament buildings. The situation escalated outside Parliament on Tuesday, when protesters and police clashed. According to the Ministry of the Interior (MOI), 47 police officers were injured and 11 protesters detained. Some state property has been damaged.Yesterday, a violent incident occurred after a verbal altercation between protesters and young people. Firearms were used. The background remains unclear. A suspect, who had fired at the protesters, was arrested in the evening. The government, the president, and the opposition condemned the violence.The demonstrations have no official organizer but are supported by the right-wing opposition party VMRO-DPMNE. More gatherings were announced for the upcoming days. (July 7)""Historic"" digital laws get green light by the European ParliamentStrasbourg (Belga) – On Tuesday, the European Parliament in Strasbourg adopted two laws with an overwhelming majority. These aim to bring order to the internet jungle, curb the power of the big online players and better protect users. Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for the Internal Market, welcomed ""the overwhelming vote"" as â€œhistoricâ€.Breton and his colleague Margrethe Vestager had tabled the proposals for a Digital Services Act (DSA) and a Digital Markets Act (DMA) about a year and a half ago. They are intended to adapt European legislation to an era, in which the internet and major digital platforms have taken a prominent place in everyday life.On the two texts, MEPs reached an agreement with the member states earlier this year. The deal on the DSA was ratified in Strasbourg on Tuesday by 539 votes to 54 with 30 abstentions. This digital services law should provide more protection for users and, among other things, ensure that hate speech and other illegal content is removed more quickly. The basic principle: what is illegal offline must also be illegal online.Validated by an even larger majority of 588 votes to 11 with 31 abstentions, the DMA focuses more strongly on market organization and should lead to a level playing field between digital companies. The law aims to prevent major search engines, social media, marketplaces and other so-called ""gatekeepers"" from imposing unfair conditions on companies and consumers. (July 5)Euro at its lowest since 2002, EU economy worriesLondon (AFP) – The euro plunged to its lowest in nearly 20 years against the dollar on Tuesday, approaching parity, carried away by tensions on energy in Europe caused by the war in Ukraine.At less than 1.03 dollars for one euro, the single European currency has reached its lowest levels since the end of 2002., These were its early days, when there were still many uncertainties for the new currency. Now, it is the risks caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting soaring gas prices, that weigh on the euro.""Growing fears of a recession are driving the euro down, while the dollar is soaring"",commented Fiona Cincotta, analyst at City Index. Foreign exchange traders are betting that the US central bank (Fed) will continue to raise interest rates aggressively to keep inflation under control, she says.

Green label for gas and nuclear investments: What impact will it have on European countries?,"The latest EU parliament's decision to back the labelling of natural gas and nuclear power as climate-friendly divides member countries. While some countries oppose the proposal, it sparks claims of greenwashing by environmental lobbyists.Brussels/Strasbourg – On Wednesday, the European Parliament approved a contentious proposal giving a sustainable finance label to investments in gas and nuclear power. This is part of the EUâ€™s classification system  for sustainable financing called â€œtaxonomyâ€, which intends to channel private investments to help the European Union meet its 2050 climate goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions. The label is relevant for companies, because it may influence investment decisions and thus have an impact on project financing costs, for example. The label also enables investors to avoid investing in sectors of the economy that are harmful to the climate.In a first step, a decision had already been taken last year to classify electricity generated with solar panels, hydro or wind power as climate-friendly. The EU Commission, under pressure from nuclear-powered France and gas-reliant Germany, argues that natural gas and nuclear power have a role to play as comparatively clean sources of energy in the transition to a net zero carbon future.France, which currently operates more than 50 nuclear reactors and is planning to rely on the technology to cut carbon emissions, has been particularly keen in recent months to add nuclear energy to green investment portfolios. Poland has also said that greater investments into in gas and nuclear would help the country move away from coal. Out of 27 EU member states, around half have nuclear power plants.Proponents and opponents have arguments20 trade unions in the energy sector in Bulgaria, Belgium, Czechia, Finland, France, Hungary, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Croatia supported the inclusion of nuclear and gas in the EU taxonomy.""In the event of a positive vote on the resolution, nuclear energy would be excluded from the taxonomy, and this would be harmful to Slovenia, its citizens and the environment,""  the association of Slovenian nuclear experts said.According to them, the use of nuclear energy in Slovenia makes an important contribution to the reliability and stability of power generation, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, stimulates development and increases the domestic share of production.As such, nuclear power is the basis of Sloveniaâ€™s energy independence and part of REPowerEU, the EUâ€™s strategy to eliminate its dependence on Russian fossil fuels, the nuclear experts added. The association also highlighted that maintaining nuclear power in Europe was crucial for the transition to a climate-neutral society.In Italy, politicians are divided. The Italian Minister for Ecological Transition, Roberto Cingolani, finds clear words:""Science is not an opinion, it is numbers. And the numbers say that at the level of greenhouse gas emissions, nuclear power is more advantageous than other technologies,"" Cingolani said in an interview with TG2.Cingolani rather sees the future in new technologies such as nuclear-powered icebreakers â€œthat do not use uranium, produce zero waste, need little power, but are intrinsically safe.â€Critics of gas point to the war in Ukraine as the most urgent reason to reject the green label, saying that encouraging investment would only increase dependence on Russian supplies. Whereas opponents of nuclear power emphasize the threat posed by accidents and nuclear waste and believe solar and wind energy is the best way forward.Resistance by Austria and LuxembourgCzech Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the legal act as a â€œhard negotiated and fragile compromise.â€ A number of EU states can only meet their obligations under the common climate targets with such rules, the liberal-conservative politician argued on Wednesday. The EU aims to become climate-neutral by 2050.The proposal was met with particular resistance from Austria and Luxembourg. Ministers from both countries reaffirmed their intention to pursue legal action against the labelling, should it not be blocked by member states before coming into effect.Austrian Climate Protection Minister Leonore Gewessler tweeted that Austria will file an already prepared request for annulment with the European Court of Justice (ECJ), as soon as the â€œgreenwashing programâ€ takes effect. The Green politician added that she would now seek to â€œwin more allies.â€""We have already prepared ourselves intensively for this case in recent weeks and months and will file our lawsuit within the deadline set for this,"" Gewessler stated on Wednesday.However, it is unlikely that Austria and Luxembourg will find enough allies to prevent the bill from coming into effect.Blockade by a majority of member states considered impossibleThe implementation of the Commissionâ€™s proposal can still be prevented if at least 20 EU states representing at least 65 percent of the total EU population join forces by July 11. However, due to the vested interest of many states in the use of nuclear power, it is considered impossible that such a majority will be achieved in the Council of the EU. The legislation will therefore probably come into force at the beginning of 2023.This article is published Fridays. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1

Russian gas: Nord Stream maintenance plunges Europe into the unknown,"Energy supply remains on top of the EUâ€™s agenda: The maintenance of Nord Stream 1 worries Europe, while Greece and Bulgaria have inaugurated a newly interconnected pipeline. Meanwhile, hopes for smoother relations with the UK have been rekindled and Europe remembers Srebrenica.Berlin (AFP) – Germany, along with a considerable part of Europe, entered a period of great uncertainty on Monday over the continuation of their imports of Russian gas. These had already been sharply reduced in recent weeks and could soon dry up completely.In the morning, Russian giant Gazprom began maintenance work on the two Nord Stream 1 gas pipelines, which transport a major share of the gas that is still being supplied to Germany, as well as several other countries in Western Europe.â€œNord Stream is stopped (â€¦) which means that gas is no longer flowingâ€, Germanyâ€™s Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Action confirmed to AFP on Monday.When it was originally announced quite some time ago, the downtime of the two pipelines had seemed to be a mere technical formality. But in the context of the war in Ukraine and the standoff between Moscow and the West over energy, no one can safely bet on what will happen next. (July 11, 2022)The EU remembers the victims of the Srebrenica genocideBrussels (EFE) – The European Union commemorated the victims, missing persons and survivors of the Srebrenica genocide, which had begun 27 years ago this Monday in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU acknowledged its own failure to prevent and stop the massacre, which is reflected by Russiaâ€™s aggression against Ukraine today.â€œIn Srebrenica, Europe failed and we faced our shame,â€ the European Unionâ€™s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, and OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi, European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, said in a joint statement. â€œEurope has not forgotten what happened in Srebrenica [and] our own responsibility for not having been able to prevent the genocide,â€ they added.Some 8,000 Bosnian Muslims were killed after Bosnian Serb troops conquered the city of Srebrenica in July of 1995, a few months before the end of the Bosnian civil war, in a crime condemned as genocide by international law. (10 July)Successful connection between the gas pipelines of Bulgaria and GreeceKomotini (BTA) – Outgoing Bulgarian Prime Minister Kiril Petkov and his Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis participated in a ceremony to complete the construction of the interconnector between the two countriesâ€™ gas pipelines in the Greek city of Komotini. On July 8, the two ministers symbolically launched the flow of gas.Petkov expressed his expectation that Bulgaria will receive gas from Azerbaijan in early August, thus fulfilling the governmentâ€™s intentions to have a replacement for the stopped supply from Gazprom, which until recently had been their sole provider.The Russian side halted deliveries to Bulgaria and Poland at the end of April, since Sofia and Warsaw refused to pay for the fuel in rubles, which would have been in violation of EU sanctions imposed because of the war in Ukraine.Mitsotakis described the new interconnector as a â€œkey energy bridgeâ€ between north and south, and stated that it brings Bulgaria and Greece closer together. (July 8th)Johnson resigns, EU now hopes for opening of new chapterBrussels (ANSA) – British Prime Minister Boris Johnsonâ€™s resignation â€œopens a new chapter in the relations between the EU and the UK.â€ This tweet by former European Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says it all. It expresses the hope that has been rekindled in Brussels and other European capitals by the prospect of a changing of the guards at Downing Street.It is still too early to say what direction bilateral relations will take – everything will depend on who succeeds Johnson – but it is a fact that from Brexit onwards, things have gone from bad to worse, not least because of the outgoing prime minister.The low point was reached when the British Parliament unilaterally took action to change the agreements concluded with the European Union on Northern Ireland, to which Brussels responded by opening infringement proceedings. On the upper floors of the EU institutions in Brussels, mouths remain diplomatically sealed, waiting to see what will happen across the Channel in the coming days. On the other hand, Barnier speaks up and underlines the possibility that relations can now be â€œmore constructive, more respectful of the commitments made and more friendly. Because there is still so much to do together.â€ (July 7)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Wednesdays and Fridays.

EU member states are gearing up in the face of growing fears regarding a complete Russian gas cutoff,"Owing to mounting fears regarding a possible complete stop to Russian gas supplies, EU member states are stepping up their preparations.The EU Commission has announced that it will propose an emergency plan in mid-July, European states have already started preparing. Annual maintenance work on the Nord Stream 1 pipeline – the single biggest conduit of Russian gas to Germany – started on Monday, but the German government and companies are worried that the shutdown might be extended because of the war in Ukraine.Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist at the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), said the government would be able to avoid shortages if it entered into gas supplier relationships with countries other than Russia, constantly filled storage facilities and encouraged the public to save gas. â€œIf the three conditions are met, I donâ€™t see that we will actually have to face a gas shortage,â€Kemfert said.In the case of conventional natural gas, Germanyâ€™s alternative sources have so far mainly been the Netherlands and Norway. As far as liquefied natural gas (LNG) is concerned, Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck tried to establish new supply relationships during a visit to Qatar in the spring. Whether, when and how much more gas will actually come from the emirate remains to be seen.The filling level of Germanyâ€™s gas storage facilities is rising slowly but steadily. It has currently reached around 65%. The German government has repeatedly appealed to consumers and the industry to save energy.Meanwhile, the French government is preparing for the possibility of a total cutoff of Russian gas supplies, Minister of Economy Bruno Le Maire said on July 10. To avoid shortages, the government has asked for the national gas storage facilities to be filled to ""almost 100%"" by the beginning of autumn.According to a statement by French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne during a press meeting on July 9, the French electricity provider EDF – that the State, holding already 84% of it, intends to renationalize completely – projects that "" production will increase [in autumn], as the 12 reactors (out of 56) currently shut down for corrosion go back on the grid"". However, in case there is a shortage of electricity, the French government is preparing a series of measures for the winter to prioritize private households and certain industries.""Obviously, we are preserving private households and (...) we are not cutting factories or public transport,"" French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said.Romania ahead of European schedule, Croatian storage facilities less than half full, Slovenia launches emergency planAn EU regulation requires mandatory minimum gas storage levels of 80% by 1 November 2022. Romaniaâ€™s Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca said his country will be able to meet the 80% target ahead of time.""At the moment, the country's methane gas storage facilities are 47% full. We are ahead of the European schedule for the building of winter reserves, due to the fact that a large part of the methane gas extracted in Romania is stored. Today (Tuesday, July 12 – ed.), we reached a record and sent 70% of gas from domestic production to the national storage facilities,"" Ciuca added.Croatia announced that it will double the capacity of LNG on the island of Krk from 2.9 billion to 6.1 billion cubic meters in the current energy crisis. The government wants to position Croatia as a regional energy hub in Central Europe, so it could cover the energy demand of its neighbors Slovenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Hungary. Croatia also plans to double the capacity of JANAFâ€™s Adriatic oil pipeline, which can already meet all of Hungary's demand with the existing capacities. The countryâ€™s Okoli underground natural gas storage facility is currently 38% full and is expected to be 90% full by October 1.The Slovenian energy agency launched phase 1 of the gas supply emergency plan. The agency monitors the gas supplies along the routes affecting the supply in Slovenia, including the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. As a precautionary measure, it urged its consumers to use natural gas with care. In a press release, the agency states that the countryâ€™s gas supplies to consumers are currently undisrupted. In the event of lower Russian gas flows, however, the agency warns of potential disruptions in the future.More than half of the targeted storage levels reached in Spain and ItalyAlthough Spain is not one of the countries most dependent on Russia for energy, the government has announced that it will promote an increase in teleworking, encourage public transport and limit thermostats. Spain's Vice President and Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera, has appealed for a ""prudent use of energy"" in the present heat wave.With 72% of its storage capacity reached, Ribera said that Spain is ""very well positioned"" with regard to natural gas. It is estimated that the country owns 40% of Europe's regasification capacity and 45% of its surface storage capacity, a share that could rise to 50% with the next expansion phase of the port of El Musel in the north of the country.The Italian government is preparing a large educational campaign to teach people how to save gas and water.

Snam, the main methane carrier in the country, has announced that stocks for the winter have already reached 64% of total storage capacity at 6.1 billion cubic meters.

Food and energy prices drive record inflation in Europe,"This week, Europe remembers the Srebrenica genocide, while the inflation rate climbs to new heights. ECB President Lagarde welcomed the newest euro member Croatia, the EU Commission calls on Germany to pay its judges better and the EU Commissionâ€™s President travels to North Macedonia. Here are the top stories of the week:Brussels/Belgrade (Tanjug) – Data from the European Commission show that inflation in the EU has reached historical record highs in 2022, increasing by 7.8% year on year in March and by 8.8% year on year in May. At the same time, the National Bank of Serbia points to an acceleration of year-on-year inflation in the country from 10.4% in May to 11.9% in June. In Brussels and Belgrade, it was noted that the record inflation this year has been driven by the increase in food and energy prices as a consequence of the war in Ukraine.â€Moscowâ€™s actions disrupt the supply of energy and grain, increase prices and weaken confidence. In Europe, the momentum of reopening our economies will support annual growth in 2022, but for 2023, we have significantly revised our forecast. Inflation levels are expected to peak later this year and gradually decline in 2023,â€ says European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni.Compared to the same month of last year, prices in Serbia increased by 15.4% in June for processed and by 25.4% for unprocessed food, while the oil price jumped by 4.7% in June alone. In its Summer Economic Forecast, the European Commission predicted that the average annual inflation will reach â€œhistoric highsâ€ of 7.6% in the Eurozone and 8.3% in the EU in 2022, before they will decrease to 4.0% and 4.6%, respectively, in 2023. (July 14)North Macedonia decides on EU negotiation framework as von der Leyen visits the countrySkopje/Brussels (MIA) – The French proposal for a negotiating framework will be presented in the parliament of North Macedonia today. Earlier, in the plenary session, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will address the parliament.Ursula von der Leyen arrived in Skopje on Thursday morning. She will tell the legislative that it should support the French proposal. On Thursday morning, she wrote on Twitter that it was up to North Macedonia to take the â€œdecisive step.â€North Macedoniaâ€™s Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski said yesterday that he expects the parliamentarians to think â€œas statesmenâ€œ and representatives of the people, not just as party members. He said that the government will take â€œexceptional care that Macedoniaâ€™s red lines are not crossed,â€œ and that the national identity and Macedonian characteristics will be preserved during the negotiations. Parliament members are not voting on the proposal itself, but on the conclusions of the government of North Macedonia, giving it guidance on what it may or may not negotiate in the EU accession process.Meanwhile, protests against the French proposal are taking place in front of the parliament building. The protests have been going on for 10 subsequent days. Demonstrators protest over the large influence of one member state, Bulgaria, in the proposed negotiating framework of the French EU presidency. (14 July)EU Commission: Judges in Germany must be paid betterLuxembourg (dpa) – According to the EU Commission, judges in Germany must be paid better. In an investigation into the state of the rule of law presented in Luxembourg on 13 July, the Brussels authority points to challenges in hiring judges. With regard to the imminent retirements of judges, the attractiveness of the profession needs to be addressed as well. Efforts to â€œprovide adequate funding for the judicial systemâ€, including the judgesâ€™ salaries, must continue as part of the new â€œpact for the rule of lawâ€.The EU Commission also sees room for improvement when politicians switch to business, for example. The so-called â€œcooling-off periodâ€ for federal ministers and parliamentary state secretaries after their work in politics must be longer. The procedures for approving new jobs for high-ranking officials should also be more transparent. Efforts to make lobbying during the work on new laws more transparent also need to continue. Plans must be pushed forward to provide a legal basis for the pressâ€™s right to information from federal authorities and to adjust tax exemptions for non-profit organizations. Overall, however, the EU Commission rates the rule of law in Germany as good. The independence of the judiciary continues to be perceived as very high and Germany enjoys a high level of media freedom and diversity. (July 13)ECB-President Lagarde welcomes Croatia in the eurozoneZagreb (HINA) – Eurozone membership puts every member in a better position to deal with the crisis that the EU and the world are entering, stated Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), in an interview with the national broadcaster HRT on the occasion of the EU Councilâ€™s decision to introduce the euro in Croatia.â€œWhen we stand united against inflation, high energy and food prices. We are stronger, we are in a better position. The euro is the second largest currency in the world and is strong in itself. When youâ€™re part of it, itâ€™s certainly a shield for any member country,â€ Lagarde said.Lagarde announced that inflation â€œwill be high throughout the whole of 2022â€, but noted that at the ECB they â€œfirmly believeâ€ that it will start to decline in 2023 and even further in 2024.â€œIt is our duty, it is our mandate, we are determined to reduce inflation to 2%. This will not happen overnight, we will have to increase interest rates over time. But in the medium term, we want to bring inflation back to 2%. And weâ€™ll bring it back!â€ she asserted. Commenting on the fact that Croatian citizens will not, like those in other eurozone member states, immediately feel the reduction in interest rates as one of the positive effects of the introduction of the euro, Lagarde said that the measures taken by the ECB â€œwill hurt for a limited time,â€ but that they will eventually â€œbenefit all, and especially the most vulnerable.â€ (July 12)President of the ECB Christine Lagarde, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡, President of the European Council Charles Michel and President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen at the EU summit in Brussels in June. Srebrenica: Memorial service in PotoÄariSrebrenica (FENA) – Numerous domestic and international officials attended the 27th anniversary of the genocide against Bosniaks in the â€œUnited Nations Safe Zoneâ€ of Srebrenica on July 11. The commemoration ceremony took place in a pre-war Battery Factory, which during the war was the site of executions and mistreatment in July 1995, and today forms a part of the Srebrenica-PotoÄari Memorial Centre.Numerous domestic and international officials gave speeches. President of the European Council Charles Michel said that this tragic anniversary is also a reminder to work together for peace in Europe and for Bosnia and Herzegovina to become part of the European Union. The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Policy, Josep Borrell, said that Europe shares the pain with the victims and their families, and that their struggle deserves nothing but admiration and respect.â€œIt is our common duty to remember the victims of the genocide committed in Srebrenica – one of the darkest chapters in the history of modern Europe,â€ Josep Borrell stressed, adding that the European Union stands firmly with Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans.Secretary General of the Council of Europe Marija PejÄinoviÄ‡ BuriÄ‡ said that no two wars are ever the same, and that the causes and consequences of wars vary, but each carries pain and sorrow. â€œOften punctuated by crimes and events that are so terrible that their names and locations remain etched into our memory long after the weapons have died down,â€ said PejÄinoviÄ‡ BuriÄ‡.The International Commission on Missing Persons (ICMP) assisted in investigations into the Srebrenica genocide and provided irrefutable evidence of the identity of nearly 7,000 of the more than 8,000 people, whose remains were hidden in mass graves in eastern Bosnia. 826 children were killed in Srebrenica between 1992 and 1995, and 694 children were killed in one week in July of 1995 alone, said Dr. Sc. Zilha MastaliÄ‡-KoÅ¡uta from the Institute for Research of Crimes Against Humanity and International Law of the University of Sarajevo. 6,671 victims were buried in farewell ceremonies, attended by the victimsâ€™ families, numerous citizens, political and public figures, as well as local and foreign delegations in PotoÄari so far. In total, the number of genocide victims who have found their peace is 6,721. In July 1995, Bosnian Serb forces overran the U.N.-protected zone in the Bosnian town Srebrenica. Roughly 8,000 Bosniak Muslim men and boys were killed. In 2004, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) ruled that the mass killings of Bosnian Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica constituted the crime of genocide under international law. It is considered the largest post-World War 2 genocide in Europe. This year, after 27 years, the Dutch government apologized to survivors for the Dutch U.N. peacekeepers' failure to prevent the killings.Â (July 11)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Video dates back to 2017 post about Estonian railway repairs, unrelated to EU sanctioning Russia","A video of a railway track being removed has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times after it circulated in posts that claim it shows Lithuania cutting off transit with a Russian exclave after the EU sanctioned certain goods in response to Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine in 2022. Although Lithuania did follow the EU sanctions in blocking certain goods to Kaliningrad, the video has been shared in a false context. It was uploaded in a 2017 post about railway repairs in Estonia, years before Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Keyword searches found no official reports about Lithuania removing the railway track.""Lithuania dismantled the railway track which leads to the Russian exclave Kaliningrad, and the degree of mechanisation is actually quite high,"" reads this Twitter post in simplified Chinese characters.The video has been viewed more than 41,000 times since it was shared on July 6, 2022.In the 28-second video, workers can be seen using specialist equipment to lift part of a railway track off the ground and place it onto a vehicle.The Chinese-language text superimposed on the video translates as: ""Lithuania runs counter to Russia.""The European Union is still discussing how to allow Russia's sanctioned freight to pass through the country in a limited number, while Lithuania is unhappy and begins to dismantle the railway to Kaliningrad, the Russian exclave.""Screenshot taken on July 8, 2022, of the misleading Twitter postKaliningrad, situated on the Baltic Sea, about a thousand kilometres (620 miles) from Moscow, is a highly strategic Russian military outpost in Europe.In June, Lithuania followed EU sanctions by blocking certain goods heading by rail to Kaliningrad.The EU has so far adopted six sanction packages against Russia, including a ban on most Russian oil imports approved in early June 2022.On July 13, 2022, the EU said that Lithuania had an obligation to allow the passage of sanctioned goods, with the exception of weapons, between Russia and Kaliningrad.The video was also viewed more than 500,000 times such as here, here and here on Weibo, and here on Twitter.However, the video predates Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the subsequent EU sanctions by several years.A combined reverse image and keyword searches found a longer version of the video uploaded by an Estonia-based train video channel on YouTube here on October 26, 2017.https://www.youtube.com/embed/y2HHW63T0ocThe caption, written in Russian and English, reads: ""Capital repairs of the railway part 1/8 - Removing old track panels, Estonia, 2017 Track repair 1/8 - Removing old track panels, Estonia, 2017.""The scenes shared in the misleading post can be seen from the video's three-minute 57-second mark.Below are two screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading post (left) and the genuine YouTube video (right):Screenshot comparisons of the video in the misleading post (left) and the genuine YouTube video (right)Contacted by AFP, Martin Kuusk, the person who operates the YouTube channel, confirmed that he filmed the video years ago in Estonia.""The video was indeed filmed in Estonia in 2017 during track complete overhaul,"" Kuusk wrote in an email.

"Europe this week: A historic heat wave, North Macedoniaâ€™s EU accession talks and a government crisis in Italy","A historic heat wave hits the European continent with record temperatures. Meanwhile, North Macedonia starts accession talks that could ultimately lead to EU membership and Brussels reacts to the government crisis in Italy.Heat wave punishes Europe with extreme temperaturesMadrid (EFE) – The heat wave has been hitting southern Europe for days. This week, a warm air mass from the Sahara reaches the north, where record temperatures are expected. The heat wave continues to punish Spain and Portugal with temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius and numerous forest fires have already devastated thousands of hectares.In Spain, the heat wave suffered by almost the entire country is in its ninth day. It is expected that, after a brief relief on Tuesday, a new rise in temperatures will start on Wednesday, leading to a potential continuation of this episode, which is already considered to be long-lasting.Meanwhile, fires continue to devastate thousands of hectares in Spain. Forest fires all over the country are keeping rural populations in suspense, while a special unit with the support of the army tries to suffocate the flames. A brigade member died this Sunday when he was surrounded by fire in Zamora. (July 17 and 18)Bulgaria and North Macedonia sign protocol on EU talksSofia (dpa) – After a long dispute, North Macedonia and its EU neighbour Bulgaria have agreed on a roadmap for the start of North Macedonia's EU accession negotiations. The foreign ministers of both countries, Teodora Gentschowska and Bujar Osmani, signed a protocol to this effect in the Bulgarian capital Sofia on Sunday. The protocol is intended to clarify outstanding bilateral issues, particularly with regard to the interpretation of history.North Macedonia has been waiting for the opening of the negotiations since 2008. Because of a dispute, Bulgaria has been blocking the start of EU negotiations with its small neighbouring country since the end of 2020. Among other things, this dispute centers around the interpretation the countriesâ€™ shared history and the rights of ethnic Bulgarians in North Macedonia. The French EU presidency, which held office until the end of June, drew up a compromise proposal. On Saturday, the North Macedonian parliament in Skopje approved the EU Commission's proposed negotiating framework for accession talks.The protocol, signed in Sofia on Sunday, will reportedly contain approaches and deadlines for settling, among other things, the dispute over the interpretation of history. The text of the document is to be published on Tuesday. (July 17)Croats know about the Conference on the Future of Europe, but most of them do not know about its conclusionsZagreb (Hina) – In general, Croatians are aware of the European Union's Conference on the Future of Europe. However, according to the findings of a survey conducted by market researchers Ipsos and Hina, a vast majority do not know anything about the conclusions of the Conference.As many as 60% of those polled have said that they have learned of the Conference, which was a large-scale project of participatory democracy. However, a mere 4% say they have heard about the conclusions of that project. The Conference was launched on 9 May 2021 and ended a year later with the adoption of 49 proposals for the reform of the Union grouped into 325 directions. The proposals stem from recommendations made by the European panels of citizens, national panels and the multilingual digital platform.The survey was ordered by Hina and was conducted this month by Ipsos among 662 citizens over the age of 18. The method used was CATI (computer-assisted telephone interviewing). The findings show that as many as 70% of Croatians support the inclusion of citizens in the discussions on the course that the EU should take. However, only 33% express interest in being themselves included in such discussions. This poll shows that 42% of those polled have a positive attitude towards the EU, while 15% have a negative attitude.One of the proposals made during the Conference is to amend the fundamental treaties of the Union. The poll conducted among 662 respondents shows that 46% of them consider that the treaties should be amended if this is necessary to respect citizens' recommendations. Only 34% of the respondents believe that only recommendations which are in line with existing treaties should be accepted. Also, 44% of those polled think that member-states should be more independent, while 34% are in favor of greater harmonization and coordination among member states. (July 17)Europe gives green light to billion-dollar support for ambitious hydrogen projectBrussels (Belga) – On Friday, the European Commission gave its blessing to an ambitious project to develop Europe's hydrogen sector. Thanks to a relaxation of state aid rules, dozens of participating companies could receive up to 5.4 billion euros in public support. This is expected to raise a further EUR 8.8 billion in private capital.""Russia's military aggression against Ukraine has only highlighted the need for Europe to diversify its energy sources and accelerate the green transition. Hydrogen is an indispensable component of this,""Vice-President Margrethe Vestager explained.However, there is currently no hydrogen market in Europe and this makes it risky for companies or member states to invest in this innovative technology. State aid can be a lever here to attract private investors. The Commission has a specific instrument – a major project of common European interest (IPCEI) – to allow such support. In this context, the Commission gave the green light to IPCEI Hy2Tech, the hydrogen project in which Belgium and 14 other member states are participating. A total of 35 companies will participate in 41 projects. According to the Commission, the entire project would create about 20.000 direct jobs.The companies Cummins and John Cockerill will be working on hydrogen production technology in Belgium. Other participants will focus on fuel cells, storage technology, transport, distribution and consumer applications. It is hoped that the project will contribute to major technological breakthroughs, such as the rollout of hydrogen mobility. The Flemish government has provided a total of 125 million euros for hydrogen projects in its recovery plans.Brusselsâ€™ perspective on the Italian government crisis: Draghi a close ally of oursItalian Prime Minister Mario Draghi gives a press conference at Canazei Fire Brigade on July 4, 2022, one day after a glacier in the Italian Alps killed at least six people and injured eight others. Photo: Luca Bruno/AP/dpaBrussels (ANSA) – Italyâ€™s government crisis hits EU institutions at perhaps the least opportune time: Europe is in the midst of an energy crisis, begins to struggle somewhat in bringing financial assistance to Ukraine and sees the shadow of a frosty autumn on the horizon, even economically. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, counted on and would like to continue to count on Draghi. Not least because in France Emmanuel Macron no longer has the political strength he used to have, and in Germany, the alliance led by Olaf Scholz is a far cry from Merkelâ€™s GroÃŸe Koalition.Berlaymont Palace commented upon the news of Draghiâ€™s resignation: â€œPresident Ursula von der Leyen has repeatedly emphasized the close and constructive cooperation with President Mario Draghi. Von der Leyen looks forward to continued cooperation with the Italian authorities on European priorities and policies,â€ EU executive spokesman Eric Mamer stressed, on the premise that Brussels, as it is the practice, does not comment on internal political developments in member states.But this July,  inflamed for the gas emergency and overshadowed by a war on Europeâ€™s doorstep with no end in sight, the EU may feel a little lonelier without an ally like Draghi in Rome. Instead, it was up to European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni to address the reporters on the government crisis this morning. â€œWe follow it with worried amazement,â€ the former Italian premier stressed, noting how â€œin these troubled waters with war, high inflation, energy risks and geopolitical tensions, stability is a value in itself, and I think that at this moment we need cohesion rather than further instability.â€On the other hand, Brussels issues a warning that is bound to be relevant between now and 2023: â€œMoscow tries to destabilize European governments through disinformation and through its internal proxies,â€ the Commission once again expressed. â€œTo classify political actors is up to the individual member states, not us, but we observe disinformation campaigns. And Kremlin disinformation is sometimes used by political parties in the EU.â€ (July 14)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Wednesdays and Fridays.

Heat wave smashes Europe,"Record temperatures, drought, forest fires: At the moment, Europe faces an unprecedented heat wave. Spain, Portugal and France continue to battle huge wildfires and northern countries such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are also affected by extraordinary heat.Devastating news from Europe's south continue and even the usually cooler north reported extremely high temperatures this week: The coastal province of Zeeland in the Netherlands reached temperatures of up to 38 degrees Celsius and, to the west, Britain broke its heat record of 40 degrees. While Belgium reduced the capacity of two nuclear reactors, Germany called for the highest level of forest fire alert in 10 of the countryâ€™s 16 states. The ongoing high temperatures are affecting people, water levels and crops in many ways.Last week, researchers at the European Commission Joint Research Centre (JRC) warned that nearly half of the EU's territory is currently at risk of drought. The JRC reported that 46% of the EU's territory was exposed to warning level drought, with 11% at alert level. The EU researchers also warned that the lack of water and strong heat are driving crop yields down in France, Romania, Spain, Portugal and Italy.According to the Italian Farmers' Association Coldiretti, the country's agricultural sector has suffered over three billion euros in damages due to the drought and the heat, and crop yields have been reduced by up to 70% in some cases.Drought and low water levels: Italy's Po and Germany's Rhine are drying upItaly's and Germany's rivers are under strain from the hot, dry weather. The Po, Italy's longest river, with its delta near Venice, is at its lowest level of the past 70 years at certain points along its course. On Tuesday [July 19], Lombardyâ€™s Governor Attilio Fontana said that his region has almost run out of water for agricultural use due to the severe drought that has hit Italy.In Germany, the German Federal Institute for Hydrology announced on Tuesday [July 19] that two of the countryâ€™s major rivers and shipping routes, the Elbe and the Rhine, currently have lower water levels than usual, sometimes forcing ships to lighten their load if they don't want to get stuck.In Spain, as stated by the EU Commissionâ€™s report, water reservoir volumes are currently 31% below the 10-year average, while in Portugal, water to produce hydroelectric energy is at half the average of the previous seven years.Forest fires rage across EuropeAridity and high temperatures have created ideal conditions for fires to spread quickly in many parts of Europe. The last week has seen numerous wildfires erupt in Croatia, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain, among others.Wildfires in Spain, further fanned by strong winds, have destroyed at least 60,000 hectares of land in 10 days, while in neighbouring Portugal, around 30,000 hectares have been destroyed in a week.""Climate change is a killer,""Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said on visiting the region of Extremadura.""It kills people, as we have seen, but it is also killing our ecosystem, our biodiversity. And it is destroying the most valuable goods of our society: our homes, our businesses, our livestock,"" SÃ¡nchez added.Forest fires raging on France's Atlantic coast continued to spread this week and destroyed 20,600 hectares (50,900 acres) so far. Landiras to the south-east of Bordeaux and Teste-de-Buch, directly on the coast to the south-west, were among the affected areas. More than 37,000 people have been evacuated. On Wednesday, the fire department said the fires had been brought under control thanks to better weather conditions, but had not yet been extinguished completely.Friuli Venezia Giulia is among the worst hit regions in Italy. On Wednesday, a huge fire broke out in the Carso area, disrupting road and rail traffic and forcing Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to close their plant in Monfalcone after smoke had covered the northeastern part of town.Wildfires in mined areasIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, still suffering from landmines laid during the 1992-1995 war, fires now threaten to engulf the mined area around Lake Boracko in Konjic. While helicopters have been requested from the BiH armed forces, firemen and the Bosnian mountain rescue service are struggling to extinguish fires in the Blidinje Nature Park. Neighbouring Croatia has sent Canadair firefighting airplanes, but the extinguishing work is difficult due to wind conditions.Emergency measures: cities on red alertAs temperatures soared and approached the 40-degree mark in the Netherlands, gritting vehicles were dispatched to spread salt on certain roads to reduce the surface temperature. Authorities explained that the salt extracted moisture from the air with a resultant cooling effect on the asphalt, which can reach temperatures of up to 50 degrees in the present conditions.The Italian government has set aside 36 million euros for five regions over which Mario Draghi's government declared a state of emergency for drought: Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Piedmont, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Veneto. On Monday [July 18], the countryâ€™s health ministry put nine cities on red alert, which means the heat is so intense that it is considered a threat to the general population. In addition, the government aims to appoint a special commissioner to tackle the crisis and address issues regarding Italy's water infrastructure.Due to the drought, Romania and Croatia are both restricting the use of water. Croatian authorities on the peninsula of Istria issued a directive on Monday banning the use of drinking water for most other uses. Romania's environment minister Barna TÃ¡nczos also announced restrictions to water consumption, to ensure there will be sufficient drinking water in the medium and long term.Record temperatures more likely in the futureThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) believes that severe heat waves, such as the one currently affecting Europe, are to become the norm during the summer months.""Heatwaves of this kind will occur more and more frequently during the coming decades, and the negative trend in climate will continue until at least 2060, independent of our success in climate mitigation,"" WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said on Tuesday [July 19].Looming crop failuresRomania – a major European grain exporter – might deliver much less corn and sunflower this season, as it will prioritize supplying the local market after the drought hit crops, Minister of Agriculture Petre Daea announced. The country is lagging behind other states in expanding irrigation systems and is facing serious problems as climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent. Given the forecasts for more dry weather, some farmers have decided to harvest corn earlier than usual to save what they can, and use the crops in biofuel production. To alleviate the problems, the government plans for the timely provision of subsidies and funds, allocated from the EU as well as the state budget. Main areas of funding will be investments in the irrigation system, the support of the harvest, transport, storage and sale of agricultural products as well as initiatives to reduce energy consumption.This article is published Fridays.

Europe this week: Proceedings against London and serious consequences of the forest fires,"The EU Commission is taking Brexit disputes to court, the government crisis in Italy is worrying the EU and the US, and forest fires resulting from the heat wave have destroyed more than 500,000 hectares in the EU so far this year â€“ more than in the whole of 2021.Brussels (dpa) – In the dispute over Brexit rules for the British province of Northern Ireland, the EU Commission has initiated four new infringement proceedings against the government in London. On Friday, the Brussels authority accused the United Kingdom of violating essential parts of the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. Infringement proceedings can lead to a lawsuit before the European Court of Justice and result in a fine. In a spirit of constructive cooperation, certain infringement procedures had been shelved for more than a year, the EU authority said. ""However, the United Kingdom's unwillingness to engage in meaningful discussion and the advanced procedure for the passage of the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill by the UK Parliament run directly counter to this spirit,"" the EU authority said.Specifically, the allegations are that, for example, current customs regulations are not being respected and that certain EU regulations are not being implemented. The UK now has two months to react. (July 22)Forest fires: More area burnt than in 2021Paris (AFP) - The forest fires that have raged in Europe in recent weeks, particularly in the western part of the continent which has been hit by heat waves, have already affected more surface area than in the whole of 2021, according to the European monitoring service.According to figures published on July 16, fires have devastated a total of 517,881 hectares in the 27 countries of the European Union since the beginning of the year. This amounts to just over 5,000 km2, equivalent to the surface area of a French department such as Mayenne, or the islands of Trinidad and Tobago in the Caribbean.In the whole of 2021, which was marked by numerous fires in Italy and Greece, 470,359 hectares (4,700 km2) had been devastated in EU countries, according to data compiled by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS). (July 21)EU and US concerns over government crisis in ItalyRome (ANSA) - The government crisis in Italy and Mario Draghi's looming farewell are at the top of the concerns of Western partners and European institutions at this complicated time, amid the war in Ukraine, the energy emergency and soaring inflation. ""The ballet of the irresponsible against Draghi may cause a perfect storm,"" Paolo Gentiloni stressed in a very harsh tweet, adding that ""now it is time to love Italy"". ""We have difficult months ahead of us but we are a great country,"" said EU Economy Commissioner, Paolo Gentiloni.The Group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament points the finger at the ""populists and their party, who are responsible for the crisis,"" writes President Iratxe Garcia Perez. The Commission does not officially comment, but refers to the close ties between Draghi and Von der Leyen that it had emphasized just a few days ago.Even from the United States, without wishing to comment on domestic political issues, out of â€œrespectâ€ for Italian decisions, the White House lets it be known that â€œthe partnership with Italy is strong and we will continue to work closely together on a number of priority issues, including support for Ukraine against Russia's aggressionâ€. But it is no secret that even in Washington there is anxiety about what is happening in Rome. At the time of the first rift caused by the populist party Movimento 5 Stelle, Joe Biden, had already stressed that he had â€œgreat respect and consideration for Draghiâ€ (July 20).Decreasing number of asylum applications in the EUBrussels (Belga) – According to the European statistics office Eurostat, the number of non-Europeans applying for international protection in an EU member state fell by 28 percent in April, compared to the month before.In April, a total of 54,145 non-Europeans applied for asylum in an EU member state, 66 percent more than in April of last year, but 28 percent less than in March of this year. According to Eurostat, the relatively strong decline compared to the previous month is mainly due to the decreasing number of Ukrainians who applied for asylum in the EU. In March, just after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, there were almost 13,000 asylum seekers, in April this number fell to just over 1,500. Ukrainian refugees were granted temporary protection in the EU in March, automatically giving them one year's right of residence.In April, a further 5,555 people applied for asylum after an earlier application had been rejected. This represents an increase of 2 percent year on year and a decrease of 16 percent compared to March 2022. In Belgium, according to the figures, 2,320 people filed a first asylum application. In May, there were 2,550 and in June 2,930. Germany was in the lead in April, with over 14,000 applications, followed by France (11,045) and Spain (7,795).

"All talk, no commitment? A watered-down plan for saving gas","Substitution, solidarity and savings are the guiding principles of the EUâ€™s emergency gas conservation plan. Despite resistance from some member states, the energy ministers have agreed on a proposal â€“ diluted by exemptions.On Tuesday, the EUâ€™s energy ministers officially signed a plan to save gas, with Hungary being the only opponent. The plan provides for a voluntary 15 percent reduction in gas consumption by the member states between August 1 2022 and March 31 2023, as well as a mechanism to trigger a unionwide alert to implement binding savings targets in the event of widespread gas shortages.The agreement sees the stringent terms of a first draft by the EU Commission considerably watered down. The plan provides for more opt-outs from binding measures, and the threshold for the introduction of binding savings targets has been raised. Derogations can be requested by those who are able to demonstrate their capacity to export or that their infrastructure is being used to redirect gas to other member states. Another exemption may be granted to states that have exceeded their storage targets.An EU-wide alert on low gas supplies can be declared after a proposal from the commission receives backing from the 27 EU member states, or if at least five EU member states raise the alarm. However, the legal text of the plan stipulates that only theCouncil of the European Union, which represents the member states, may enforce binding saving targets, and not the Commission, as originally proposed.The gas emergency plan still needs to be officially confirmed in writing. The Czech Presidency said on Tuesday that this will be done in the coming days.A plan tailor-made for Germany?From Rome to Warsaw (98 percent of storage capacity utilized), the widespread perception is that the plan is tailor-made for Germany, which depends heavily on Russian gas. Critics say that Berlin has failed to diversify its energy supply and has a lower level of gas storage capacities utilized (65 percent) than most other EU countries. Germany is expected to reduce its demand by more than 10.3 billion cubic meters. German Economic Minister Robert Habeck praised the agreement on the gas plan as a strong answer to ""all haters and all despisers"", which will prove reports that the EU is divided wrong.German Economy Minister Robert Habeck (l) talks with Dutch Climate Minister Rob Jetten (M) and Czech Industry and Trade Minister Josef Sikela during an emergency meeting of EU energy ministers. Photo: Virginia Mayo/AP/dpaEuropeâ€™s largest manufacturing countries, Germany and Italy, both have a high demand for gas. According to the initial EU Commissionâ€™s plan, Italy should have reduced its gas consumption by 8.3 billion cubic meters. In order to reduce its dependence on Russian gas, Italy has invested heavily into diversifying its energy supply. Rome is able to demonstrate its capacity to export and its infrastructure is being used to redirect gas to other member states. Since Italy has already met 70 percent of its storage targets, the country expects to get an exemption from the gas emergency plan, which will allow it to reduce gas savings from the initial 15 percent to 7 percent.Opt-outs for the Iberian PeninsulaTogether with Portugal, Poland and other EU members, Spain was one of the countries that had vigorously opposed an initial proposal by the European Commission. ""Unlike other countries, we Spaniards have not lived beyond our means in terms of energy consumption."" Spanish Minister of Environmental Protection Teresa Ribera said.Both, Spain and Portugal, were granted opt-outs from binding measures to save gas as part of measures to exempt member states with limited overland connections to the rest of the union. Spain has a well-established national LNG structure, which enables it to transfer gas to other countries. Spain praised the compromise and said it will reduce its consumption by 7 to 8 percent in case of an emergency – but would do so voluntarily, not under orders from Brussels.Exemptions for islands and Baltic countriesIreland, Malta and Cyprus will be fully exempt as they are not at all connected to the European grid. Although they questioned why they should participate in the reduction effort at all, even with minimal percentages, the first two confirmed that they will do everything in their power to meet the target.Another exemption applies to the Baltic countries, which are still connected to Russia's electricity grid: If Moscow were to â€œcut off the powerâ€ for Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, the three countries would be forced to use gas to stabilize their electricity supply and could not afford to save on consumption.Slovenia and EU Commission praise solidarity despite exemptionsAccording to the Slovenian Infrastructure Minister Bojan Kumer, EU member states have made a very clear commitment to do more on a voluntary basis and express solidarity. Slovenia is very well connected with its neighboring countries and, due to its small size, has a very low gas consumption. However, it is of great importance to Slovenia that this does not result in the countryâ€™s economy becoming less committed to reducing gas consumption.The risk that so many exemptions prevent the union from saving enough gas does not detract from the plan, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said. EU solidarity ""works best when we recognize that the circumstances of the member states vary widely,"" Kadri Simoson said, glossing over concerns.Open Balkans InitiativeThe energy crisis has not spared the Western Balkans. To prevent any future problems, the countries are taking steps together in the Open Balkans initiative, a platform of cooperation between Albania, North Macedonia and Serbia.Serbia announced it has started building a gas interconnection with North Macedonia, and Serbian Energy Minister Zorana Mihajlovic expressed willingness to do the same with Albania, where an LNG terminal is under construction. Serbia said it wants to become a transit country for the region, with the aim to build connections with North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia and Romania.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: EU court upholds ban on Russian broadcaster in France, Austria votes for EU exemption for fallow land","A top EU court has refused to lift the ban on Russia Today (RT) France. This week also saw the opening of the PeljeÅ¡ki Bridge, one of the largest and most expensive EU-funded projects in Croatia. Austria voted in favor of an EU exemption to have fallow land rededicated to agricultural cultivation.RT France: European justice confirms the suspension of Russian news channelLuxembourg (AFP) – On Wednesday, the EU General Court rejected the request of the state-owned Russian news channel RT France (formerly known as Russia Today) to revoke its suspension. The suspension was pronounced within the framework of the EUâ€™s sanctions against Moscow. Russia immediately announced counteraction against Western media outlets.In its decision, against which the Russian state media has announced it will appeal, the EU court argues in particular that this â€œtemporary banâ€ does not â€œquestionâ€ the freedom of expression â€œas suchâ€, contrary to claims by the Russian state media, which was sanctioned after the invasion of Ukraine by Moscow.â€œWe will take similar measures against Western media working in the country,â€ stated Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov to the press. â€œWe will not let them work in our country either,â€ he added.Accused of being instruments of â€œdisinformationâ€ of the Kremlin, the media Sputnik and RT (including its French-language version RT France) were banned from broadcasting in the EU effective March 2. The ban, pertaining to broadcasts via television as well as the Internet, was announced by agreement of the EU member states shortly after the start of the war in Ukraine. (July 27, 2022)Spain offers itself as an alternative to Russian gas supply in EuropeWarsaw (Europa Press) – Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has suggested that Spain has the potential to become a hub for liquefied natural gas, and could therefore be an alternative source of gas to Russia for several European Union countries. He emphasized that Spain has the â€œmost extensive regasification infrastructure in Europeâ€, and would make it available to European partners, the aim being that the continent â€œshould not be Putinâ€™s energy hostageâ€. â€œSpain is willing to increase solidarity,â€ added Pedro SÃ¡nchez at a joint press conference in Warsaw with Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, on the occasion of the XIV Spanish-Polish Summit.SÃ¡nchez explained that 30 percent of European regasification facilities were located in Spain. Accordingly, the country has the capacity to export gas to other European countries. In this context, the President underlined that last June, 20 percent of the imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) to Spain were exported to other countries of the EU. (July 27)The Commission welcomes the opening of the PeljeÅ¡ki bridgeBrussels (HINA) – The European Commission has welcomed the official opening of one of the biggest infrastructure projects financed by the EU and the largest in Croatia. The 2.4-kilometer bridge connects the village of Komarna on the mainland with the PeljeÅ¡ac peninsula. The county of Dubrovnik-Neretva in Southern Dalmatia is now directly connected with the rest of the countryâ€™s mainland. The two parts were previously separated by a short coastal strip of Bosnian territory.The bridge and parts of the access roads have been open to traffic since Tuesday, July 26, and it is expected that the last phase of the project and the so-called Ston bypass will be completed by the end of 2023. The cost of the entire project, the bridge and the access roads, amounts to 525 million euros, including 357 million euros from European Union funds. Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms Elisa Ferreira stated that the PeljeÅ¡ki Bridge will accelerate economic development and strengthen the territorial cohesion of Southern Dalmatia and Croatia as a whole.July 26, 2022, Croatia, Komarna: The bridge on the PeljeÅ¡ac peninsula connects the two parts of Croatia for the first time, which are separated from each other by a short coastal strip that belongs to Bosnia. Photo: Uncredited/AP/dpaâ€œThe project is extremely important for Croatia, but also for the European Union. This bridge is a symbol of European solidarity and an indicator of financial and political support for Croatia. I am convinced that it will significantly improve the everyday life of citizens and be an important component of Croatiaâ€™s development,â€ Elisa Ferreira pointed out.By shortening the travel time between Dubrovnik and Split, the bridge will greatly facilitate the daily life of Croatian citizens, as well as residents of neighboring areas. The unhindered flow of people and goods means easier access to public services, for example healthcare, but also commercial services in numerous sub-regional centers. According to the press release, tourism and trade will benefit from this better connectivity, and the territorial cohesion of Southern Dalmatia and the rest of the country will be strengthened. (July 26)Austria voted for EU exemption for fallow landVienna (APA) – Austria has approved the EU Commissionâ€™s proposal to extend the use of fallow land for agricultural cultivation until the end of 2023. As a result, â€œwe make an important contribution to global food supply. Every additional ton of grain and food is decisive,â€ said Minister of Agriculture Norbert Totschnig (Ã–VP) in a statement to APA on Monday. National implementation of this exemption is now being prepared.Biodiversity areas of Austriaâ€™s Agri-Environment Program (Ã–PUL) will not be affected by this. In addition to the exemption for fallow land, the EU Commission also proposed to postpone the new mandatory crop rotation requirement for 2023 by one year.â€œIt is short-sighted to sacrifice ecologically valuable biodiversity areas for intensive agricultural production in times of worsening climate crisis and species extinction,â€ criticized the spokeswoman of agriculture for Austrian environmental protection organization GLOBAL 2000.In Austria, only 17 percent of the grain consumed is used directly as food, while 47 percent are used as animal feed. According to the environmental organization, the tillage of ecological priority areas has only â€œminimal effects on the supply situationâ€.With the EUâ€™s agricultural policy reform, which is to take effect from 2023, environmental standards for agriculture have been tightened. To protect the soil, the reform requires that farmers should not cultivate the same crops on the same soil for several years in succession. In addition, four percent of arable land should no longer be farmed in order to counteract species extinction there. This is to be ensured by expanding fallow land areas, flower strips or hedges.Since the start of the Ukraine war, however, there have been demands to relax environmental protection in order to produce more grain. Ukraine is one of the most important wheat exporters in the world. Because of the Russian war, millions of tons cannot be exported. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Austria was also granted an EU exemption for 2022, which allowed for an additional 10,000 hectares to be cultivated for food production.

Posts misleadingly claim human-caused CO2 emissions are too small to warm planet,"A graphic shared over a thousand times on Facebook claims the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) released by humans into Earth's atmosphere is too small to cause climate change. This is misleading: the claim miscalculates the human input and scientists agree that CO2 has a big impact on the planet's temperature. The level of CO2 in the atmosphere has grown sharply due to humans burning fossil fuels and is driving global heating.""Anyone who does an hours (sic) research will come to the same conclusion, human influence on the climate is a sneeze in a hurricane!"" says a post shared on July 24 on a Facebook group named I Love Carbon Dioxide.Under the message is a text graphic about the concentration of CO2 and other gases in the atmosphere. It notes CO2 is one of the ""trace gases"" that make up just 0.03 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.Citing the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), it states: ""According to the IPCC's own data, man-made CO2 output levels are 3% of 3% of 0.1% of the total Earth's atmosphere... that's 0.000009%.""Man is not changing the Climate any time soon.""Screenshot of the false Facebook post taken on July 27, 2022The graphic was also shared on Facebook here and here.However, it misrepresents the widely documented role of CO2 in global warming.The line on ""trace gases"" appears to have been taken verbatim from this page on the site of the US space agency NASA.But it omitted the part immediately following the ""trace gases"" information, where NASA explains the warming impact of CO2 and other trace greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide, methane and ozone.""While these greenhouse gases make up just a tiny percentage of our atmosphere, they play major roles in trapping Earth's radiant heat and keeping it from escaping into space, thereby warming our planet and contributing to Earth's greenhouse effect,"" NASA says.CO2 has 'big effect'Atmospheric scientists contacted by AFP said most of the percentage compositions quoted in the post were approximately right, but the 0.03 percent of trace gases, dominated by CO2 -- equivalent to some 300 parts per million (ppm) -- is closer to the pre-industrial figure.Since the 19th century with the mass burning of fossil fuels, that share has risen -- and shot up since the 1960s to more than 400 ppm.""So CO2 is a minor constituent of the atmosphere. Despite that, it has a big effect on planetary temperature because it absorbs infra-red heat radiation,"" said Andrew Watson, an atmosphere specialist at the University of Exeter, in an email.The IPCC's major climate science report in 2021 contains a detailed chapter on the carbon cycle.A graph on page 713 shows how different gases contribute to ""radiative forcing"" -- the process in which more heat from the sun enters the Earth's atmosphere than leaves it.It is a key measure of human contribution to climate change.The report says that from 1960 to 2019, CO2's contribution to that heat change process was more than 60 percent.'Bizarre calculation'The figure of 0.000009 percent given in the post for human-caused CO2 emissions appears to come from a blog article published in 2018.""The figure they quote is wrong. The earlier article... has multiple errors,"" said Watson.""CO2 is currently at 420 parts per million, that is 0.042 percent of the atmosphere, so that's a one-order-of-magnitude error.""""The earlier article also does a totally bizarre calculation to get the result that 3 percent of the CO2 is due to humans,"" he added.Its method, he said, calculates the flow of CO2 into the atmosphere but not the net increase from human outputs.Watson said that based on his calculations, ""human emissions of CO2 every year... constitute about 0.0005 percent of the total atmospheric molar volume"" -- more than 50 times higher than the figure given in the post.The source article includes graphics which it says are based on IPCC reports from 2001 and 2007. The 2007 report however states clearly that ""among the greenhouse gases, CO2 increases have caused the largest (radiative) forcing"" or heat shift.Of all the greenhouse gases, CO2 is the biggest driver of global heating ( AFP / Jonathan WALTER, Sabrina BLANCHARD)Human activity drives global heatingScientists track changes in greenhouse gas concentrations by measuring the ""carbon budget"" -- the balance of gases from different sources in the atmosphere. This includes carbon given off and absorbed by natural processes -- such as from land and oceans -- as well as the smaller human-driven flows.On this, the Facebook post ""distorts reality,"" said Chris Jones, an expert on carbon cycles at Britain's Met Office weather service and a lead author on a 2013 IPCC report on the subject.""Human activity is small compared to the gross terms of the budget. But as we know, natural fluxes approximately balance and hence human activity is entirely responsible for the imbalance,"" he said in an email.The observatories of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have tracked the acceleration of CO2 concentrations in Earth's atmosphere over the past half-century.This NOAA graph shows how in that time atmospheric CO2 has risen in line with surging human-caused emissions.Datasets from six organisations have tracked the related rise in global temperature.""There is basic physics around how greenhouse gases work. You can measure their absorption in the lab and there is a huge wealth of evidence on both the radiative forcing and the attribution of observed changes to human activity,"" said Jones.""The change in CO2 since pre-industrial (times) is entirely human-caused, and this is from multiple lines of evidence,"" he added. ""In fact we have emitted about twice as much as this change, and nature has removed about half.""Roland LLOYD PARRYAll articlesAFP AustraliaAll articlesFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: EU court gives decision on Sea Watch control, the Eurozone is growing and there's a lot of catching up to do in digitization","The EU Court of Justice has decided: Vessels belonging to humanitarian organizations such as Sea Watch can be inspected, if the state can prove ""serious indications"" of a risk. More news of this week: According to the Digital Economy and Society Index, even the most advanced EU countries have gaps in digitization, and Slovenia plans to apply to EU fund for the mitigation of damage caused by fires.EU Court: Search and rescue ships can be inspected in case of risksBrussels (ANSA) – Vessels carrying out search and rescue operations at sea and belonging to humanitarian organizations such as Sea Watch can be inspected by the port authorities in the state of landing. However, ""the port state may adopt detention measures only in the event of a clear risk to safety, health or the environment, for which the burden of proof lies with the state."" This was determined on Monday, August 1, by the Court of Justice of the European Union in response to preliminary questions by the Sicilian Regional Administrative Courts (TAR) in the case Sea Watch against Italy.The case examined by the EU court relates to events which occurred in the summer of 2020: After having landed migrants rescued at sea in Palermo and Empedocle, the ships Sea Watch 3 and Sea Watch 4 were subjected to inspection by the respective harbor master's offices on the grounds that they had no authorization for search and rescue (SAR) operations at sea, and the number of people embarked clearly exceeded the applicable safety limits.On Monday, the Grand Chamber of the EU Court of Justice for the first time acknowledged ""a fundamental duty to render assistance to persons in danger or distress at sea."" Rescued persons therefore ""must not be taken into account"" when verifying compliance with the authorizations granted, regardless of the type of vessel used. Rescued persons on board therefore do not yet constitute a situation that per se justifies a review. According to the EU judges, the port state may order an inspection, but in order to do so must prove serious indications of a risk on board or to the environment. And it is up to the referring court to verify that these conditions exist.Moreover, Italy ""does not have the power to demand proof"" that ships engaged in SAR activities have certificates other than those issued by the flag state, ""or that they comply with all the requirements applicable to another classification.â€ ""In the event that the inspection reveals the existence of deficiencies,"" a court note continues, ""the port state has the power to adopt such corrective measures as it deems necessary."" They must, however, be ""suitable, necessary and proportionate."" (August 1)Bosnia and Herzegovina: Deportations of illegal migrants from PakistanSarajevo (FENA) – Bosnia and Herzegovina is the first country on the Western Balkan migrant route to begin with the deportation of Pakistani citizens illegally residing in the state.After completing complex and lengthy procedures, the BiH Service for Foreigners returned the first group of migrants from Sarajevo International Airport under the Agreement on Readmission between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Pakistan, which was signed in November 2020, the Ministry of Security of BiH announced.Bosnia and Herzegovina is one of the few countries that was able to sign such an agreement with Pakistan and to start carrying out forced deportations. The readmission will also be used to check the effectiveness of return procedures. Afterwards, it is expected that the return of further groups of illegal migrants from other countries will follow. Pakistani citizens are one of the biggest groups of illegal migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Although the total number of illegal migrants has been significantly reduced in the last few years, around 1,500 of them are still accommodated in special camps near Sarajevo and BihaÄ‡ in Northwest Bosnia. (July 31)Eurozone grows while inflation hits record highBrussels (dpa/ EFE) – The Eurozone economy grew significantly stronger than expected in the spring. In the second quarter, the gross domestic product (GDP) of the 19 euro countries grew by 0.7 percent compared to the previous quarter, as the statistics office Eurostat announced on Friday. Economists had expected an average of 0.2 percent. Compared to the same period last year, the Eurozone economy grew by 4 percent. The development was similar across the EU. Of the countries that have already published data, Spain recorded the most significant growth in the eurozone, while the German economy stagnated.At the same time, year-on-year inflation in the eurozone reached a new record high in July at 8.9 percent. According to Eurostat's preliminary data, year-on-year inflation in the euro area increased by 0.3 percent from June to July. By segments, energy was the main driver of price increases, although rate of annual increase dropped to 39.7 percent in July (from 42 percent in June). The energy sector was followed by food, alcohol and tobacco, which saw a year-on-year increase of 8.9 percent in June and 9.8 percent in July, while inflation on manufactured goods grew from 4.3 to 4.5 percent. (July 29)Photo:  EFE/EPA/SASCHA STEINBACHReport: Digital progress still lagging behindBrussels (AFP) – The EU countries have made progress in adopting digital technologies during the pandemic, but they suffer from a shortage of skilled talent. Small and medium enterprises (SME) are struggling to catch up, according to a report published on Thursday.Among the 27 member states, Finland, Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden are the most advanced in digitization, followed by Ireland, Malta and Spain, says the European Commission's annual report, which is based on the Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI).According to the indicator, Romania, Bulgaria and Greece have the lowest score. The indicator measures progress in four main areas: people's skills, infrastructure, business transformation and digitization of public services.France is in 12th place, between Slovenia and Germany. Even the most advanced EU countries ""have gaps in key areas,"" such as the use of artificial intelligence and big data or the availability of skilled talent, the Commission notes. Only 54 percent of Europeans aged 16-74 have at least ""basic digital skills,"" it said. The EU is aiming for 80 percent by 2030. (July 28)Slovenia plans to apply to EU Fund for mitigation of damage caused by firesLjubljana (STA) – Following the largest fire in Slovenia's history, the Slovenian Ministry of Defense is preparing an assessment of the damage, and Slovenia plans to apply for assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund. The fire broke out in the Karst region and devastated some 3,500 hectares of land.According to Minister of Defense, Damir ÄŒrnÄec, Slovenia may apply to the EU Solidarity Fund for assistance if the total damage caused by the fires in the Karst region amounts to at least 279 million euros. He expects the damage assessment to be completed by mid-September. If the aid is granted, the funds would mainly be used for infrastructure repairs.So far, Slovenia has applied for assistance from the fund four times – three times for flood damage and once for hail damage. The amounts of aid received ranged from 7.5 million to 18 million euros. (July 28)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Wednesdays and Fridays.

Italian government crisis: What's at stake for the EU?,"Italy has the third-largest economy in the EU and is now trying to find a new prime minister. According to recent polls, the right wing parties have a chance to form the next government. The Italians are facing a decisive election â€“ not only for them, but for the whole EU.Italy is set to hold a general election on 25 September, after President Sergio Mattarella dissolved the parliament on 21 July, following outgoing premier Mario Draghi's resignation. The government of national unity headed by the former president of the European Central Bank (ECB) collapsed after a year and a half in power, after failing to get the backing of three important parties in a confidence vote:  ex-premier Giuseppe Conte's 5-Star Movement (M5S), Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia (FI) and Matteo Salvini's League.Italyâ€™s government crisis probably hits EU institutions at the least opportune moment: Europe is in the midst of an energy crisis, begins to struggle somewhat in bringing financial assistance to Ukraine and, as far as the economy is concerned, could face difficult months in autumn. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, counted on and would like to continue to count on Draghi. He is likely to also be missed by other European leaders.Paris fears â€œperiod of uncertaintyâ€Ahead of Draghiâ€™s resignation, the French European Affairs Minister Laurence Boone said in an interview with radio France Inter on Thursday (21 July), that it would open a ""period of uncertainty"" and mark the loss of a ""pillar of Europe.â€The 74-year-old former governor of the ECB enjoys close and warm ties with French leader Emmanuel Macron, with the two pro-EU statesmen concluding a new Franco-Italian treaty last year.Spanish support for Draghi""Europe needs leaders like Mario Draghi"". This was the clear and unequivocal message of support from Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez in an article published on 19 July in the European media Politico.According to SÃ¡nchez, he got to know Draghi when he was president of the ECB and played a ""key role in defending the euro"" by promising to do whatever was necessary to preserve the single currency.Fears regarding the euro and reform backlogThere are fears that the government crisis in the heavily indebted country and third largest EU economy could endanger the euro. The planning and adoption of the future budget could also be problematic if a new government is not in any working order by November.Furthermore, Draghiâ€™s exit raises concerns over Italyâ€™s ability to meet the deadlines set up in its Recovery and Resilience plan worth around 200 billion euros. It is expected to be completed by August 2026, lifting Italyâ€™s gross domestic product by 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent. Italy is the biggest recipient of the EU Recovery Fund and its plan includes 132 investments and 58 reforms addressing the specific challenges of the country. Many of these reforms were expected to be completed by the end of the legislative period next spring.However, the snap elections in September risk to delay or even jeopardize the reform agenda agreed upon by Brussels and Rome. â€œThe ballet of the irresponsible against Draghi may cause a perfect storm,â€ the EU Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni stressed in a very harsh tweet, adding that â€œnow is the time to love Italy: we have difficult months ahead of us but we are a great country.â€Italy moving to the right â€¦The right-wing Brothers of Italy (FdI) party led by Giorgia Meloni, the only major group not to back Draghi's government, is currently on top of the opinion polls, with the support of around 23 percent of the electorate.

Foto: Cecilia Fabiano/LaPresse via ZUMA Press/dpaThe right-wing League of Matteo Salvini is polling at around 13-14 percent and centre-right FI at around 8 percent. In sum, this should give the right/centre-right a working majority in parliament if the polls translate into real votes at the ballot box. This would put Meloni in a strong position to become Italy's first female prime minister. Meloni is the president of the European Conservatives and Reformists Party (ECR), which forms the ECR group in the European parliament together with Spanish Vox, Polish Law and Justice Party (PiS) and others.Such a government could – among other things – be problematic with regard to migration policy and relations with the EU.â€¦ or the left?The centre-left Democratic Party (PD), which is a close second to FdI in the polls, is currently working to forge an electoral alliance considered necessary to beat the right/centre right coalition. According to political commentators, if PD, M5S and a number of smaller parties do not agree on a pact, their chances of stopping the right/centre right appear slim at this point in time.PD leader Enrico Letta framed Italy's upcoming election as a contest between the pro-EU stance of his centre-left group and the Euroscepticism of Meloni's FdI. â€œThis will be the most crucial Italian vote in the history of Europe,â€ Letta said. â€œThe election will give a clear result and it will go in one direction or another. There won't be a draw. Either the Europe of the EU wins, or that of nationalism does. The choice is between us and Meloni.â€This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: The EU would like to better prepare for crises, invests in a new coronavirus vaccine and provides financial support to Ukraine","Energy crisis, Ukraine war, Corona Pandemic - Europe is in the midst of a difficult time. With a proposal, the EU wants to obligate member states to put on reserves. More news of the week: An EU action plan shall improve the rights and freedoms of LGBTI persons in Bosnia and Herzegowina and Brussels purchases 250 million doses of Hipra's coronavirus vaccine. EU Commission wants to protect the single market in crises such as the coronavirus pandemicBrussels (dpa) – The EU Commission wants to prepare for future emergencies such as the coronavirus pandemic or the Ukraine war with a new crisis instrument for the single market. As reported by digital media company Table.Media on Wednesday, with reference to the corresponding draft law, the Commission therefore wants to oblige the EU member states to build up stocks of energy, fuel and agricultural products. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will present the plan in mid-September.On Wednesday, Commission sources said that the aim of the instrument is to ensure the smooth functioning of the single market in times of crisis. The pandemic and the Ukraine war had shown that the first reflex response of EU states could be to close internal borders within the EU. These crises also highlighted the importance of resilient supply chains, they stated.Part of the proposal is a rapid notification procedure for national restrictions on the free movement of goods, services and people. In addition, the EU Commission said the draft addresses better availability of crisis-relevant goods, targeted distribution of national strategic reserves and procurement of crisis-relevant goods by the Brussels-based body on behalf of member states. (August 3)Brussels approves joint purchase of 250 million doses of Hipra's vaccineBrussels (Europa Press) – This week, the European Commission reported the signing of a joint purchase contract with pharmaceutical company Hipra Human Health to secure the supply of 250 million doses of its protein-based coronavirus vaccine, 'Hipra'. A total of 14 member states will participate in this joint purchase. Brussels did not report the total value of the purchase. The agreement will allow for the supply of this protein-based vaccine as a booster dose for previously immunized persons over 16 years of age.This vaccine is currently being evaluated by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). If it receives market authorization, the participating countries will be able to purchase the vaccine under the provisions of the current contract.With COVID infections on the rise in Europe, ""we must ensure maximum preparedness as we approach the autumn and winter months,"" Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides said in a statement.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez welcomed the signing of the contract as ""very good news"". In his opinion, ""it demonstrates the strength of innovation and the pharmaceutical industry in our country, and also the public-private collaboration that we have developed with the Catalan and Spanish industry, which has borne fruit.â€ (August 2)BiH adopts LGBTI action plan of the European Union and the Council of EuropeSarajevo (FENA) – The Council of Ministers in Bosnia and Herzegovina adopted the LGBTI action plan for Bosnia and Herzegovina 2021-2024, with the aim of improving the state of human rights and freedom of LGBTI persons in the country. It is the first Action Plan of its kind in the country and was developed with the support of the European Union and the Council of Europe.The plan includes three strategic goals for the protection of LGBTI persons: to ensure the existence of effective protection mechanisms against discrimination and hate crimes, to ensure equal rights in all areas of public and private life and to counteract prejudice and stereotypes.Bojana Urumova, Head of the Council of Europe Office in Sarajevo, expressed her satisfaction: ""It is of vital importance to protect the human rights of all members of society, including LGBTI persons, to promote tolerance and counteract discrimination. We believe that the Action Plan will help to achieve this goal, and that it will contribute to the implementation of previous recommendations of the Council of Europe and the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights,"" Urumova added.The latest report of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) for Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EUâ€™s opinion on BiH's request for membership highlighted the need to ensure a consistent strategic framework on human rights. Among other things, the action plan includes the adoption of a strategic framework for the protection of LGBTI persons, based on relevant European standards, especially those derived from Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights. (August 2)Photo: FENA/Almir RaziÄ‡Slovenian Ministry of Health wants to increase the allocation of EU funds for health investmentsLjubljana (STA) – The share of EU funds spent on healthcare investments in Slovenia is very low. The main source of financing investments in health care is budget funds with a 44% share, followed by European funds and the corresponding Slovenian own contribution with a 28 percent share.The REACT-EU (Recovery Assistance for Cohesion and the Territories of Europe) mechanism provides 116.5 million euros, but Slovenia has currently used only 4 percent of the funds. The other major source of funding for health investments is the EU Cohesion Fund with a total volume of 71 million euros. So far, Slovenia has only used 20 percent of the fund.Among the projects whose disbursement is already critical in terms of timing is the energy renovation of the largest Slovenian hospital, the University Clinical Centre Ljubljana.""We don't want to find fault for this. Our task is to use as much or all of the funds as possible by the indicative and planned timetables,"" said Health Minister Danijel BeÅ¡iÄ Loredan.He also mentioned the possibility of restructuring part of the funds as one of the solutions. (August 2)EU disburses first tranche of billion-euro emergency loan to UkraineBrussels (BELGA) – On Monday, the European Commission disbursed the first tranche of a 1-billion-euro emergency loan to Ukraine. This major financial assistance aims to help the country with its most urgent financial needs and to keep the public administration running during the war with Russia and beyond.Half a billion euros were disbursed on August 1, followed by a second tranche of another 500 million euros on August 2. Even before the start of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24, the EU approved an emergency loan of 1.2 billion euros. Due to the Russian threat of war, Ukraine was already facing a large outflow of capital at that time and had lost its access to the capital markets.Now that the war has been raging there for more than five months, Ukraine's revenues from taxes and exports have completely collapsed, while expenses went through the roof. That is why the EU came to Kiev's rescue with a long-term loan of 1 billion euros on favorable terms. The interest costs are exceptionally borne by the EUâ€™s budget.To finance the aid fund, the European Commission is borrowing on the capital markets on behalf of the EU. The European Commission also disbursed 50 million euros in financial assistance to Moldova on August 1, of which 35 million euros are long-term loans and 15 million euros are grants. The economy of Ukraine's small and poor neighbor is suffering from the war. In addition, relative to its own population, the country is hosting the highest number of Ukrainian refugees in all of Europe.

"Misleading claims about weather, electric vehicles spread online","Social media posts claim electric vehicle (EV) batteries would ""completely die"" in cold or hot weather. This is misleading; while extreme temperatures do negatively affect the performance of electric cars, they still run properly -- and tests show battery life does last for hours.""Electric cars - the biggest scam the world has ever seen?"" says a July 28, 2022 Facebook post. ""Did anyone think of this? If all cars were electric... And if we were stuck in a three hour traffic jam in the cold of a snowstorm, the batteries would completely die.""Screenshot of a Facebook post taken August 2, 2022AÂ reverse image searchÂ shows the Associated Press tookÂ the photoÂ featured in the posts (archivedÂ here) on February 2, 2011 during a snowstorm in Chicago. It is unclear if any of the vehicles relied on electric power.When it comes to the text of the posts, the same words have been shared hundreds of times on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. The claim comes more than a year after Canada announced it would require 100 percent of new cars and passenger trucks to be zero-emission by 2035.Cold and hot temperatures do affect an electric car's performance, but experts told AFP it is misleading to claim extreme weather would instantly deplete a battery.Heating takes hours to deplete EV batteriesA 2019 Renault guide for optimizing EVs in the winter says ""extreme conditions can lead to reduced range or increased charging time."" That is due in part to the use of cars' heating systems.""In the same way that you will quickly run out of fuel using the air conditioning or heating in a combustion engine car, these accessories also use battery power when in continuous use,"" Alexis Grimaud, an associate researcher at the Solid-State Chemistry and Energy Lab in Paris, told AFP in a July 4, 2022 email.Julia Poliscanova, senior director at the Brussels-based European Federation for Transport and Environment, concurred.""Largely this depends on the quality of the heat technology that the battery uses, i.e. presence of a heat pump & the overall heating strategy,"" she told AFP in a July 19, 2022 email.Poliscanova pointed to studies from the General German Automobile Club (ADAC) that she said ""proved that an electric car uses relatively little energy when stationary, even in winter.""The organization tested the performance of a Renault Zoe ZE50 and a Volkswagen e-Up in a traffic jam in temperatures ranging from -7 degrees Celsius (19.4 degrees Fahrenheit) to -14C (6.6F). The cars' heat was set at 22C (71.6F).After 12 hours, the Zoe had used about 70 percent of its battery, while the e-Up had used 80 percent.""This means that a 3-hour traffic jam would lead to only 18-20% depletion of the battery,"" Poliscanova said.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3E0t0kGeugShe also pointed to reports on a January 2022 test by YouTube channel Dirty Tesla, which measured the battery performance of a Tesla X and a Tesla Y in freezing temperatures. The test followed reports of people stranded on a highway in the US state of Virginia.After 12 hours in sub-zero temperatures with seat heating on, the model Y battery decreased from 91 to 58 percent. The model X, meanwhile, decreased from 90 to 47 percent.""So, based on the evidence known, depending on the model and the heating technology, 8-20 percent of the battery could be used in a 3-hour traffic jam,"" Poliscanova concluded.The impact of cold temperatures on batteries has also been studied in Norway, where government subsidies encouraged drivers to buy electric vehicles.In January 2021, an industry group announced that Norway had become the first country where electric cars accounted for more than half of new registrations.Lars Lund Godbolt, an adviser at the Norwegian EV Association (Elbil), told AFP the country has not faced issues with EVs in winter, when temperatures drop to -6.8C (19.76F) on average.""The (battery management systems) protect the battery and a battery works fine when itâ€™s cold -- itâ€™s just that less of the energy is available until the battery is warm enough,"" he said in a July 22, 2022 email.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBVnJHmMYJA&t=2s""Below -20C (-4F) we see a reduction in range from around 35-45 percent,"" Godbolt said. ""Some of this is because of snow on the roads and that there is more resistance in cold air.""With temperatures closer to 0C (32F), ""we see a reduction of 20-30 percent depending on the EV, amount of snow, etc.,"" Godbolt said. However, he noted that EVs heat up much faster than cars with internal combustion engines, which need to reach a certain temperature before they start heating the cabin.For EVs, ""an average heating system uses 6-7 kW if you put it on absolute maximum (30C or 86F). For 20C (68F) about 2-3 kW,"" Godbolt said. ""And with heat pumps, the already heated cabin then reuses the heat and maintains it at 1 kW.""""With modern EVs (most of them have between 50-80 kWh batteries), you can be stuck in a blizzard and stay there for many, many hours,"" he concluded.The Quebec branch of the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA) advises drivers to plug in their car prior to use in order to preheat the battery, which will improve performance.EVs can also run for hours in hot weatherThe claim that ""batteries would die in a second"" during summer traffic jams because of air conditioning is also misleading.British magazine Which? conducted a test in which a Volkswagen ID.4 electric SUV sat in traffic for an extended period of time with the AC on.""In just over an hour and 15 minutes: We lost just 2 percent of battery from a 77kWh battery,"" says the magazine's report, published in August 2021.Poliscanova of the European Federation for Transport and Environment told AFP that, while heating in gas-powered cars is taken from wasted heat in the engine, ""the energy required for the AC is an additional consumption.""""An air-conditioning system can increase fuel consumption by up to 20 percent because of the extra load on the engine,"" she said. ""In a nutshell, whether a battery electric vehicle (BEV) is less efficient than (an) internal combustion engine when stuck in traffic depends on the efficiency/quality of the battery heating system used in that model.""AFP has examined other false and misleading claims about electric carsÂ here.December 6, 2023 This article was corrected in the third paragraph to say the Associated Press took the photo during a Chicago snowstorm in 2011, not 2021.AFP BelgradeAll articlesAFP CanadaAll articlesCLIMATEFacebook Twitter EmailCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: New Frontex team supports Austrian authorities, EU Commission denied that sanctions are responsible for Russian gas cut","On August 5, the European Commission strenuously denied that EU sanctions are responsible for Russia not being able to reintroduce the gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) supports Austrian authorities in implementing the voluntary return of refugees. Washington says the US is a strong partner encouraging a rapid EU accession for North Macedonia.More EU news is available on the wire services of the respective news agency.New Frontex team supports Austrian authoritiesVienna (APA) – The European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) has stationed a new team in Vienna to support the Austrian authorities in implementing the voluntary return of refugees. This was reported by the Warsaw-based agency on August 4. Four â€œexperienced return officersâ€ now work â€œwith experts of the Federal Agency for Care and Support Services (BBU)â€.Frontex officials will help with the transport of people from various places in Austria from Vienna's airport, bus and train stations, and assist â€œwith all airport procedures such as check-in and security checksâ€. In recent months, Frontex has already â€œsuccessfully deployed officials to support returns at Vienna Airport and four other airports in Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and Franceâ€.Since December 2020, BBU has been responsible for providing basic services to asylum seekers in Austria as well as displaced persons and people who cannot be deported. According to their own statement, BBU's responsibilities also include legal advice and representation as well as â€œadvice and support for returneesâ€. In the first half of 2022, the agency assisted EU member states in returning more than 11,000 people who had no right to stay in the EU. More than 30 percent of these â€œreturned voluntarilyâ€.Frontex was founded in 2004. According to its own information, the agency â€œpromotes, coordinates and developsâ€ European border management in accordance with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the concept of integrated border managementâ€. NGOs repeatedly criticize the EU agencyâ€™s approach. (August 5)Slovenian real estate market expects consequences of tightening euro monetary policyLjubljana (STA) – In Slovenia, the prices of residential real estate increased to record levels in 2021. Data for the first quarter of 2022 showed a renewed increase, but some real estate agents have perceived greater caution in recent weeks. One of the reasons for this development are expectations regarding the potential effects of the recent tightening of monetary policy in the eurozone on lending.According to statistics, prices of residential property increased by 4.1 percent quarter on quarter in the first three months of this year. Yeao on year, they grew by 16.9 percent. The availability of relatively cheap loans during the European Central Bankâ€™s (ECB) lax monetary policy contributed to the high demand for real estate.But home loans have been volatile since the end of spring, and in July the ECB raised key interest rates in the eurozone. The extent to which the increase in the price of loans will be reflected by lower demand is not yet known. The latest data from the Bank of Slovenia for May does not yet indicate a decline in demand, as the volume of new home loans increased sharply for the fourth consecutive month. Year-on-year growth in the volume of home loans was one of the highest in the eurozone at 11.7 percent.Rents are also becoming more expensive, partly due to the post-pandemic increase in demand for short-term rentals of housing through various platforms. According to Zoran ÄukiÄ‡, director of the real estate company Stoja Trade, rents rose by approximately 15-20 percent so far in 2022. This is also reflected by fewer rental apartments on offer in the center of Ljubljana. (August 8)Escobar: US is a strong partner to support North Macedonia for rapid EU accessionSkopje (MIA) – The US will support North Macedonia in its reform efforts in order to move the EU integration process quickly, said Gabriel Escobar, US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State in charge of Europe and Eurasia.Escobar pointed out that North Macedonia is a major bilateral partner and an outstanding NATO ally. ""Juding from our experience with North Macedonia, we regard them as a great partner, loyal friend and strong supporter of the transatlantic community. They have implemented difficult reforms and continue to do so,"" he stated.He continued that for the United States, the question of the language and cultural identity of North Macedonia is not a question, and encouraged the country to continue its constructive dialogue with its neighbours and to commence the accession process as soon as possible. (August 8)Record number of fires in EuropeRome (ANSA) – There has been a record number of forest fires in the European Union so far this year. From January 1 to August 8, the fires have devastated an area of 600,000 hectares, more than the whole of Liguria (542,000 hectares). The figure is almost four times as high as the average of the last 16 years (158,000 hectares).The data is provided by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) of the European Commission. The number of large fires (affecting over 30 hectares) in the EU has also reached record levels: Since the beginning of the year, there have been 2,144, compared to 493 on average between 2006 and 2021. In Italy, 37,000 hectares (average: 34,000) have been devastated in 319 large fires (average: 143) so far this year (August 6).â€œNothing preventsâ€ gas turbine from being supplied to Russia (European Commission)Brussels (Belga) – On August 5, the European Commission strenuously denied that EU sanctions are responsible for Russia not being able to reintroduce the gas turbine for the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The pipeline transports Russian gas to Europe and the turbine is currently located in Germany.Russian energy group Gazprom had cited the missing turbine as the reason for reducing gas supplies via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The turbine in question should have returned to Russia after a maintenance in Canada, but is for the time being stored in MÃ¼lheim an der Ruhr, Germany. Gazprom puts the blame for this on Siemens Energy.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced that the turbine is ready to be deployed to Russia at any time. â€œThere is nothing standing in the way of transport to Russia,â€ he said.â€œThe sanctions do not contain any provisions that prevent the turbine from being shipped to Russia. Any claim to the contrary is simply false. What Russia is saying is an excuse not to supply gas to the EU,â€ added Eric Mamer, the European Commissionâ€™s chief spokesman. Gazprom reduced supply columes via the Nord Stream 1 pipeline to 40 percent of its full capacity in June. Subsequently, the pipeline closed for a few days, after which the gas supply resumed at 20 percent of capacity, officially due to maintenance and technical problems.

EU nations help France to combat devastating wildfires,"This week in Europe: Four planes from the EU firefighting fleet have been sent to France from Greece and Sweden, following a request from the French authorities, as forest fires ravage the southwest of the country. Furthermore, Italy requests the opening of proceedings against Slovenia over balsamic vinegar rules.
Wildfires in France: Four aircraft of the EU fleet sent to FranceBrussels (AFP) – Teams of firefighters from Germany, Poland, Austria and Romania are on their way to support their French colleagues under the EUâ€™s civil protection mechanism, the Commission said. â€œThe EU stands in full solidarity when a country is faced with an emergency situation,â€ European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez Lenarcic stressed in a statement.â€œEuropean solidarity is at work!â€,said French President Emmanuel Macron in a tweet announcing this European aid.Greece will dispatch two Canadair and Sweden two Air Tractor firefighting planes â€œthis very dayâ€, said the French president. On the ground, Germany is sending 64 firefighters and 24 vehicles, expected by Thursday evening, he added. Polish reinforcements – 146 firefighters and 49 vehicles – will arrive on Friday around noon. The Commission also said the EUâ€™s Copernicus satellite had been activated to gather essential data for first responders in the devastated areas.Thousands of firefighters are battling new blazes in France in forests wholly dried out by heat waves and a historic lack of rain. As of Wednesday evening, eight major fires were raging in France, in Gironde (southwest), Maine-et-Loire (west), Jura (east), Drome, Aveyron, and Lozere (southeast), not to mention countless smaller fires breaking out every day throughout the country. (August 11)Italy requests initiation of proceedings against Slovenia over balsamic vinegar rulesLjubljana/Rome (STA) – The Italian government is expected to ask the European Commission to initiate infringement proceedings against Slovenia regarding the geographically protected designation of balsamic vinegar, media reports said. Italy opposes the draft Slovenian rules on the quality of vinegar and diluted acetic acid, which also apply to balsamic vinegar. On December 2, 2020, Slovenia notified the EU of a draft regulation on the quality of vinegar and diluted acetic acid. This draft specifies that any mixture of vinegar with concentrated fruit juice must be labeled as balsamic vinegar.In early March 2021, the Italian Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry addressed a letter to the European Commission, in which it objected to the Slovenian draft rulebook, arguing that the Slovenian move threatens the tradition of excellence of balsamic vinegar from Modena and a market worth about a billion euros. Slovenia rejected the complaints, pointing out that the regulation does not, in any event, jeopardize balsamic vinegar from Modena, and that the same provision on balsamic vinegar was already part of the 2004 regulations.The government of outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi is now set to ask the commission to open infringement proceedings against Slovenia, the Modena Balsamic Vinegar Consortium said on Monday. Given that the European Commission has not issued any binding opinion on this, and based on an EU court decision from 2019 that ruled in favor of a German company selling its vinegar products under the label balsamic, the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food is confident that the regulation in question is not contrary to EU law. (August 11)Brussels leaves it up to member states to limit visas for Russian touristsBrussels (Europa Press) – On Tuesday, the European Commission avoided commenting on a possible veto on tourist visas for Russian citizens, leaving it up to EU member states to limit visas for tourists arriving on European territory by land. This measure would serve to prevent the entry of Russian citizens into the EU through Finland, Estonia or Latvia. Flights from Russia are already restricted within the framework of the sanctions for the Russian invasion of Ukraine perpetrated under the orders of President Vladimir Putin in February of this year.â€œWe have always said that we are ready to consider further sanctions if needed, but we will not comment on future sanctions,â€ said European Commission spokesperson Arianna Podesta. Brussels was in contact with member states, which, she said, have a â€œwide margin of discretionâ€ when issuing visas.â€œIt is important to know that member states have discretionary power in issuing long-term visas on the basis of their national legislation. The short-term visa code does not allow for processes to refuse visas, there are always categories of people for whom visas should be issued such as humanitarian cases, family members, journalists, dissidents â€¦,â€ explained EU Home Affairs spokesperson Anitta Hipper. (August 9)EU Commission approves Austriaâ€™s first tranche of 76 million euros for a just climate changeVienna (APA) – According to its representation in Vienna, the EU Commission has approved Austriaâ€™s plan for a just climate change and the first financing tranche of 76 million euros on August 8. Austria will receive a total of 136 million euros from the Just Transition Fund (JTF). The goal is to prevent negative effects on the local economy and society during the transition to climate neutrality, it was said.â€œThe adoption of the Austrian plan for a just transition together with the first JTF tranche is good news for Austria.â€EU Commission Vice-President Frans Timmermansâ€œThe green economy is our future and the Just Transition Fund serves to support smooth and fair ecological change in the regions of Austria that face the biggest challenges on the road to climate neutrality,â€ continues Timmermans.According to the EU Commission, the regions and municipalities that will undergo significant change are located in Upper Austria, Carinthia, Lower Austria and Styria. There are many carbon-intensive industries there, such as metal, paper, cement and chemicals. According to the Commission, the plan will create jobs and cushion job losses related to ecological change. This is done through investments in the development of new business models and sustainable green business, whereby companies are accompanied in their transition process.The EU has set itself the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050. This means that no more new greenhouse gases should then be emitted into the atmosphere. Tens of thousands of jobs will be lost in coal regions and certain industries, but new jobs will also be created, including in the generation of renewable energies. In the period from 2021 to 2027, an amount of 17.5 billion euros is to be invested from the JTF in the regions most affected by the transition to a climate-neutral economy. (August 9)Germany is sending 50 members of the Bundeswehr to EUFOR in Bosnia and HerzegovinaSarajevo (HINA) – By the end of August, Germany will send a contingent of soldiers to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). It was confirmed on Monday by the EUFOR command in Sarajevo that the German soldiers will join the European Unionâ€™s peacekeeping forces in BiH and operate there as part of Operation Althea. In July, Germanyâ€™s federal parliament (Bundestag) had approved the plan of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to provide reinforcements for EUFOR, as political tensions are on the rise in BiH.For the time being, 50 members of the Bundeswehr will be sent to Bosnia and Herzegovina and their deployment will begin in the middle of this month. German officers and soldiers will operate from the EUFOR headquarters headed by Austrian General Anton Wessely. They will also be part of the observation teams deployed throughout the country. Germany is sending its soldiers to BiH despite the opposition of the current Serb member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milorad Dodik. After the Bundestag supported such a plan, Dodik stated that the aim was to â€œintimidate the citizens of Republika Srpskaâ€. EUFOR, which replaced the NATO-led peacekeeping force (SFOR) in 2004, currently has around 1,100 soldiers from 19 countries in BiH, with a mandate to monitor compliance with the military provisions of the Dayton Agreement and to respond to security threats.

How Europe is facing the global food crisis,"Monitoring, relaxing regulations and keeping up grain imports: In the midst of a global food crisis with prices at an all-time high, the EU tries to prevent food shortages. While the EU is trying to counteract this, many countries in Europe are struggling with rising prices.The EU's response to the global food crisis is to monitor crop storage levels in member states, to ease environmental regulations in order to boost food production, and to find alternative shipping routes for Ukrainian grain exports. However, an unprecedented drought has raised fears that Europe's crop yields will decline. This would further drive up food prices, which have already increased substantially, partly due to the war in Ukraine.Despite the resumption of grain exports from Ukraine's Black Sea ports under a deal between Russia and Ukraine, brokered by the UN and Turkey, concerns over grain exports remain. According to EU figures, it is considered highly unlikely that pre-war levels of up to 5 million tons of grain passing through the ports each month will be reached again in the near future. The first ship that left the port of Odessa under the UN deal carried just 26,000 tons of maize. Finding alternative export routes is still crucial, an EU Commission official said.EU Commission relaxes farming regulations to boost food productionIn the face of impending food shortages, the European Commission is now relaxing environmental regulations previously imposed on farms in order to facilitate a larger food production. The commission proposed granting one-year exemptions from crop rotation rules and the stipulation to convert arable areas into fallow land. The reform of the EUâ€™s agricultural policy, which is to take effect from 2023, has resulted in tougher environmental standards for agriculture. These include requirements that farmers should protect the soil by not cultivating the same crops on it for several years in succession.However, demands had been growing to relax these environmental protection standards to allow for more grain to be produced, since less can be shipped from Ukrainian ports affected by the war. Every ton of cereals produced in the EU will help to increase global food security, the Commission said.Germany and Austria take advantage of the Commission's relaxationsAustria has agreed to the EU Commission's proposal to extend the use of fallow land for agricultural production until the end of 2023. At the same time, German Minister of Agriculture Cem Ã–zdemir made a proposal to allow farmers to use a greater portion of their land to grow cereal crops, given the shortages on the global market. Berlin is to suspend the new EU regulations concerning crop rotation for a year. While lawmakers and farming associations welcomed the proposal, environmental activist group Greenpeace harshly criticized the minister for buckling under pressure from the agricultural lobby.France: Disaster for farmers, ecosystems and biodiversityFaced by a ""historic"" drought, exacerbated by a third extreme heatwave, the French government has activated a crisis task force on August 5 to coordinate efforts to alleviate the impacts. ""This drought is the worst ever recorded in our country,"" the office of Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne said in a statement. The dry conditions are a ""disaster"" for farmers across the country as well as for ""our ecosystems and biodiversity"", she added.Restrictions on water consumption have already been introduced in nearly all of France's 96 mainland departments, with 73 at the highest alert level. However, the government statement did not address growing criticism over exemptions that have been granted to golf courses. They are allowed to continue watering their greens, even in departments now on drought crisis alert.Several European countries have also issued severe drought warnings, with the EU urging members to re-use treated urban wastewater on the continent's parched farms.Inflation continues to surge in SpainIn Spain, consumers continue to be heavily affected by increasing food prices. These were triggered first by the pandemic, then by the increase in electricity and fuel prices – which led to protests and strikes in the agricultural sector – and finally by the war in Ukraine. Back in July, the Spanish Organisation of Consumers and Users (OCU) had already warned about a 15.2 percent year on year increase in the cost of living basket. A sharp surge that especially affects lower-income households. In June, the record price for a honeydew melon amounted to 13 euros. According to the National Statistics Institute (INE), the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose by 1.9 percent in June and the year-on-year inflation rate rose by 1.5 points to 10.2 percent, the highest level since April of 1985.The Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas, wants world food markets to be more transparent in order to achieve a stabilization of prices. ""More transparency can and must be given to the markets,"" the minister emphasized, citing as an example the recent decision by EU countries to notify the Commission of their monthly data on storage levels of cereals, rice and oilseeds. He also referred to the G20 platform Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS) as a useful instrument to enhance food market transparency. Planas also called for support to the most vulnerable countries in need of purchasing cereals.Food prices increase by over 23 percent in BosniaBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) faces an inflation rate of 15.8 percent, and the prices for food and soft drinks rose by 23.4 percent. The country relies mainly on food imports and has insufficient reserves to significantly intervene in the market. Traders often use their monopolistic position to keep prices artificially high. Owing to a large number of tourists and the fact that the country's diaspora population returns to the homeland during the summer months, the present demand for goods is quite high.Economic analysts expect that the beginning of autumn will bring a drop in demand and that this will force retailers to reduce their prices for many food products. Comparative data shows that despite the increases for many basic food products in Bosnia and Herzegovina, prices are still lower than in the neighbouring countries.Inflation rate reaches the 16-percent-mark in North MacedoniaAccording to the Federation of Trade Unions of Macedonia (SSM), the current inflation significantly reduces the purchasing power of wages. Purchasing power of the minimum monthly wage has declined from 290 euros to 244 euros, while the purchasing power of an average wage now amounts to 428 euros instead of 510 euros.North Macedonia is import-dependent for certain basic food products, such as wheat, cooking oil, meat and milk. According to calculations by SSM, minimum expenses for a family amounted to about 760 euros in July. The income amount is not sufficient for families with two earners if one earns an average and the other a minimum wage.Croatia: Hardly any price reductions in stores despite VAT-reductionsFollowing the trend of other EU countries, Croatia reduced VAT on energy, sanitary and food products in an attempt to alleviate the impact of the current high prices. VAT rate, in effect since April 1, is cut down from 25 percent and 13 percent respectively to 5 percent. The Croatian Consumer Protection Association (HUZP) called on the State Inspectorate several times to carry out checks of food prices, because, contrary to expectations, there have been no price decreases.However, as in other EU member states, a huge amount of food is wasted in the country. Croatians throw away about 71 kg of food per capita every year, totaling at over 280,000 tons, and 76 percent of that comes from households, while the EU average is 53 percent, said Branka Ilakovac, the president of the Food Waste Prevention Center (CEPOH). Prevention and the education of citizens have not been recognized in Croatia as key factors in counteracting the wasting of food, she added.According to estimates, the citizens of EU countries throw away 88 million tons of food per year, with a total value of 143 billion euros, Ilakovac said. She added that Croatia, as an EU member state, has set itself the target of reducing the waste of food by 50 percent by 2030.Romania will not limit wheat exportsAs of August 3, Romania has harvested more than 94 percent of its wheat. Minister of Agriculture Petre Daea assured that this year's production will cover the country's needs and leave room for exports. Although Romania says it will not limit wheat exports, Daea stressed that the country will serve the domestic market first and only the remainder will be exported.284,376 hectares of the countryâ€™s surface area were affected by drought as of August 10. In total, in Romania, 154,500 hectares are cultivated with wheat and triticale, 22,598 hectares with barley, oats and rye, 25,000 hectares with rapeseed, 49,910 hectares with maize, 3,141 hectares with soya, 702 hectares with peas, 20,054 hectares with sunflowers, 3,952 hectares with fodder crops and 4,427 hectares with other crops.However, the country is not spared from food price increases. Since July 2021, cooking oil saw the highest price increase at 49.71 percent, potato prices increased by 42.18 percent and flour prices by 33.16 percent. Bucharest has taken several measures to protect those affected by price increases with meal vouchers and other forms of government aid.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Pristina-Belgrade dialogue in Brussels, records set by forest fires in Europe and Slovenia to tackle rising food prices","The leaders of Serbia and Kosovo met in Brussels in an attempt to find solutions to unresolved issues. Also this week: The high season for forest fires is not over yet, but the provisional fire toll already indicates a new record.VuÄiÄ‡ and Kurti at the same table in BrusselsBrussels (Tanjug) – The President of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Aljbin Kurti, met today in Brussels for a new round of the Pristina-Belgrade EU-mediated dialogue on the normalization of relations between Belgrade and Pristina. Before the meeting, both leaders spoke separately with EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.""Recent tensions in the north of Kosovo have demonstrated yet again that it is time to move forward towards full normalisation. I expect both leaders to be open and flexible to find common ground,"" said Borrell.Ahead of the meeting, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ said that he expects difficult discussions, stating that this is ""the beginning of discussions about the essential problems in Kosovo and Metohija"".""I hope for some kind of solution, although I don't believe in it at all,"" stated VuÄiÄ‡.After the meeting, the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Security Josep Borell said that the delegations of Belgrade and Pristina did not reach an agreement, but that it was agreed to continue the talks in the following days. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Serbia, as well as five EU member states, have not recognized Kosovo's sovereignty to this day. (August 18)Von der Leyen applauds energy-saving measures in SpainBrussels (Europa Press) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenapplauded the energy-saving measures implemented in Spain and the other EU member states, in particular the regulation of air conditioning, noting that the measures contribute to the EU reaching its objectives for the winter.In a series of messages on social networks, von der Leyen pointed out that setting ""somewhat higher"" temperatures for air conditioning achieves ""impressive results"".""Together, we save energy for a safe winter,"" reads the message of the EU Commissionâ€™s president, which goes on to state that – according to calculations by Brussels – the savings achieved by setting a higher temperature for air conditioners equal the energy consumption of a member state like Malta.The German conservative politician also highlights measures implemented by Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, such as lowering the heating temperature in homes by one degree, which, according to von der Leyen, can save 7 percent energy during one heating period. (August 17)Forest fires: a record summer of burned surfaces in EuropePeople walk on the Dune of Pilat (Dune du Pilat) near La Teste-de-Buch, while smoke rises in the background. Foto: Gaizka Iroz/AFP/dpaParis (AFP) – Since January 1, fires have ravaged 662,776 hectares of forests in the European Union. This is according to data updated on August 14 by the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS), which has been keeping comparable statistics since 2006, thanks to satellite images from the European Copernicus program.France had worse years in the 1970s, when there was no standardized European data. But so far, 2022 has been the worst in 16 years, according to these figures. This is mainly due to two successive large fires in the French Gironde region in the southwest of the country, where German, Polish and Austrian firefighters arrived this week as reinforcements.The situation is also exceptional in Central Europe: In July, it took firefighters more than ten days to bring the largest fire in Slovenia's recent history under control, supported by a population so mobilized that the government had to ask residents to stop donating to the fire department.The area hardest hit by the fires, however, is the Iberian Peninsula. In Spain, which like France was parched by several heat waves this summer, 246,278 hectares were devastated by fires, mainly in Galicia in the northwest. However, the situation has eased as temperatures have dropped. Portugal has also been battling a fire for more than a week in the UNESCO Global Geopark Serra da Estrela, a mountain region in continental Portugal which rises to about 2,000 meters. (August 15)Slovenian government starts to tackle rising food prices with price controls. If necessary, further measures will follow in OctoberLjubljana (STA) – The government has decided to start with soft regulation to tackle high food prices, namely by monitoring the prices of basic foodstuffs. ""In October, we will know whether there is a need for harder regulation in the area of nutrition,"" said Prime Minister Robert Golob. If necessary, the government will also introduce a nutritional subsidy to follow the energy subsidy.According to Golob, the government regards energy prices as a much more serious problem – prices have risen by up to 300, 400 and even 500 percent – and has already decided to regulate prices and to provide a subsidy, which is expected to be granted to an estimated 50,000 families, Slovenia has a population of 2.1 million. As regards nutrition, the government will initially monitor the price of a basket of basic foodstuffs, for which it has already selected a contractor through a public tender.""We will continuously monitor the basket, which will not be fixed but will change weekly or fortnightly. We will see the evolution of product prices over time and compare them to prices of the same products in neighboring countries,"" said Golob. The effects of the monitoring of staple food prices and the impact on inflation should be visible as early as September, he said, with the government assessing a month later whether more stringent measures will be needed. (August 12)European Commission wants more gas interconnections between Spain and France, in line with Germany's requestBrussels/Berlin/Madrid/Lisbon (EFE) – The European Commission wants energy interconnections between France and Spain to be strengthened. It aims to develop ongoing electricity projects and to create new infrastructure to take advantage of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals on the Iberian Peninsula. In the future, this infrastructure would also be used to transport hydrogen, a spokesperson of the EUâ€™s executive told EFE.In order to reduce the current dependence on Russian gas, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz advocates a pipeline to transport gas from Portugal through Spain and France to the rest of Europe. Scholz regrets that this had not yet been built. The ""massive contribution"" such a pipeline could make to the supply of northern Europe is now ""dramatically"" lacking, he said at a press conference on August 11.The Spanish part of that pipeline could be operational in ""eight or nine months"", according to Spanish Vice-President and Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera. For his part, Portuguese Prime Minister, socialist AntÃ³nio Costa, assured that Germany could count ""100 percent"" on his country. In addition to two gas pipelines with Algeria, the Iberian peninsula has 33 percent of the EU's liquefied natural gas terminals. What is missing is the infrastructure to send this gas to the rest of Europe, stated the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) in its annual report, published on July 27.

Is Europe ready for a new wave of migration?,"As Europe is seeing an influx of refugees, 21 EU member states have signed a voluntary solidarity mechanism on June 22, which is supposed to relieve southern countries like Italy.
Overall, 155,090 migrants arrived in the European Union from January to July, according to the European border agency Frontex. The number of migrants arriving in the EU rose by 86 percent compared to the same period last year. Ukrainian refugees crossing the borders into the EU were not included in these figures.For years, it has been the approach of European asylum policy to let individual member states pursue their own policies. Therefore, Brussels considers it a success that most EU countries agreed on a solidarity mechanism in June. This allows other EU members to either take over refugees from Italy, Spain, Malta, Greece and Cyprus, or to help with money and in-kind services. 13 states want to participate in taking over refugees. They have made commitments for a total of just over 8,000 people. Germany is taking almost half (3,500), and the first people are to be relocated from Italy in August. In return for this help, the southern states are given new tasks in identifying those seeking protection. In the future, it should be possible to immediately deport refugees with no prospect of being granted asylum.So far, no progress has been made at EU level on sea rescue. Since the large-scale flight movements of 2015/16 and the resulting distortions between EU countries, any state-supported and EU-coordinated sea rescue seems unimaginable. The central Mediterranean route from North Africa to Southern Europe was used by more than 42,500 migrants between January and July 2022, an increase of 44 percent compared to the first seven months of last year.Spain's Mediterranean coasts, including those of its islands of Majorca (Mediterranean Sea) and the Canary Islands (Atlantic Ocean), often used to be the destination of the small boats in which migrants from Africa set out on their route towards the last stretch of their European dream. The Spanish President, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, said on August 16 that there is a ""downward trend"" in the arrival of immigrants in Spain compared to last year. A fact that ""should be celebrated"" and which he attributes to the fact that ""we are working well"" with the transit countries.Western Balkan â€œthe most activeâ€ migratory routeThe Western Balkan route continues to be ""the most active"", with more than 14,866 irregular border crossings, ""nearly three times as many"" as recorded in July of last year. The main nationalities on this route were migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Turkey. On the EU's eastern border, in Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Poland, Slovakia and Romania, the number of illegal crossings has declined by 32 percent year-on-year to 2,923 since the beginning of 2022. The main nationalities present on this route were Ukrainian, Iraqi and Belarusian. Meanwhile, compared to the period from January to July of 2021, channel crossings from continental Europe to the United Kingdom increased by 55 percent to 28,000 cases detected, according to Frontex.Emergency at the Latvian border with BelarusMeanwhile, Latvia has extended the state of emergency on the border with Belarus until November 10. This was decided by the government in Riga on August 16. The state of emergency has already been in effect for almost exactly one year. It was declared in August 2021, because thousands of migrants wanted to cross the EUâ€™s external borders into Poland or the Baltic states. The European Union accuses Belarusian ruler Alexander Lukashenko of deliberately organizing to bring migrants from crisis regions to the EU's external border.With the extension of the state of emergency, the Latvian border guard is remains authorized to send back migrants who entered the country illegally from Belarus. According to the Interior Ministry in Riga, the number of illegal border crossings has recently decreased. Nevertheless, the border guard will have to continue to deal with migrants trying to cross into Latvia from Belarus. Another important factor for the renewed extension of the state of emergency is Russia's war in Ukraine. Latvia borders Russia and its authoritarian-ruled ally Belarus. According to official figures, nearly 6,800 attempts by migrants to cross the border illegally have been prevented in Latvia since the state of emergency was declared.Russian war causes wave of Ukrainian refugeesAccording to Frontex, 7.7 million Ukrainian citizens have entered the EU since the start of the Russian invasion in February. However, according to the European Commission, the influx of Ukrainian refugees into the EU is relatively constant at present.More than 700,000 Ukrainian people have come to neighboring Slovakia. That is according to figures from the Interior Ministry in Bratislava, which the state news agency TASR published on August 15. Until Sunday, the total number of border crossings since the beginning of the war had reached 699,874. Recently, between three and four thousand people have arrived every day. Relative to its own population of just 5.5 million, Slovakia is thus the EU country that has taken in the greatest number of Ukrainian refugees, at least temporarily. In the same period, 3.7 million Ukrainians came to Poland, more than five times as many as to Slovakia.Photo: Ukrinform/dpaAt present, the number of people arriving in the EU roughly equals the number entering Ukraine from the European Union, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said in an interview with several news agencies. Every day, between 35,000 and 40,000 people travel from the EU to Ukraine. At the same time, Johansson stressed that this was not the number permanent returnees. Some of them simply live in the border region.In recent weeks, people have returned to Ukraine from Slovakia and Poland than have entered those countries from there. ""At the moment, we don't see many people coming. Therefore the focus is on supporting those who want to return,"" Johansson said. But caution is still necessary in the light of the Russian war on Ukraine. If the situation worsens, people are always welcome back in the EU, she said. Reliable data on how many people decided to return permanently does not exist.This article is published Fridays. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Monkeypox is not 'only circulating in countries distributing Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine',"Multiple social media posts shared hundreds of times claim that the latest outbreak of monkeypox is only occurring in countries that have administered Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid-19 vaccine. The posts go on to claim the World Health Organization (WHO) ""has not received a single report"" of monkeypox from countries not administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Medical experts, however, told the AFP there is no evidence linking the virus, which has existed for decades, to the Covid vaccine. As of August 9, 2022, most countries that were administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had not recorded cases of monkeypox. Conversely, several countries -- including India, Russia and Venezuela -- where the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has not been distributed had reported monkeypox casesTwo maps were shared in this post published on Facebook on July 26.The post's caption reads in part: ""â€˜Monkeypoxâ€™ Is Only Circulating In Countries Where Pfizer Vaccine Has Been Distributed. Think about that for a moment.""The top map includes the WHO's logo and purports to show countries that have reported monkeypox cases since May 2022.It also highlights several countries in Africa with a red circle, saying monkeypox has been ""endemic"" in those states for more than 50 years.The bottom map purports to show countries where the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has been approved for use.The maps were taken fromÂ thisÂ June 24 article on The Daily Expose website, which hasÂ previouslyÂ publishedÂ inaccurateÂ claimsÂ debunked by AFP.Monkeypox, so called because it was first discovered in a monkey, is related to the deadly smallpox virus, which was eradicated in 1980, but is far less severe.Early signs of the disease include a high fever, swollen lymph glands, and a chickenpox-like rash.In May 2022, a flurry of cases was detected in countries outside Africa in people with no travel links to the region, AFP reported.The WHO last month declared the outbreak to be a global health emergency -- the highest alarm it can sound.Posts containing a similar claim about the origins of monkeypox were shared hundreds of times in Australia, the US, and Japan.But medical experts told AFP the claim that monkeypox outbreaks are linked to Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid vaccine is false.No correlationAccording to the WHO, although monkeypox is not highly contagious, it can be ""transmitted from one person to another by close contact with lesions, body fluids, respiratory droplets and contaminated materials such as bedding.""Jaya Dantas, professor of international health at Australia's Curtin University, said she had found no correlation between recent monkeypox outbreaks and the countries where the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine has been administered.""The Pfizer vaccine has been administered in 180 countries and most of these do not have any cases of monkeypox,"" Dantas told AFP.Peter Collignon, a professor from the Australian National University Medical School, told AFP that monkeypox existed for decades before Covid-19 vaccines were created.""Monkeypox has been known for decades, long before Covid-19 vaccines have been developed,"" Collignon said.He went on to say that some mRNA vaccines -- such as the one developed by Pfizer-BioNTech -- have ""side effects but serious ones are relatively uncommon"".The claim that the WHO has not received reports of monkeypox cases from countries not using the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is also false.Some countries -- including India, Russia and Venezuela -- have reported at least one case of monkeypox as of August 9 but their respective health authorities do not administer Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine to the public.A Pfizer spokesperson told AFP that governments and experts around the world have continually reviewed the vaccine's data to ensure it is safe. ""The safety profile for the vaccine for all authorised groups continues to be favourable,"" the spokesperson said.Old and altered mapsThe WHO also told AFP that the map that purports to show the spread of monkeypox around the world had been altered.""The red writing and circle have been added. Also, the heading in bold is not ours,"" a WHO spokesperson said.A search on the WHO website found the altered map was taken from a situation report published on June 27, 2022.Below is a comparison of the altered map (left) and the original map published by the WHO (right):The spokesperson went on to say the claim that ""health authorities are scrambling to cover up the damage of injecting millions of people with an experimental mRNA injection"" is false.The other map in the false posts that purports to show the distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is outdated.It was published as part of an article in the Postgraduate Medical Journal first published in August 2021 showing the distribution of Pfizer vaccines as of May 16, 2021What's causing the outbreak?The first human case of monkeypox was reported in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1970.Collignon said mutations and increasing levels of international travel after the lifting of Covid-related restrictions have contributed to recent outbreaks outside of Africa.""Monkeypox spreads through skin-to-skin contact, that's why it's spreading,"" he said.The WHO wrote in its latest update in June that the wide geographic spread of cases indicates that the monkeypox virus ""might have been circulating below levels detectable by the surveillance systems and sustained human-to-human transmission might have been undetected for a period of time"".AFP has previously debunked claims of adverse effects caused by the Covid vaccine; including that the vaccine is linked to shingles; that monkeypox is a side-effect caused by the Covid vaccine; and that the vaccine will weaken the immune system.Kate TANAll articlesAFP AustraliaAll articlesViruela del mono COVID-19 VACCINESFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: Several leaders call for restraint in attack on Ukrainian nuclear power plant, Germany seeks to strengthen its energy partnership with Canada and Austria retains sanctions against Russia","Europe's largest nuclear power plant is under attack in Ukraine. An accident could lead to a major disaster for the region and, depending on the direction of the wind, for Europe as well. Apart from that: In the run-up to the ratification of the EU's CETA trade agreement with Canada, Germany is aiming to strengthen its economic and energy partnership with the country.
Ukraine nuclear plant: Biden, Macron, Scholz and Johnson urge restraintBerlin (AFP) – In a telephone call, US President Joe Biden, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged restraint around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in Ukraine. According to a spokesperson of Mr. Scholz, the leaders called for a mission of International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors to be dispatched â€œquicklyâ€ to the site. The resurgence of fighting around this nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine – with both sides blaming one another for the attacks – has the potential to cause a disaster worse than that of Chernobyl.On Friday, Macron said that Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to allow the IAEA to inspect the plant. As part of their talks on Sunday, the four Western leaders ""agreed that support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression will be maintainedâ€. (August 21)Before CETA: Scholz and Habeck want to strengthen economic relations with CanadaBerlin/Montreal (dpa) – With a three-day visit to Canada, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) and his Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck (Greens) aimed to significantly strengthen economic relations with the world's second-largest country. The focus was on energy and raw material supplies to Germany. However, the talks with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also centered around support for Ukraine, which is under attack from Russia, and on dealings with China.""We want to create a reliable network of industrial cooperation and use the advantages that Canada and Germany bring to the table. We need concrete action now.â€Olaf Scholz, German Chancellor in an interview with the newspaper Canadian Globe and Mail.The German business community is hoping that the ratification of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between the European Union and Canada by the German parliament, the Bundestag, will significantly boost trade relations. However, there is also strong criticism of the agreement. Over the weekend, a broad alliance of trade unions, environmentalists and human rights groups cautioned the Bundestag against approving CETA. According to them, the treaty unilaterally protects corporate interests and puts obstacles in the way of phasing-out fossil fuels, which is urgently required in light of the climate crisis.Parts of the trade agreement already came into force in 2017, but only in those areas for which the EU rather than its member states is solely responsible. The other parts are on hold until ratification is completed in all member states. The German government also wants to approve the CETA treaty. Ratification is planned for the fall. (August 21)Austrian government retains sanctions against RussiaKyiv/Moscow (APA) – In view of the debate in Austria on sanctions against Russia, the Austrian government reiterated on August 21 that its position in this regard remains unchanged. The sanctions were working, it said, and they were necessary to counter Russia's war of aggression on Ukraine, which was against international law. On Sunday, the oppositional party NEOS also cautioned that anyone who was questioning the sanctions was playing into Russia's hands. The ruling conservative Austrian People's Party (Ã–VP) and the opposition right-wing Freedom Party (FPÃ–) had recently been calling for a softening of the sanctions.The Upper Austrian governor Thomas Stelzer (Ã–VP) questioned the sanctions on Friday. They should be reconsidered if there are energy shortages in the fall, he said in the ""Krone"" and the ""Kleine Zeitung"" newspapers. Tyrol's Ã–VP chairman Anton Mattle, who is currently on the election campaign trail, also said he was ""open"" to the idea of reviewing the sanctions for ""effectivenessâ€. FPÃ– leader Herbert Kickl immediately called for a referendum on the issue.The Foreign Ministry attempted a balancing act in a statement on Sunday, explaining that the sanctions were ""a flexible tool"" and could be adjusted at any time. Therefore, the relevant EU Council decision on economic sanctions was also reviewed in Brussels every six months, the Ministry said. At the same time, the department reiterated the effectiveness of the sanctions. ""The sanctions are working – a little more each day. The Russian economy will shrink by at least six percent this year, and other forecasts even speak of up to ten percent. For the EU, on the other hand, the EU Commission expects growth of around 2.7 percent.â€""We want a rules-based world order, not the law of the jungle where the strongest can simply take what they want. We cannot and will not allow attempts to create facts and move borders with tanks and missiles in the 21st century.""Austriaâ€™s Foreign Ministry said in Vienna.Â ""Putin is counting on us, as pluralist open democracies, to let ourselves be divided, not to have the will to show him red lines. The EU's greatest strength is unity, and we must preserve that,"" the Foreign Ministry added. (August 21)Croatia announces aid for drought-stricken farmersZlatar Bistrica (HINA) – Due to the severe drought, Croatian Minister of Agriculture Marija VuÄkoviÄ‡ announced an extraordinary measure for farmers worth around 200 million HRK (over 26 million EUR) on August 21 in Zlatar Bistrica. Owing to the drought, Croatian farmers had already asked the ministry to issue a moratorium on exports. According to Minister VuÄkoviÄ‡, it has been decided to deviate from the rules for obtaining aid. This means that farmers will receive direct payment advances at the end of October or the beginning of November of this year.""Farmers' claims will get paid out in the areas where a natural disaster has been declared. Counties have already moved forward with declaring a natural disaster due to the extensive damage caused by the drought. Farmers won't have to fulfill certain criteria for damages, while still being eligible for support,"" explained VuÄkoviÄ‡.""All farmers who feel an increase in costs and a decrease in income, and who apply good agro-environmental practices – this is one of the basic conditions – will be able to benefit from this measure, which will be worth up to 15,000 EUR for them, as flat-rate support,"" she said. VuÄkoviÄ‡ added that the Ministry is considering other forms of assistance as well. (August 21)EU officials welcome end of enhanced economic surveillance for GreeceCopyright: EFE/Emma Pons Valls/ArchivoBrussels (EFE) – The European Union congratulated Greece for its ""commitment"" and ""determination"" to carry out the required economic and labor reforms, on the occasion of the end of the EU's close monitoring of the country on August 20. An important day for Greece, as it exits the enhanced surveillance framework. The countryâ€™s economic, fiscal and financial situation had been monitored since 2018, after the country had had three international bailouts. The termination of the surveillance was the result of the commitment of the Greek population and authorities, as well as European solidarity. Greece is moving forward, said Charles Michel, President of the European Council.Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni noted that the end of enhanced surveillance ""also marks the symbolic conclusion of the most difficult period the euro zone has ever experiencedâ€. In June 2018, the Eurogroup closed the third Greek bailout to put an end to eight years of unprecedented aid and reforms for Athens, the most visible face of the financial crisis in Europe. During the preceding eight years, Greece had undertaken profound reforms in its labor, tax, social security, pension, and public administration systems, carrying out privatizations, deep fiscal adjustments, and a reorganization of its banking sector, with great sacrifices of its population now recognized by Europe.

Historic moment: EU opened accession negotiations for North Macedonia and Albania,"For years, Albania and North Macedonia have been waiting to move closer to the EU. Now that an obstacle has been removed, things are set to move ahead quickly. In July, a historic moment was celebrated. Time for a recap.The European Union has begun the long-delayed accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania. The prime ministers of the two countries were welcomed for the first time to intergovernmental conferences in July in Brussels. These marked the start of the negotiation process.Macedonian head of government Dimitar KovaÄevski said that a dream his country had been having for three decades is now within reach. His Albanian counterpart Edi Rama commented that it is with joy and pride that Albania is now sitting at the big table of a united Europe to start membership negotiations. ""We know that this is not the beginning of the end. This is only the end of the beginning."" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and the German government described the move as historic. Von der Leyen stressed that North Macedonia and Albania had worked hard for this step.North Macedonia, which has a population of about 1.8 million according to the latest census, has been a candidate for EU accession since 2005, while Albania, with about 2.8 million citizens, has been a candidate since 2014. While Albania celebrated that the process is finally starting, the taste for North Macedonia is bittersweet: A sizeable part of the population and political forces deem the price for starting EU accession negotiations as being too high.What happened?North Macedonia was first blocked on its path into the EU by Greece over a name dispute. It accused its neighbour of appropriating Greek symbols since Greece has a region called Macedonia. This stalemate was eventually overcome with the Prespa agreement, signed by Athens and Skopje in the summer of 2018. It led to the renaming of the then Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to North Macedonia. Although the agreement opened the doors to NATO for North Macedonia, talks with the EU were a different story.The intergovernmental conferences (IGCs) to start accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania were actually supposed to be organized as early as 2020. However, the EU member state Bulgaria blocked the necessary decisions because of a dispute with North Macedonia. Among other things, the dispute concerned the interpretation of the partly shared history as well as the rights of ethnic Bulgarians in North Macedonia and the language. On July 17, both sides signed a protocol to settle the dispute.The solution came through a proposal by the French EU presidency, supported strongly by Albania whose negotiations talks were on hold as well, which led Sofia to drop its veto. The dispute, deeply rooted in history and cultural identity, strongly divided Macedonian society. What came to be known as the â€œFrench proposalâ€ in North Macedonia, included some of the main demands of Sofia, such as the introduction of a bilateral protocol in the EU negotiating framework, dealing with the â€œsharedâ€ history of both countries, as well as the inclusion of the Bulgarian minority in the Constitution of North Macedonia. But the most difficult issue was that of the Macedonian language, which Bulgaria considers to be a dialect of its own tongue. A key issue for Bulgaria was to protect the rights of the Bulgarian community in North Macedonia. The French proposal was initially rejected by the Macedonian government in June, but accepted by Bulgaria on June 24, 2022. To bring North Macedonia around, the French presidency worked out a number of amendments, most notably pertaining to the bilateral protocol and the language, which allowed the Macedonian government to accept the deal. This also unblocked Albaniaâ€™s path, which is tied to that of Skopje, at least at this stage. The modified negotiating framework doesnâ€™t explicitly mention the controversial bilateral protocol any more, and both countries may make a unilateral declaration regarding the language.The Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Dimitar KovaÄevski, declared on July 20 that â€œfinally, after 17 years the process of accepting North Macedonia into the big European family has started. We opened a new chapter, a European chapter that will bring quicker development, prosperity and stabilityâ€.North Macedonia: political challenges to changing the constitutionFreeing the path to EU negotiation talks undoubtedly poses a political challenge. The required constitutional amendments that would include the Bulgarian minority in the constitution, require a two-thirds majority in parliament. This cannot be done without the oppositionâ€™s votes.Hristijan Mickoski the leader of the biggest opposition party, the right-wing VMRO-DPMNE, said that the modified proposal still includes the same Bulgarian demands. â€œAccepting such a proposal means accepting Bulgariaâ€™s demands to change our school books,â€ he said, and added that the text also means that North Macedonia â€œaccepts that the Macedonian language is a dialect of Bulgarianâ€. The opposition staged numerous protests against the deal, some of which turned violent for days in July. Somewhere between the triumphant tone of the government and the doom and gloom of the opposition, some non-partisan voices, such as that of Dragan Tilev, long-time civil servant in the Secretariat for European Affairs, may be the most balanced. In an interview with MIA, Tilev declared:â€œItâ€™s evident from the conclusions of the Council and the statement of the EU officials that the negotiations will not proceed as long as the constitutional changes do not take place. It is a huge burden for our society and a big political challenge, which should not be allowed to simmer for long.â€Next stepsDuring the intergovernmental conferences in Brussels, the guidelines and principles for the negotiations were officially presented to the two candidate countries. On the basis of these, the EU Commission could now begin the so-called screenings. In this process, the authority examines the extent to which the candidate country's national law deviates from EU legislation and thus requires adaptation. Following the screenings, the Commission can then propose opening so-called negotiation chapters. For the recommendations to be implemented, a unanimous decision by the EU member states is required. Overall, the negotiation process can take many years and can also be stopped again if problems arise.North Macedonia must now amend its constitution to implement the agreements reached. Specifically, this involves the official recognition of Bulgarians as an ethnic minority group in North Macedonia.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Energy crisis still a huge challenge for European countries, von der Leyen stated that Europe will continue to stand by Ukraine's side in the long term","On the occasion of the Europe-wide Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted: Europe will continue to stand by Ukraine's side in the long term. Apart from that, half of Europe is affected by drought. Slovakian Prime Minister: Environmental Fund cannot solve the problem of surge in energy prices for companiesBratislava (TASR) - The Environmental Fund (EF) cannot solve the problem of the enormous increase in energy prices for companies, stated government chairman, Eduard Heger. This was in response to protests by workers of company Slovalco, who demonstrated in front of the Government Office of the Slovak Republic against the limitation of production due to high electricity prices on August 24. The EF is a financial program to subsidy Slovakian companies.""Today, the government does not have enough money to compensate companies for the purchase of electricity for their production. It also does not make economic sense. Even the entire budget of the Environmental Fund would not be suffice to cover the costs that would arise. This is an unprecedented situation,"" said the Prime Minister. According to him, the EF needs to be reformed. ""It should be remembered that the previous governments abused the EF to improve their budget results at the expense of the fund, which is considered one of the items of the state budget. Those items should be used purposefully and this did not happen,"" Heger explained. According to him, several solutions are prepared, which are being discussed. Parliament could vote on them in the fall. (August 25)Von der Leyen: Europe will continue to stand by Ukraineâ€™s side in the long termBrussels (dpa) – EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has promised Ukraine support for reconstruction on Ukraine's Independence Day. â€œTogether, we will rebuild the cities brick by brick and the gardens and fields seed by seed,â€ she said in a greeting message on August 24. Europe is on Ukraineâ€™s side today and for the long term. Von der Leyen also pointed out that in recent months, the EU has already done a great deal for the country and its citizens under attack from Russia. â€œOur schools have opened their doors to more than three million Ukrainian children, so they can continue to learn and study,â€ she said. There is also support for soldiers on the front, state employees and civil society.On the European Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes on August 23, Ursula von der Leyen has made serious allegations against Russian head of state Vladimir Putin. â€œPutin brought the horrors of war back to Europe this year and reminded us that peace cannot be taken for granted,â€ wrote the German politician. Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine was illegal and unjustified, she added. State-controlled propaganda also distorted history and spread conspiracy theories. Anyone who opposed it was punished. Von der Leyen assured that the EU would not rest until Ukraine prevailed.â€œCitizens of Ukraine give their lives to protect the values on which our Union is founded.â€EU Commission President Ursula von der LeyenThe Europe-wide Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes has been celebrated on August 23 since 2009. This is also a reminder of the so-called Hitler-Stalin Pact. The German-Soviet non-aggression treaty signed on August 23, 1939 is considered to have paved the way for the German invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. (August 22/24)Kiev: Hungary and Austria only EU countries that have not supplied any weapons so farKiev (APA) – According to Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Austria and Hungary are the only European countries that have not yet supplied Ukraine with weapons in the fight against the Russian attackers. According to agency Ukrinform, Kuleba said this on Ukrainian television on August 22:â€œExcept for Hungary and Austria, which is a neutral country, the supply of weapons to Ukraine is not taboo for any European country, although that was the case in the past.â€said Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro KulebaMany countries that had never supplied weapons to conflict areas before had changed their minds â€œafter the start of total aggressionâ€. According to Kuleba, some countries had changed their laws to allow for arms supplies to Ukraine. When it comes to the supply pf weapons, there are always discussions among Ukraineâ€™s Western partners as to which weapons should be supplied and at which time. These discussions cost Ukraine daily losses at the front, complained the Foreign Minister.Russia launched its war of aggression on Ukraine half a year ago. Because of its neutral stance within the EUâ€™s Ukraine policy, Austria sees itself in a â€œspecial roleâ€, as Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Ã–VP) has put it. He asserted at the beginning of July that Austria was â€œin full solidarityâ€ with the European Union, including on security issues. During a visit to Kiev in July, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Ã–VP) personally told the Ukrainian leadership that Austria, as a neutral country, could not supply weapons to Ukraine.Hungary, on the other hand, is a NATO member. The course of Hungary's long-standing Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, who wants to establish an â€œilliberal democracyâ€ in Hungary, has led to several EU infringement proceedings. OrbÃ¡n also maintains good contacts with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Hungary already defied EU sanctions against Russia in the past. OrbÃ¡n wants to stay out of the Ukraine war, and, according to him, anyone who supplies weapons already has â€œone foot in the warâ€. (August 23)Budapest sent response regarding conditionality mechanism to the European Commission Budapest/Brussels (ANSA) – One day before deadline expired, the Hungarian government sent a letter to the European Commission in which it proposes solutions to resolve the dispute over the rule of law under the conditionality mechanism. This is crucial for Budapestâ€™s access to European funds. The Commissionâ€™s last letter, a month ago, argued that the previous responses, provided by the government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban, had been unsatisfactory. These had been given with regard to concerns about the public procurement system, the independence of the prosecutorâ€™s office and judges and the fight against corruption.â€œThe reply was preceded by intensive consultations. The Hungarian Government has put a comprehensive package of measures on the table to address all the Commission's concerns. The Hungarian Government remains open to a constructive dialogue with the Commission,â€ Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga wrote on Facebook. The conditionality mechanism, activated for the first time against Hungary last April, provides for the suspension of European funds allocated to a member state, when alleged breaches in the rule of law have or threaten to have an impact on the EUâ€™s finances.â€œWe now have a month to analyze the document and provide a response,â€ said a spokesman for the European Executive, noting that it would be â€œprematureâ€ to make a judgment on the content of the document at the moment. â€œWe will not hesitate to contact the Hungarian authorities if there is a need for further clarification,â€ the spokesman noted, adding that the conditionality mechanism was a separate matter – with different procedures – from the ongoing dialogue with Hungary for the disbursement of Recovery Plan funds. According to analysts, the Hungarian response contains only intentions and promises and few concrete measures, and the Commission will most likely start sanctions proceedings, which will have to be approved by a qualified majority of the Council. (August 23)JRCreport: Almost half of Europe affected by drought, Slovenia among the hardest hitBrussels (STA) - Nearly half of Europe is affected by drought, warns a report published on August 22 by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the European Commissionâ€™s scientific service. Among the worst affected countries and regions where drought will significantly reduce crop yields, the report mentions Slovenia.The countries or regions worst affected by the drought are Spain, France, central and northern Italy, central Germany, Hungary, Romania, Slovenia and Croatia. These areas have been experiencing a lack of rain for a long time. In addition, high temperatures or heat waves prevailed during the flowering and ripening of crops, resulting in a decrease in harvests. The JRC staetd that corn, soybean and sunflower harvests will be particularly affected.The Slovenian government has already offered farmers the opportunity to claim drought damages due to force majeure if they do not meet the conditions for receiving support set out by agricultural policy measures. Assessments of damage to agricultural crops as a result of this yearâ€™s severe drought are already underway and are expected to be completed by September 30.

"Interviewee makes false claims about warming, CO2, climate models","A British television interview viewed tens of thousands of times on social media features a man claiming that global warming is natural, CO2 has no provable effect on the climate, the greenhouse effect is negligible, and computer models used to measure climate change are skewed. But the speaker is not a climate specialist, experts say the claims are false, and world scientists overwhelmingly agree that humans are heating the planet by burning fossil fuels.The interview with Brian Catt, introduced as a ""physicist and electrical engineer and an MBA"", was broadcast on the channel TalkTV and posted on its Facebook page on August 14, 2022. It was widely shared on Facebook and Twitter.Asked whether people are ""right to panic"" about climate change, Catt replied: ""They should relax basically, simply because if they were to go and look at the natural history of the Earth, which has all been unravelled since these climate myths were created by the UN, they'd find that actually what is happening now is almost totally normal.""In the eight-minute excerpt of the interview, Catt makes several further unfounded claims about global climate change. Climate specialists interviewed by AFP explained why the claims are false. Their responses are detailed below.Screenshot taken on August 22, 2022 of a Facebook post featuring a TalkTV interviewCatt's LinkedIn profile says he took a degree in physics in 1971 and later studied business. An article published on August 24 on the investigative climate website DeSmog detailed some of Catt's activities, including a blog post he published accusing the United Nations and green campaigners of using ""Nazi"" methods to impose a ""Marxist dystopia"".A search on Google Scholar showed that Catt has submitted papers to SSRN, a publisher of ""pre-print"" studies that have not yet been accredited through the regular process of scientific peer-review.""He doesn't have any qualifications or a scientific publication record in this area and he's essentially rejecting the expert conclusion of every credible scientific organisation around the world,"" said Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics.Current climate change not part of normal cyclesCatt said global temperatures have risen and fallen over millennia and the heating of the planet in recent decades is not due to human causes, stating at one point that ""CO2 has no provable effect on the climate.""""For the last 10,000 years, which is a short warm period within an ice-age cycle, it goes up and down about a degree at the equator, two degrees at the poles, about every thousand years and it's perfectly normal and the rates of rise now ... is not unusual either,"" he said.Ward and Ed Hawkins, a professor of climate science at the University of Reading, said that temperature fluctuations comparable to the current warming have not happened on that timescale during the past 10,000 years.""Global temperatures have oscillated over a large range in the past but those changes take tens of thousands of years to happen. We understand there are natural causes for those cycles, due to Earth's orbit around the sun. Climate scientists have studied this for centuries,"" Hawkins said.""What we see over the last 2,000 years is a very gentle decline, then suddenly at the end you see a rapid uptick in temperature, way above anything we've seen in the last 2,000 years,"" he added.""The claim that that is normal is simply not true -- it is very abnormal when we look back over the global records, way outside anything we've seen over the past 2,000 years in terms of the rapidity and the spatial coherence,"" of the rise.TheÂ UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeÂ (IPCC) sums up the trend in a chart at the start of its majorÂ reportÂ in August 2021.The left-hand chart shows temperatures rising sharply in the past 150 years. On the right-hand chart, the blue line at the bottom shows how much lower global temperatures would be without the impact of humans releasing CO2 and other greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels:Chart shows human-made emissions warm planet. Left: surge in warming since 1850. Right: warming would be less without human-made emissions ( IPCC / Sixth Assessment Report)The claim that recent warming is normal because temperatures have been seen to rise and fall over millennia ""is just stupid logic,"" said Mike Lockwood, professor of space environment physics, also at the University of Reading.""It is of course true that temperatures have risen and fallen in the past but that is not a reason for assuming that the present change has the same causes as past ones.""The IPCC reviews studies to summarise the state of knowledge about how humans are driving climate change, using reports compiled by hundreds of scientists in dozens of countries. In the first part of its latest major report in 2021 it said: ""It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land.""Sun doesn't cause global warmingScientists agree that carbon emissions from humans burning fossil fuels have increased the greenhouse effect, driving up the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that traps heat near the Earth's surface.Catt downplayed the greenhouse effect and said other factors were causing global warming. ""It's a very small effect, the greenhouse effect, within the overall parameters of the atmosphere. There are much bigger things at work like the sun shining on it and the gravity pulling the atmosphere onto the ground ... the clouds are the control of Earth's climate stability,"" he said.Scientists responded by citing well-documented findings that show the Sun's variations have not been strong enough to change the Earth's climate.Lockwood said solar activity rose in the 1950s-1960s and fell back again in 2008-2019 even as the rise in global temperatures accelerated. ""This shows how very minor all solar effects are compared to the real causes of global temperature rise,"" he said.He provided the following charts, drawn from the UK Met Office's HadCRUT climate data series. The top two curves show global temperatures (top) and CO2 concentration (second from top) rising since the 1960s, while the number of sunspots -- indicators of solar energy (third chart) -- and total solar irradiance (bottom chart) have declined overall:Charts based on Met Office data show global temperatures and CO2 levels rising even as sunspots and solar irradiance fell ( Mike Lockwood / University of Reading)Hawkins said: ""We have good records of direct measurements of the amount of energy from the Sun from satellites and sun-spot numbers going back a very long way, so we understand variations in the Sun's output. The Sun has a roughly 11-year cycle. We don't see a big 11-year change in climate, so that can't be having a big impact.""He said what is known is ""that the Sun's got slightly less bright over the past 50 years, which is when we've seen the most rapid warming.""The US space agency NASA sums up the impact of solar irradiance on the Earth's climate here. ""The Sun's energy output only changes by up to 0.15% over the course of the cycle, less than what would be needed to force the change in climate that we see,"" it says.""If the Sun were driving Earth's warming, one would expect to see that upper atmosphere getting increasingly hot,"" it adds. ""Instead, measurements show the lower atmosphere is getting hotter, while the upper atmosphere is getting cooler.""The conclusion is echoed in a summary by the World Meteorological Association. ""The rise in temperatures -- which are melting ice and heating the oceans -- is driven by long-lived greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,"" it says.The confirmation that warming at Earth's surface is due to increased levels of CO2 came from a model developed by Japanese-US climatologist Syukuro Manabe. He won the Nobel Physics Prize in 2021 for the model:Graphic on the winners of the Nobel Prize in Physics 2021 and research on climate models ( AFP / Gal ROMA, Sophie RAMIS)Regarding the comment on gravity, scientists consulted by AFP said it was not clear what Catt meant.""Does he mean Milankovich orbital cycles?"" Lockwood said, referring to variations in the Earth's orbital movements. ""Their effect is well known and understood. Changes are very slow compared to recent climate change.""Ward also said he was unsure about the gravity comment. ""If gravity is pulling the atmosphere closer then we should be able to measure that and it would already be having an effect on us as people,"" he said.As for clouds, the scientists said they do not drive climate change.""Clouds are part of the climate system and not an external influence,"" said Lockwood.Hawkins said that current models account for small changes to the properties of clouds. ""They have an impact but it's factored in.""Climate models take natural variables into accountAt the end of the clip Catt criticised the computer models used by climatologists to measure and forecast the impact of human-driven global warming. (Some users shared a shorter excerpt from the interview which did not include these claims.)""The initial statement is CO2 causes the problem, when in fact it probably doesn't. So what they do is, they quietly skip around that, ignore the fact that climate changes naturally, feed into their models a causal relationship between carbon dioxide,"" he said.The scientists interviewed denied that the models are skewed in this way. Hawkins said the natural factors mentioned have long been known about and factored in to calculations.""The models are millions of lines of code in some cases. We encode in a computer all of our understanding of the physics, chemistry and biology of the atmosphere, the oceans and the land. This is the same basis as that of weather forecast models, which most people recognise represent the atmosphere very accurately,"" he said.""But the fact that CO2 absorbs infrared radiation is something you can measure in a school laboratory. If you change the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the planet's temperature will change.""How human activity disrupts the carbon cycle ( AFP / ElÃ©onore HUGHES, Sophie RAMIS)Lockwood said the whole point of models was to control for variables such as the natural factors mentioned.""Detection-attribution techniques use climate models to identify the relative contributions of anthropogenic and natural causes,"" he said. ""They can only do this specifically because the models predict and allow for both anthropogenic and natural effects. The idea that the latter are ignored is laughable.""Catt claimed that many of the studies citing forecasts based on climate models were ""not reproducible"" for purposes of scientific scrutiny.""People make up these things, feed them into models and say we proved them because the model says so,"" he said. ""The climate models on average are producing... 250 percent error in the amount of warming they predict.""He did not cite a source for the figure.Ward of the Grantham Research Institute said the models have a long history and are repeatedly reviewed by scientists.""The models are tested by their ability to reproduce recent trends in climate and those that are successful are the ones that end up being used to make projections of the future,"" he said.""You wouldn't trust a car or a bridge or a building that had been designed without the use of a computer model. If any engineer tried to build anything nowadays without using a model, he'd be laughed out of town.""Regarding Catt's claim, he added: ""The only way he can get away with it is if he claims there's a global conspiracy between hundreds of thousands of scientists who all know that these models are flawed but are refusing to say anything about it -- and that is just silly.""The Met Office published a description of its HadGEM3 climate model in a research article here.Political climateCatt was interviewed on air by Richard Tice, a former member of the European Parliament and leader of the right-wing party Reform UK, formerly the Brexit Party.Ward judged that coverage on TalkTV was ""politically driven"", addressing an audience of ""hardcore climate sceptics who think that net-zero [climate targets policy] is to blame for the energy crisis"".He identified Catt as a regular commentator in climate-denial circles and media. Investigative site Desmog reported that Catt had been quoted by the British climate science denial group CAR26, which the site says has links to the right-wing Reclaim Party.Tice also referred in passing to recent claims of ""good news that the Great Barrier Reef"" has ""record levels of coral cover"".

"Europe in brief: Serbia wants to cancel EuroPride, European judges sue Council over Polish recovery plan and Spanish Prime Minister Sanchez visits Germany","Organizers do not want to accept the cancellation of the international festival EuroPride, which is hosted by a different European city each year and was scheduled to take place in Belgrade this September. Also this week: Spanish Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez visits Germany to promote the Midcat gas pipeline connecting Spain and France to alleviate the EU's supply problems.
Serbia: Disagreements about holding EuroPride in BelgradeBelgrade/Brussels (Tanjug) – The Serbian Government believes that safe conditions cannot be guaranteed at the moment to hold the festival EuroPride 2022, which was supposed to take place in Belgrade in mid-September. According to the president of the European Association of Pride Organizers, Kristine Garina, EuroPride in Belgrade would bring together thousands of LGBTI+ people from all over Europe, Serbia and the wider Western Balkan region. Garina also said that EuroPride will not be canceled, and any attempt to ban it would be a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which Serbia ratified as a member of the Council of Europe.According to the Serbian government, some extremist groups could ""use and abuse this event in order to increase tensions and bring instability to Serbiaâ€. In an announcement, the government stated that at this point in time, no safe conditions could be guaranteed to hold EuroPride 2022 â€œin light of the current political situation in the region, the daily tensions, the safety of all citizens of our country and public orderâ€.""EuroPride is not canceled, and will not be canceled. During the bidding process for EuroPride 2022, Serbian Prime Minister Ana BrnabiÄ‡ promised the full support of the Serbian government for EuroPride in Belgrade, and we expect that promise to be honored,"" Garina stated. BrnabiÄ‡ said that the position of the organizers of Pride ""is in accordance with the Constitution"", but also warned of possible consequences regarding safety and security. (August 29)European judges want to tackle EUâ€™s Polish recovery plan approvalBrussels (Belga) – On August 28, four European judges' associations went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg seeking to cancel the approval of the Polish recovery plan. The EU member states gave green light to the plan in June, despite ongoing concerns about the independence of the Polish judiciary.The conditions imposed on Poland by the EU for the payment of European subsidies â€œfall short of what is required to ensure effective protection of the independence of judges and the judiciary and disregard the judgments of the CJEU on the matter,â€ the four associations wrote in a statement. The Association of European Administrative Judges (AEAJ), the European Association of Judges (EAJ), Judges for Judges and Magistrats EuropÃ©ens pour la DÃ©mocratie et les LibertÃ©s (MEDEL) ask the Court to set aside the decision of the member states and prevent the release of funds.Following a proposal by the European Commission, the European Finance Ministers approved the Polish plan in June. It offers Warsaw the prospect of 35.4 billion euros in EU funds to support the economic recovery after the coronavirus pandemic. In return, the other member states demanded that the conservative government in Poland mitigated a number of lingering problems related to the independence of the judiciary. (August 28)Serbia and Kosovo conclude â€œfree movement agreementâ€ to defuse tensionsBrussels (AFP) – According to Josep Borrell, the head of European diplomacy, Serbia and Kosovo reached â€œan agreement on free movementâ€ between the two countries on August 27, following renewed tensions over border and administrative regulations imposed by Pristina. The agreement does not resolve the issue of license plates of cars belonging to Serbs living in Kosovo. Pristinaâ€™s demand to have them exchanged for Kosovan plates had led to an outbreak of violence in July.After EU-led negotiations, Pristina agreed not to introduce entry/exit documents for people entering Kosovo with a Serbian identity card from September 1, Borrell announced on Twitter, asserting that he had received ""guarantees"" from Kosovo's prime minister. In return, Belgrade agreed to abolish entry/exit documents for visitors to Serbia with a Kosovan identity card.

(August 25)Spanish Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez: If there is no gas pipeline between Spain and France, there will be interconnection through ItalySpanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Copyright: EFE/Olivier HosletBogotÃ¡/Santander (EFE) – The head of the Spanish government, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, showed his â€œdeterminationâ€ to push ahead with the energy interconnection project between Spain and the rest of the EU through the Pyrenees. He warned France that the interconnection will pass through Italy, if France opposes it. On August 30, SÃ¡nchez met with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany. The two heads of state have a common interest to promote this gas interconnection. SÃ¡nchez will also try to convince French President Emmanuel Macron to overcome his reservations.At a press conference in BogotÃ¡, SÃ¡nchez recalled that the European Commission already recognizes this connection as a priority in its energy plans. He also thanked Scholz for his interest in promoting it. However, he warned that if France maintained its rejection, the Commission had a plan B: an energy interconnection between Spain and Italy. SÃ¡nchez acknowledged that while France did unlock some electricity connections, this did not extend to gas. He urges Macron not to be a bottleneck, so that the IIberian Peninsula no longer remains an energy island and may contribute to Europeâ€™s response to Russian President Vladimir Putinâ€™s â€œenergy blackmailâ€.For his part, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell said in an interview with Efe that the Midcat gas pipeline between Spain and France would help alleviate the EU's supply problem. He advocated starting construction as soon as possible. ""We have to think not only about what that gas pipeline might transport now, but what it can transport in the future. I wish we had done it sooner, but it is better to start today than tomorrow,"" he said. (August 24 and 25)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Von der Leyen defends intervention in the European electricity market, German Chancellor wants to strengthen Europe with reforms","Europe in brief: The electricity market and inflation in Europe, the training mission for the Ukrainian forces, the nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhya  and the nuclear agreement with Iran are some of the issues that have dominated European news in the last few days. Also this week: German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wants to make the European Union fit for enlargement by strengthening it with far-reaching reforms.Brussels/Madrid/Meseberg (Europapress) – The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has defended the need to reform the electricity market in Europe, arguing that it was designed ""for different circumstances"" and, by linking the price of gas to that of other energies, has now created the ""exorbitant"" prices which have to be paid on the continent in the context of the war in Ukraine.At the Bled Strategic Summit in Slovenia, Von der Leyen called for cutting all energy dependence on Russia to end ""blackmail"", and urged a commitment to green transition and renewable energies.""The era of Russian fossil fuels in Europe is over,â€said the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.Meanwhile, Spain's Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez and Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz have staged a joint effort to advance the Midcat project, a pipeline to carry gas from the Iberian Peninsula to the rest of Europe. France, after its initial reluctance, now considers examining this option (August 29-30).Romania to boost production of batteries and photovoltaic panelsBucharest (Agerpres) – The Romanian Ministry of Energy has released for public consultation the documents regarding access to European funds from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) for the production of batteries, photovoltaic panels and storage capacities, announced the responsible minister, Virgil Popescu.According to Popescu, the industrial value chain for batteries will allow for a total annual battery manufacturing and assembly capacity of at least 2 GW. Meanwhile, the industrial value chain for photovoltaic cells and panels will extend to a total annual capacity of at least 200 MW by December 31, 2025.Eligible applicants are small, medium and large enterprises, whose articles of association include activities related to the production and sale of electricity. The allocated budget amounts to EUR 104 million composed of Â EUR 80 million in non-reimbursable funds provided by the RRF (Recovery and Resilience Facility) and national funds in the amount of EUR 24 million. The aid is grantedÂ  in the form of reimbursement of expenses incurred and cannot exceed EUR 167,000 per MWh of storage and EUR 15 million per enterprise and investment project. (August 30)BSF: The EU does not need a new enlargement strategy for the Western BalkansBled (STA) – The EU does not need a new enlargement strategy for the Western Balkans, but the existing one needs to be implemented, said Miroslav LajÄak, the EU representative for the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo. He stated this in a panel dedicated to EU enlargement to the Western Balkans, held within the framework of the Bled Strategic Forum. As LajÄak asserted, the EU is ready for new enlargement.Christian Schmidt, High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), said that the EU must do everything to speed up the integration of the countries of the Western Balkans. There was no alternative to the European integration of these countries, but there was no need for two parallel expansions with the countries of the Western Balkans, or a two-speed Balkan, said the American envoy for the Western Balkans, Gabriel Escobar. He also stated that all the governments of the Western Balkan countries should do their homework when approaching European integration, and that in BiH all three main parties had failed in this regard. With the war in Ukraine, the economic and food crisis, the chances of BiH getting candidate status are diminishing, according to Minister of Foreign Affairs Bisera TurkoviÄ‡. She raised the question of whether the EU is really ready to help BiH on its way towards accession, or whether this is just part of the political game, as many in BiH see it. The Foreign Minister of North Macedonia, Bujar Osmani, believes that the EU maintained its credibility at the last minute when it started membership negotiations with North Macedonia in July. (August 30)Austria currently rules out participation in EU training mission for UkrainePrague (APA) – Austrian Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner is currently ruling out Austriaâ€™s participation in an EU training mission for the Ukrainian military. â€œI donâ€™t see any way to be there at this point in time,â€ Tanner said on August 30 after an informal meeting with her EU counterparts in Prague. She emphasized that â€œlegal and local issuesâ€ as well as content-related questions needed to be clarified.â€œIt is beyond question that we naturally have limits here, given the state of war,â€ Tanner answered in response to a question about neutrality. According to the Minister of Defence, a so-called fact-finding mission will first create a concept within one month. Once all questions have been clarified, Austria will assess â€œhow to deal with the issueâ€. Tanner also referred to the question of locality. According to the Treaty of the European Union, the envisaged EU training mission would have to take place outside European Union territory and require a unanimous vote of consent from all EU member states. Austria could once again â€œconstructively abstainâ€ due to its neutrality, confirmed Tanner. (August 30)German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wants to strengthen Europe with reformsPrague (dpa) – With far-reaching reforms, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz wants to strengthen the European Union and make it fit for enlargement. In his keynote speech at Charles University in Prague on August 29, Scholz advocated simplified decision-making processes, a crisis-proof asylum system and closer cooperation in the areas of armaments and defence. Scholz specifically announced that he wanted to set up a new air defence system together with European neighbours.â€œWe must bring the weight of a united Europe to bear much more. (â€¦) Together, we have the very best chance of helping to shape the 21st century in a European sense,â€ said Olaf Scholz during his visit to the Czech Republic. The chancellor stressed that the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine had welded the EU together. Scholz supported the French idea for a new European political community, which should enable closer exchange with partners from outside the European Union. There is currently no forum at which EU heads of state and government could discuss key topics with partner states once or twice a year – for example on issues such as security, energy or climate protection. The idea for such a community came from French President Emmanuel Macron.â€œSuch a forum – this is very important to me – is no alternative to the upcoming EU enlargement,â€ emphasized the Chancellor. â€œWe have made promises to our candidate countries – the countries of the Western Balkans – for almost 20 years.â€ Scholz campaigned for closer cooperation in the defence sector. He argued that a common air defence system would be less expensive and more powerful than national solutions. He cited the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, the Baltic States and the Scandinavian countries as potential partners for this. Scholz also called for an independent Council of EU Defence Ministers. The chancellor emphasized his support for an EU enlargement to include the states of the Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and, in the future, Georgia.â€œThe fact that the EU continues to grow eastward is a gain for all of us,â€says German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.In order to make the EU fit for this, he wants, among other things, to change the composition of the EU Parliament. If you didnâ€™t want to inflate the parliament, then it needed â€œa new balance in terms of its compositionâ€, demanded Scholz. â€œAnd this is also in compliance with the democratic principle, according to which every vote should have roughly the same weight.â€ Countries with smaller populations are disproportionately represented in the EU Parliament compared to countries with large populations such as Germany.

Press freedom in Europe: 'A worrying alarm signal',"While the proposal on the Media Freedom Act is set to be presented by the European Commission on September 13, press freedom remains under pressure in several countries across Europe.  For the first time, the Media Pluralism Monitor, which assesses the risks to media freedom and pluralism in the EU and is part of the annual European Commissionâ€™s Rule of Law Report, has introduced an overall ranking of member states. This was clustered into five levels of risk, and Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Malta, Poland, Romania and Slovenia have been identified as countries at â€œhigh riskâ€. In public service outlets in those countries, editorial and governance independence need to be strengthened. Presenting the European Commission's Rule of Law Report in July, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, the European Commissionâ€™s vice president responsible for values and transparency, said it was the developments in Slovenia that prompted the Commission to consider a Media Freedom Act that would apply to all EU member states.â€œThe report shows that there are deficiencies regarding the protection of journalists, the independence of public media and regulators as well as media pluralism (...). This is a worrying alarm signal,â€ said Maja Sever, president of the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ). Furthermore, she urged the EU Commission â€œto adopt a strong Media Freedom Act, which would concretely strengthen the protection of journalists and the independence of the media. (...) It should also impose more transparency and full respect for editorial autonomy on the media industryâ€.EUâ€™s upcoming Media Freedom Act – what to expect? The European Media Freedom Act (EMFA) is expected to be presented in mid-September by the EU Commission, while an anti-SLAPP directive was proposed in April. Strategic lawsuits against public participation – commonly known as 'SLAPPs' – are lawsuits filed against journalists, media outlets, and activists. They are regarded as a particular form of harassment against journalists, as the lawsuits typically drag on for years and hence require huge amounts of money and time from the defendant. This phenomenon has been gaining ground in the EU. The EU Commission intends to create effective safeguards in order to prevent such harassment from silencing journalists. According to the EU Commission, alleged defamation is one of the most common reasons why SLAPPs are filed against journalists. Various press freedom organizations have high expectations for the proposal on EMFA. According to the Commission, the proposal will focus on eliminating barriers to the establishment and operation of media services. In particular, it aims to complement the recommendation on the protection, safety, and empowerment of journalists, the recently adopted Digital Services Act and the anti-SLAPP initiative to protect journalists and rights defenders from abusive litigation. But what is the situation in the member states?Media in Slovenia face major challenges The Slovenian media has been facing problems for years. Apart from the rather shallow market, Slovenian media had to stem the economic and social transition. They have to deal with a lack of transparent and strategically oriented media ownership, underfunding, faulty regulation and interference in the autonomy and independence of journalists.The suspension of statutory state funding of the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) in 2020 and 2021, attempts to change media legislation and efforts to undermine the credibility of public media and subjugate them to ruling politics under the Janez JanÅ¡a government lead to concerns by Slovenian and international journalistic associations and the European Commission.The Commission expressed concerns about media freedom not being respected and issued warnings that Slovenia could follow in the footsteps of Hungary, partly because Budapest was involved in the financing of some of the media with close ties to Janez JanÅ¡a's Democratic Party (SDS).Taking over in June, the Robert Golob government pledged to overhaul media legislation. It has drawn up a bill aimed to depoliticize the public broadcaster RTV Slovenija and boost its independence, but the SDS party has filed for a referendum on the bill, meaning it cannot enter into force for the time being.Additional strain has been put on the public broadcaster since May of this year by a strike organized by journalists' trade unions. They demand journalistic autonomy, alleging political pressure and interference in staffing and editorial decisions by the leadership appointed under the previous government and the new director of Televizija Slovenija, who was appointed after the April elections.The public in Slovenia is losing trust in the media. A survey conducted by pollster Valicon in April showed that the public broadcaster saw the biggest decline in trust among all institutions that experienced a  downward trend,  and that overall trust in the media was decreasing.Italy's fall in rankingsIn neighboring Italy, the situation is volatile as well. The country has dropped by 17 places in the annual worldwide ranking of press freedom conducted by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), plummeting to the 58th rank out of 180. Following a landmark 2021 constitutional court ruling, prison sentences for libel have been largely abolished. Of concern, however, is the increasing prevalence of SLAPP suits and the rise in  criminal and civil prosecution of alleged defamation.Croatia: nearly 1,000 SLAPPs against journalists and media outletsCroatiaâ€™s media scene has become diverse and dynamic, but the government is failing to protect journalists against legal attempts to muzzle them. According to RSF, the government itself represents a threat to press freedom in Croatia. Half a dozen national newspapers appear each day, but their ownership is concentrated. Two media companies, Styria and Hanza Media, control three-quarters of the market. The two major private television networks, Nova TVZ and RTL, provide nationwide coverage and compete with publicly owned HTV, whereas most radio stations only have a regional reach.Working as a journalist in Croatia can sometimes be hazardous. Reporters investigating corruption, organized and war crimes, especially at the local level, are often hit by harassment campaigns. Physical assaults, threats and cyber violence are a major problem. The authorities remain silent. Government interference in the management of HTV persists, the RSF say.Defamation is a criminal offense in Croatia and is regularly invoked by politicians and business people to discourage journalistsâ€™ questions about their activities. In addition, insulting ""the Republic, its emblem, its national anthem or its flag"" is punishable by up to three years in prison. Even more serious, comments deemed ""humiliating"" are criminalized. Gag-order lawsuits (SLAPPs) remain a scourge. The RSFâ€™s report states that nearly one thousand legal actions against journalists or media organizations are pending.According to the Freedom House report for 2022, the media in Croatia is highly polarized. Journalists continue to face threats, harassment, and occasional attacks, which has created an atmosphere of self-censorship. Croatia ranks 48th on the 2022 World Press Freedom Index published on May 2 by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). This is an improvement compared to 2021, when the country ranked 56th.The situation of press freedom in non-EU countries Citizens in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) trust media and religious institutions the most, whereas they trust politicians and political parties the least. These are the results of the study  â€œMedia freedom in BiH in 2022â€, jointly conducted by the association BH Journalists and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.Although more than 80 percent of people in Bosnia and Herzegovina said they trust the media, many of them believe that political parties and politicians exert a great influence: Two-thirds of respondents believe that political and financial dependence is the main obstacle to media and press freedom.According to journalists' associations, media laws in BiH are relatively good, but many media outlets, especially local ones, are financially dependent on political or economic power centers. The advertising industry is among the smallest in Europe, and media literacy is low. On the other hand, defamation has been decriminalized, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on media freedom in BiH.North Macedonia: widespread misinformation remains a threat Compared to last year, North Macedonia has climbed 33 places in the Reporters Without Bordersâ€™ media freedom rankings. The country ranked 57th out of 180 countries in 2022, whereas it held place 90 in the 2021 rankings.According to the report, although journalists in North Macedonia do not work in a hostile environment, ""widespread misinformation and lack of professionalism contribute to society's declining trust in the media, which exposes independent outlets to threats and attacksâ€.Regarding the media in a political context, the report notes that transparency of institutions is poor, and due to strong political polarization, the media can be subjected to pressure by authorities, politicians and businessmen. The two largest political parties, the report highlights, have created parallel media systems, through which they exert their political and economic influence. The report points out that judicial abuse of the Law on Civil Responsibility for Defamation incites self-censorship in the media. â€œLawsuits are used as a tool for intimidation and pressure on independent media,â€ the report says.â€œAlthough certain types of media concentration are prohibited by law, the editorial staff of some of the major TV channels are exposed to economic pressures from their owners. State funding is limited and non-transparent, and independent media rely heavily on donors.â€EU member states passive on the deterioration in media freedomOverall, defamation and self-censorship pose a threat to media freedom and freedom of expression in Europe. Counteracting the deterioration of press freedom and media pluralism continues to be a challenge. EFJ President Maja Sever urged that â€œtoo many EU member states remain passive in the face of deteriorating working conditions for journalists and the decline of press freedom.â€ It remains to be seen how the pending Media Freedom Act will affect this.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Brussels wants to protect the EU internal market in the event of a crisis and is preparing for a possible complete stop of Russian gas supplies,"The EU plans to require manufacturers to give priority to European bids, rather than Chinese or American ones. Also important this week: Brussels is close to adopting a price cap that could affect the purchases of Russian methane while the Albanian government decided to subsidize the production of wheat in the country.EU Commissioner Gentiloni: ""The EU is ready to react"" Brussels (ANSA) – The EU is preparing for a possible complete stop of Russian gas supplies. It is also close to adopting a price cap that could affect not only the purchases of Russian methane but also the price of electricity. Talks at a technical and political level, also requested by the Italian President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella, are already scheduled for next week. â€œWe expect Russia to respect existing contractsâ€, said the EU Economic Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni after Russian energy giant Gazprom announced an indefinite stop to the gas flow through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline which has intensified the crisis. But even if Moscowâ€™s â€œuse of energy as a weaponâ€ should continue, â€œthe EU is ready to reactâ€, Gentiloni added. He also touched on the question of the price cap. â€œThe wall of divisions between the different countries is beginning to show breachesâ€, he said in an indication that the renewed proposal by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen of a gas price cap could move forward. â€œThis would be a really big breakthrough,â€ said Gentiloni.What is certain is that swift decisions are needed despite Gazpromâ€™s assurances that supplies to Europe will be guaranteed at least in part through pipelines other than Nord Stream 1. The President of the European Council, Charles Michel, also demanded faster decision-making. He criticized von der Leyen for not yet having fully lived up to the demands of European leaders who had asked her to prepare joint purchasing, gas price caps and relief for households and businesses facing surging energy bills. (September 3)Subsidies to increase wheat production in AlbaniaTirana (ATA) – Due to the war in Ukraine, the Albanian government decided to subsidize the production of wheat in the country. A fund of 500 million Albanian Lek (ALL) (4.2 million Euro) is being made available to wheat growers to enable them to increase their output. This decision taken in late July is Albaniaâ€™s answer to the development of the grain price and the imposition of a ban on its export from many countries after the Russian invasion of Ukraine.Through this measure, the minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Frida Krifca, said wheat growers farmland exceeding 1 hectare – which account for the lionâ€™s share of the market – will receive support of 30,000 ALL (255 Euro) per hectare. The subsidy will be paid to 7,300 farmers and the aim is to increase the area cultivated with wheat by 17,000 hectares to 70,000 hectares in the coming year. The government intends to double the production of grain in the country produced for trading from 60,000 tons to 120,000 tons. â€œThis yearâ€™s production of wheat has been reached a record high of approximately 225,000 tons of grain, or half the amount we consumeâ€, underlined the Minister. (September 2)Brussels wants to be able to force companies to serve the EU firstBrussels (AFP) – Brussels is expected to present a draft of a new instrument in mid-September to protect the EUâ€™s internal market in the event of a crisis. It includes forcing manufacturers of strategic goods to prioritize the European market if necessary.In the event of a critical shortage, the EU Commission would have the power to require manufacturers to give priority to European bids, rather than Chinese or American ones, under penalty of fines, according to a document seen on Friday by AFP.This proposal, inspired by rules already existing in the United States, will be presented on September 13, a European source said. It will then have to be adopted by the European Parliament and the Member States, a process that will take at least several months, or even a year. (September 2)Slovenian Government adopts new package of energy legislationLjubljana (STA) – The Slovenian government has adopted a new package of energy legislation to respond to a worsening of the situation on the electricity and natural gas market. In addition to the proposals of the new gas supply law and the intervention law on emergency measures in the field of energy supply crisis management, it included the proposal for a guarantee law for energy companies.The Minister of Infrastructure, Bojan Kumer, said the Proposal Law on State Guarantee for the obligations of Gen Energy and HSE, the two largest power suppliers in Slovenia, and Geoplin, the countryâ€™s largest gas supplier, have been drafted in recent days. These companies could need funds to cover short-term extreme liquidity burdens.Under this law, the government gives companies buying non-Russian natural gas in markets outside the EU a guarantee of 80 percent of the beneficiaryâ€™s liabilities from loans and from guarantees on the obligations it needs to provide liquidity to buy natural gas in markets outside the EU.

Europe in brief: Europe's leading grain port receives shipments from Ukraine again and von der Leyen wants to cap the price of Russian gas,"A grain ship from Odessa has docked in the port of Ghent for the first time since the start of the war in Ukraine. More news of the week: according to the Eurobarometer, Slovenians are satisfied with the state of their economy and the Turkish President visited the West Balkan state Bosnia-Herzegovina to improve relations. Ukraine resumes shipments to Europe's leading grain portBrussels (BELGA) - A grain ship from Odessa has docked in the port of Ghent for the first time since the start of the war in Ukraine. The arrival meant the  transhipment of grain from Ukraine was resuming, said port operator North Sea Port. On Wednesday morning, the 'Zhe Hai 505' moored at the transhipment company Euro-Silo in the port of Ghent. The vessel left the port of Odessa with 30,000 tons of rapeseed on board.Ghent is considered to be the most important cereal port in Europe. Half of all European grain passes through it. Exports from Ukraine have started again thanks to the humanitarian corridor for grain ships in the Black Sea. This is vital for world grain markets. The storage and transshipment company Euro-Silo normally receives 4.5 million tons of grain, seeds and derivatives annually. Before the war, about 25 to 30 percent of that came from Ukraine. But the blockade of the ports had brought shipments from Ukraine to a complete stop.""There will be more ships with Ukrainian agricultural products to follow,"" said Thierry Cardon, Commercial Manager of Euro-Silo.More vessels are scheduled for mid- and end-September, which means that the transhipment of grain from the Ukraine will start up again. (September 6)Von der Leyen wants to cap the price of Russian gas and impose a solidarity tax on energy firmsBrussels (Europa Press) – The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has presented European governments with her proposal to reduce energy consumption and cap rising prices. The goal is to limit the price paid for Russian gas, thus reducing Moscow's income to finance the war against Ukraine. Furthermore, von der Leyen advocates applying a solidarity tax to large European energy companies and supporting vulnerable businesses and households.Meanwhile, Europe is looking for alternatives to cover its energy needs and is focusing on countries such as Algeria and Qatarand becoming more favourable to nuclear energy, as in the case of Germany. On the other hand, Spain's commitment to MidCat does not currently have the support of the European Commission. MidCat is a gas pipeline that would link the Iberian Peninsula with the rest of the European Union through the Pyrenees. After France rejected the proposal, Brussels has said that it needs to get more data on the viability of the project. (September 5 and 7)Turkey and UK should be invited to meeting of European Political Community, say European sourcesBrussels (AFP) – Turkey and the United Kingdom â€œshould be invitedâ€ to the first meeting of the European Political Community, which is due to bring together the leaders of the 27 EU member states and those of candidate countries or neighbors of the bloc on 6 October in Prague, European sources said on Wednesday.In addition to the EU member states, the leaders of the six West Balkan countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia), the United Kingdom, Norway, Switzerland, Ukraine, Moldova, Iceland, Georgia, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Liechtenstein are expected to receive an invitation â€œsoon,â€ according to one of these sources.This project for a platform for political dialogue and cooperation was launched by French President Emmanuel Macron and endorsed by an EU summit in June. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz reaffirmed his support for the initiative at the end of August. (September 7)Eurobarometer: Slovenians satisfied with the state of the economy, high confidence in the euroBrussels (STA) - Concerns about the state of the economy are growing among EU citizens, according to the latest Eurobarometer survey. The vast majority of those surveyed consider their national economy to be in a poor state. The picture in Slovenia is very different, however. In the survey, 64 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with the economic situation in their country.In Slovenia, support for the European Economic and Monetary Union with a single currency is significantly higher even than the EU-wide trend of increasing support for the euro, which has reached a high of 72 percent, according to the Eurobarometer survey. Slovenia stands at 88 percent.While 57 percent of respondents at EU level are satisfied with the EU's response to the war in Ukraine, this percentage is lower in Slovenia. 45 percent of respondents expressed satisfaction with Brussels' response to the Russian aggression in Ukraine. Just over two-thirds of respondents support the supply of military equipment to Ukraine, compared to only half in Slovenia, and Slovenians are less in favor of sanctions against Russia than the European average. (September 6)Turkish President Erdogan visited BiH for talks focusing on economic cooperationSarajevo (FENA) - The President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, visited Bosnia and Herzegovina with a large delegation and met the chairman and members of the Presidency of BiH and members of the collegium of both houses of the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH. At a press conference in Sarajevo, the leaders said relations between Turkey and BiH were exceptionally good, and that in addition to political, military and economic ties, the countriesâ€™ history, culture and personal ties made the relationship even stronger.Erdogan said Turkey continued unquestioningly to provide development aid and that talks were underway to enable citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Turkey to travel between the two countries using their identity cards. He emphasized that Turkey paid great attention to the peace, prosperity and stability of BiH, and that it supported its territorial integrity and sovereignty. He said he hoped that the election outcome would be beneficial for the whole of BiH. He underlined that Turkey was against any intervention of the high representative of the international community in BiH, Christian Schmidt, regarding changes to the Election Law of BiH, because that would run counter to democratic principles. ""The decision on this should be made by the leaders. We have a period that is shorter than a month, and during that period any interventions by the high representative are interventions related to the democratic process of BiH. We are against any intervention,"" Erdogan said.He said discussions were also held on improving bilateral trade, which reached 876 million dollars an increase of almost 35 percent compared to the previous year. Both sides attached great importance to the construction of the Sarajevo-Belgrade highway. ""It is a peace project that will connect not only the countries of the region, but also the peoples, and I believe that with this visit we have given new momentum to that strategic project,"" said Erdogan.

Europe's reaction to the ongoing energy crisis,"EU countries are scrambling to face up to a challenging winter ahead, with consumers facing skyrocketing energy prices. Brussels plans a series of measures aimed at shielding households and businesses from high energy costs.  Once again, on September 9, the EU energy ministers came together to an extraordinary meeting to push plans to tackle the current energy crisis. The European Commission presented a non-paper to address the challenges in the energy market. ""We are facing an extraordinary situation, because Russia is an unreliable supplier and is manipulating our energy markets,"" warned EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as she announced a series of measures ahead of the energy council. ""Our unity and our solidarity will ensure that we will prevail.""Revenue cap for non-gas electricity producersOne set of measures proposed by the European Commission aims to limit the revenues of non-gas electricity companies that profit disproportionately from rising energy costs. Companies producing electricity from renewable energy sources are currently making ""enormous revenues, revenues they never calculated with, revenues they never dreamt of and revenues they cannot reinvest,"" von der Leyen said. ""It is now time for the consumers to benefit from the low costs of low carbon sources, like for example, the renewables,"" she said.""Skimming off the excess revenues should make resources available to EU countries to ""support the vulnerable households and vulnerable companies,"" the Commission President said.Currently, the price of electricity in Europe is mainly determined by expensive gas-fired power plants, which are switched on to produce electricity due to high demand. Because of the Ukraine war, the price of gas has risen sharply and the situation on the energy market is tense. Energy companies that produce cheaper electricity - from wind, solar or nuclear power, for example - are making big profits.According to a first draft of the legislation seen by dpa, the revenue cap could be set at 200 euros per megawatt hour. Member states would have to put a mechanism in place to collect the revenues exceeding that cap. The amount can however still change until the final bill is proposed.On September 7, the wholesale market price for electricity in Germany was about 460 euros per megawatt hour. A 200-euro-cap would be good news for the industry, the bank Goldman Sachs said in a statement, as the business plans of most utilities are based on an electricity price of about 50 euros per megawatt hour. The EU Commission stressed in the draft bill that the revenue cap should take into account the production costs and allow further investment.Von der Leyen also proposed a ""solidarity contribution"" for fossil fuel companies. ""Oil and gas companies have also made massive profits,"" von der Leyen said, adding that ""all energy sources must help to overcome this crisis."" Revenues from this contribution, collected at national level, should be used to finance reduced energy bills for vulnerable households and businesses and support a faster move to green energy.Smart savings of electricityThe President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, speaks after her meeting with the President of the Government, at the headquarters of Red ElÃ©ctrica de EspaÃ±a, on June 16, 2021, in Alcobendas, Madrid (Spain). Photo: Europa Press (archiv photo)Von der Leyen also proposed a mandatory target to reduce electricity consumption during periods of high demand to ""flatten the curve"" of electricity price fluctuations. According to the draft seen by dpa, this target could be set at 5 percent. The commission president also said there is a need to support energy utilities that are currently struggling with the enormous volatility of the markets and face liquidity problems.Lowering gas pricesThe EU Commissionâ€™s finally proposed measures aiming to lowering the cost of gas include a price cap on Russian gas. â€œWe must cut Russiaâ€™s revenues, which Putin uses to finance his atrocious war in Ukraine. And now our work of the last month really pays off. Because, at the beginning of the war, if you looked at the imported gas, 40 percent of it was Russian gas, since a long time. Today, we are down to 9  percent only.â€Several EU member states including Italy and Poland would like to introduce a price cap on all gas imported to the EU, not just the Russian gas. According to diplomatic sources, the EU Commission is interested in studying the proposal while the Netherlands expressed scepticism not only on the price cap on gas but also towards all the measures aiming to intervene in markets starting from the virtual trading point for natural gas, also known as TTF, in the Netherlands.Â Â Meanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin replied warning that any country that introduces a price cap will receive no Russian energy supplies at all: ""No gas, no oil, no coal, no fuel oil, nothing."" On September 2, Russian energy giant Gazprom announced a complete shutdown of the crucial Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. The Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), based in Finland, estimates that since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the EU has been the main importer of fossil fuels from Russia, worth 85 billion euros. However, the EU has significantly reduced its fossil fuel imports from Russia over the past six months, the researchers noted.National outlooksSlovenia – self-sufficient in electricity, but dependent on gas importsSlovenia is one of the advocates of a coordinated European approach to electricity price regulation and structural market reform in the face of rising energy prices and speculative purchases. Slovenia is about 75 percent self-sufficient in electricity, the lowest in ten years due to drought, while it is entirely dependent on gas imports, so far mainly from Russia. It gets its gas from the natural gas hub in Baumgarten in Austria, from where it imported 85 percent of its total imports last year since it does not have its own gas storage facilities.In preparation for a worst-case scenario, the Slovenian government has already taken a series of measures to limit high prices and ensure a smooth energy supply for the population and some businesses. Amendments to the Gas Supply Act to further protect gas consumers from increased supply risks, a bill on guarantees for the main state-owned energy companies and an emergency bill on measures to deal with energy supply crises will be discussed in the National Assembly next week. The latter gives the government the power to directly order state-owned companies to implement energy security measures to ensure a reliable supply of energy in a state of emergency in case of disrupted energy supplies. Representatives of Slovenian businesses insist that the government should set a cap on the price of energy products for businesses.According to the largest business associations in Slovenia, an agreement on such a solution must be reached at the EU level as soon as possible. Slovenian companies, which are already feeling the first signs of turbulence, have expressed fears of production cuts or even shutdowns and a wave of redundancies if no solution is found. The government is determined to help the economy with additional measures to be agreed in October. Prime Minister Robert Golob has estimated that they could be worth 1.5 billion euros.MidCat gas pipeline: Spain advocates it, France says noMeanwhile, Spain and Germany are trying to find alternative solutions. They both advocate the construction of the MidCat gas pipeline that would connect Spain and France. However, the European Commission on September 6 avoided openly supporting the construction of the gas pipeline. French President Emmanuel Macron insisted that his country opposes the project that would cross the Pyrenees, increasing the level of interconnection between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the continent.Macron said he does not understand ""the short-term problem that they are trying to solve"" with the construction of MidCat and argued that the other two pipelines that currently link the two countries, through the Basque Country and Navarre, are ""underused"" given that they have been operated at 53 percent of capacity since February.The European Commission's energy spokesman pointed out that MidCat is not on the EU's list of projects of common interest (PCI) because the French and Spanish authorities decided to put it ""on hold"" pending ""new evaluations"" after finding that the project was not ""mature"". He also stressed that, according to the recently approved new legislation on energy infrastructures, projects based on fossil fuels such as gas cannot be financed with European resources.This would rule out European funding for MidCat. The European Commission's energy spokesperson insisted that in general, any new investment connecting the Iberian peninsula's liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals to the European gas grid through ""hydrogen-ready"" infrastructure could ""contribute to further diversify gas supply in the internal market"" and would ""help the future green hydrogen potential"" of Spain and Portugal and North Africa. But, again, he reiterated that the project that Spain wants ""is not at the point where (the European Commission) can assess whether it can receive funding"".Bosniaâ€™s complete dependence on Russian gasBosnia and Herzegovina has no gas reserves and relies completely on Russian gas supplies. Only one branch of the ""TurkStream"" gas pipeline, which runs from Russia through the Black Sea via Turkey and ends in Bosnia and Herzegovina, supplies the two cities Sarajevo and Zenica including their surroundings, with natural gas.Work has been underway to expand the gas pipeline network to other parts of the country, but this process is not moving fast enough. For now, Bosnia and Herzegovina has not been added to Russiaâ€™s list of ""enemy countries.""Diversification of the supply is planned with the construction of the ""Southern Interconnection"" gas pipeline, which would connect Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia. However, the project is still in the approval phase.On the other hand, due to thermal power plants and hydro-accumulations, Bosnia and Herzegovina produces sufficient amounts of electricity for its own needs, and part of the electricity produced is exported. It is thanks to exports that electricity companies are managing to sell electricity on the domestic market at more favorable prices. The authorities have announced that by the end of this year there will definitely not be an increase in the price of electricity for households.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: EU integration of Western Balkans, EU law to protect media freedom as well as a threatening recession in the eurozone","While leaders of Western Balkan countries met in Slovenia to discuss progress on EU integration, Brussels is gearing up to support journalists with a new media freedom law. What also happened: EU finance ministers met in Prague to challenge the risk of a recession.Slovenia: Western Balkans leaders met for the Brdo-Brijuni summit Brdo pri Kranju (STA) – Western Balkan leaders met for the Brdo-Brijuni summit in Slovenia on Monday. They once again underlined the importance of EU enlargement for the stability of their region. Now more than ever, this has become a geopolitical issue, they believe. The leaders did not produce a final declaration at the summit. Slovenian President Borut Pahor told the press he was happy that the summit even took place given the challenging circumstances, and that they were able to agree on six resolutions. In the six resolutions the leaders managed to agree on, they called on the EU to grant Bosnia-Herzegovina EU candidate status by the end of the year, introduce a visa-free travel regime for the entire Balkans, and help the region in mitigating the effects of the economic and energy crises.Pahor said that the idea of a final declaration had been given up already during preparations for the summit when it became clear consensus could not be reached. Allegedly, the reason for this was disagreement over Croatia's wish that the declaration mentions the constitutionality of all three nations of Bosnia-Herzegovina. Croatians in Bosnia-Herzegovina are pushing for an election reform, which is not supported by the Bosniaks. In a separate statement after the meeting, Å efik DÅ¾aferoviÄ‡, a member of the Bosnia-Herzegovina's presiding trio, said that electoral legislation was an internal matter of his country and that the Brdo-Brijuni Process initiative was not a forum dedicated to Bosnia's internal affairs. Croatian President Zoran MilanoviÄ‡ criticized the EU for granting candidate status to Ukraine in June but not to Bosnia. He believes that an organization conducting its foreign policy in such a way was not on the right path. Meanwhile, Pahor said that granting candidate status to Bosnia-Herzegovina, even if only a symbolic move, was a geopolitical issue par excellence.Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani commented on the visa-free travel regime, expressing the expectation that it would indeed be introduced. Kosovo remains the only Western Balkan country whose nationals require a visa to enter the EU. Osmani also said that Kosovo would lodge a candidate status request with the EU. The leaders also affirmed their dedication to dialogue as the only path to overcoming differences. Hosted by Pahor and MilanoviÄ‡, the summit featured their counterparts from the region. The summit was attended by Albanian President Bajram Begaj, Bosnia and Herzegovina's presiding trio Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡, Milorad Dodik and DÅ¾aferoviÄ‡, Montenegro's President Milo ÄukanoviÄ‡, Kosovo's Osmani, North Macedonia's Stevo Pendarovski and Serbia's Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡. (September 12)Eurozone acknowledges risk of recession and promises anti-inflation measuresPrague (EFE) – Eurozone governments are aware that the war in Ukraine has increased the risk of a recession. However, they have ruled out that the economy is inevitably doomed to slump and have promised to take measures to contain inflation and mitigate its effects on households and businesses.""The risk has increased, but the recession is not inevitable,"" Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe and European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni told a press conference last Friday after a meeting of Eurozone finance and economy ministers in Prague. The ministers discussed how to respond to the crisis stemming from the Russian aggression, which has increased energy prices, pushed inflation in the Eurozone to a record 9.1 percent in August and forced it to lower growth forecasts of the Nineteen to the point that the European Central Bank (ECB) anticipates a recession in the event of a total cut-off of Russian gas.So we need to find a delicate balance between promoting growth, controlling inflation and protecting the most vulnerable.EU Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis In this scenario, the ministers agreed that they will continue to ""intervene to support the most vulnerable households and businesses"" in the face of an ""unprecedented challenge"": Donohoe said: ""We need to bring inflation down. If we don't, our citizens will be poorer in the long-term."" The measures should be temporary and selective and preferably based on income rather than on intervention in market prices, participants agreed. Such a combination will be difficult to achieve at a time of growing social pressure to curb a price escalation that has reached the entire shopping basket. (September 9)Media monopoly and pressure on journalists: Brussels arms itself against abusesVera Jourova, Vice President of the European Commission in charge of values and transparency, speaks at a press conference following the weekly meeting of the European Commission. Photo: Christophe Licoppe/European Commission/dpaBrussels (AFP) – Wary of the deterioration of press independence in Hungary and Poland, the European Commission has decided to adopt a law to regulate media mergers and protect journalists from pressure. Newsrooms should be independent of political or industrial power and media ownership should be transparent, according to a draft regulation of which AFP has obtained a provisional version. In case of non-compliance, the ""Media Freedom Law"" will allow the Commission to initiate proceedings in the European courts. It will be officially presented by the Commission at the end of next week.Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ has repeatedly expressed a feeling of powerlessness, pointing to Brussels' ""limited"" room for maneuver in the media sector. This was particularly evident in the creation of the pro-Viktor Orban media conglomerate in Hungary in 2018, where European competition rules could not be applied. (September 10)Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) reform gets into full swing, European Commission proposals in OctoberPrague (ANSA) – The era of post-Covid expansionary policies is set to end. 2023 will have to be the year of ""prudence"" and a return to debt sustainability. The message coming from the informal meeting of finance ministers in Prague leaves no room for ambiguity: the 27 must gear up for targeted and temporary investments without losing sight of their budgets in a policy shift imposed on them by the impact of inflation. That approach will also guide the revision of the Stability Pact that the Commission will launch at the end of October.EU Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said ""the key to the revision is broad convergence"" but added that the devil lay in the details. Those details are likely to rekindle the debate between hawks and doves. According to one European source, an overall agreement is far from being reached and even France and Germany don't appear to be on the same page, with the latter appearing to be playing the hawk role again.By contrast the Netherlands, with a joint document signed with Spain last April, has taken a more open-minded stance by saying yes to fiscal consolidation tailored to the specific realities of the countries. By providing a one-twentieth cut in the share of debt that exceeds 60 percent of GDP each year, debt reduction could be paced â€œmore realistically.â€ ""We need to ensure that debt is actually reduced, reduce complexity and improve compliance,"" EU Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis explained.The other hot topic is investments. The idea of unbundling those related to green and defense has been rejected by Germany but continues to have several supporters among European governments. Dombrovskis called green, digital, and European security investments ""necessary,"" without going into further details. At the same time, it will be necessary for the EU Commission to simplify the parameters of EU surveillance, basing them on a single indicator such as a benchmark of public spending. (September 10).German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and EU Council President Charles Michel emphasize European cohesion in the energy crisisBerlin (dpa) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (SPD) and EU Council President Charles Michel have stressed European solidarity in the energy crisis. Scholz said during a meeting with Michel in Berlin on Friday that the Russian president had all but halted gas supplies to the West. â€œBy stopping gas deliveries, President Putin aims to weaken and destabilize the European democracies. He will not succeed. He has made a misjudgment, as we Europeans are standing side by side in solidarity,â€ Scholz said,More than ever, Michel added, Europe saw that it needed unity. Ukraine would continue to receive support in all areas. The sanctions, he said, were aimed at making clear that the EU was united against the unjustified attack against Ukraine.

"Europe in brief: EU Parliament backs boost for renewable energies, illegal immigration in Bosnia in decline, Spain's justice system under fire","This week in Strasbourg, MEPs voted on plans to speed up the expansion of renewable energy and reduce energy consumption. In other news: While the migrant crisis in Bosnia is far from over, the number of illegal migrant arrivals decreased. Also: Brussels calls on Spain to end the blockade of its justice system. EU Parliament backs higher green energy and energy saving targetsStrasbourg (dpa) – The European Parliament passed two draft bills on Wednesday setting more ambitious targets for boosting renewable energy use while cutting overall energy consumption. EU legislators endorsed increasing the share of green energy consumed in the European Union to 45 percent by 2030. EU capitals had previously backed a binding target of 40 percent.According to Germany's Federal Statistical Office, 22 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union and 19 percent in Germany comes from renewable sources. The draft bill also deals with criteria for labeling certain energy sources as green, including biomass and hydrogen. Biomass is considered a sustainable energy source, though activists and scientists have criticized the fact that burning wood, for instance, releases high levels of climate-damaging carbon dioxide (CO2) that would otherwise be bound up in plants. The EU Parliament wants to keep biomass, including wood, a sustainable source of energy but wants to cap its amount and phase out certain subsidies.Lawmakers also set criteria for defining hydrogen as green, including what power plants can be used to produce it. Hydrogen can be produced with electricity from renewable sources. Lawmakers also voted in favor of introducing higher energy-saving targets. EU countries are to reduce end-user energy consumption by at least 14.4 percent by 2030, compared to 2007 projections.The European Parliament and the Council, the EU body representing the 27 member states, vote on draft bills to approve their positions before entering negotiations between the different institutions, in which the texts are finalized before the laws enter into force. The two pieces of legislation are part of the blocâ€™s climate change package dubbed Fit for 55, aiming to reduce climate-damaging emissions by 55% by 2030, when compared to 1990 levels, and reach climate neutrality by 2050. (September 14)North Macedonia begins the explanatory screening with the EUBrussels (MIA) - North Macedonia, together with Albania, is starting the explanatory screening with the European Commission on September 15. The last explanatory screening for these two countries ended in 2019, and now it is necessary to update the involved teams on the latest EU acquis.The European Commission told MIA on September 14 that it remained fully committed to the advancement of the EU process with Skopje and Tirana. â€œThis is the first and significant step in the negotiation process, fully supported by the governments and parliaments of both countries,â€ European Commission Spokesperson Ana Pisonero told MIA.She said all parties would have an ""intensive work program"" in the coming months starting with the Fundamentals. These technical meetings are expected to last about two months, after which the bilateral screenings should begin.After the bilateral screening is over, North Macedonia will be able to formally start the negotiations by clusters and chapters with the EU, but only if it first changes the Constitution and brings the Bulgarians into it as a constituent nation. (September 15)Migration: Significant drop in the number of illegal migrants in Bosnia and HerzegovinaSarajevo (FENA) – The number of illegal migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) amounted to between 1,500 and 2,000 in 2022, which is a decrease compared to the last two years. According to data from the BiH Ministry of Security, an average of 5,900 migrants stayed in refugee reception centers in BiH in 2020, falling to an average of 3,800 in 2021.""The Service for Foreigners' Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina relocated migrants from abandoned buildings and forcibly returned migrants who are in Bosnia and Herzegovina illegally to their countries of origin,"" the Ministry told news agency Fena. The State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) and the Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina cooperate in monitoring the country's border in order to combat human trafficking and smuggling. In addition, the ministry said it had strengthened control and security in the camps. ""All these measures have made transit through Bosnia and Herzegovina more expensive, and a significant number of migrants are trying to reach their final destinations using other routes,"" the Ministry said.There are currently about 2,000 migrants in refugee reception centers in BiH. Most of them come from Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iran and Morocco. According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM) the migrant situation in BiH is now stable and more favorable than in previous years, with enough accommodation capacity for people on the move who need accommodation.

"Windfall levies, Ukraine and protecting the rule of law – EU Commission chief von der Leyen’s agenda for the upcoming year
","EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s third State of the Union speech was dominated by the war in Ukraine and finding answers to soaring energy prices in Europe. In her annual address to the European Parliament, she proposed a windfall levy. But not everyone is convinced and there is still work to be done. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Wednesday announced a legislative proposal to impose windfall levies on energy companies as the EU grapples with surging gas and power prices that threaten economies and households.The levies could make more than â‚¬140 billion available for EU member states to support struggling families and businesses, she told the European Parliament in Strasbourg during her annual State of the Union address.â€œIn these times, profits must be shared and channeled to those who need it the most,â€ von der Leyen said in Strasbourg.Von der Leyenâ€™s plan, which has yet to be approved by EU capitals, focuses on two measures: capping revenues of low-cost electricity producers as well as charging fossil fuel companies a crisis contribution.The first measure is to apply to non-gas electricity producers, including renewable energy providers that have been profiting disproportionately from the high prices in recent months.The second measure, the crisis contribution, is targeted at fossil fuel companies that are currently making excess profits.Other steps laid out by von der Leyen include rationing energy, temporary state aid and decoupling the prices of gas and electricity. The European Commission presented its legislative proposal to tackle rising energy prices in detail on Wednesday.Not a done deal yetâ€œI am very happy that it has finally been decided to reform the electricity system, so that the price of gas does not determine the price of all electricity at certain times. We now have to take urgent measures,â€ the EUâ€™s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, told EFE after attending the debate in Strasbourg.The measures proposed on Wednesday will be scrutinized and potentially amended by member states before they can come into force. EU energy ministers are set to meet again on September 30.No price cap on Russian imported gasEnergy measures mooted ahead of von der Leyenâ€™s speech included a price cap on imported Russian gas. On that point Europeâ€™s chief diplomat Borrell noted that â€œthe unanimity of all the Member States is required.â€â€œThe President did not propose it. She has talked about it, but she has not formally proposed it, because she knows the political difficulties that exist,â€ Borrell pointed out.EU countries are also wary of giving the Commission too much power over their national energy policies, even though they have already been swept up in a bloc-wide push towards renewables as part of a carbon-neutral future.Borrell recalled that the EU has already reduced its dependence on Russian gas â€œfrom 40 percent of our imports before the war, to less than 10 percent now.â€Ukraine: Difficult times aheadVon der Leyen warned of difficult times ahead, referring to the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine.â€œThe moments ahead of us will not be easy. Be it for the families who are struggling to make ends meet or businesses who are facing tough choices concerning their future,â€ von der Leyen told lawmakers.â€œLet us be very clear. Much is at stake, not just for Ukraine, but for all of Europe and the world at large,â€ von der Leyen added.â€œThis is not only a war unleashed by Russia against Ukraine. This is also a war on our energy, itâ€™s a war on our economy, itâ€™s a war on our values, it is a war on our future,â€ von der Leyen said.Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s trip to UkraineSpeaking in the presence of Ukraineâ€™s first lady Olena Zelenska and dressed in blue and yellow, the colours of Ukraineâ€™s flag, von der Leyen announced her travel to Kyiv later that day. After the speech she went on her third visit to the Ukrainian capital since the start of the Russian invasion.She said she would discuss Ukraineâ€™s integration into the European Unionâ€™s single market with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The European single market guarantees the free movement of goods, capital, services and people. Von der Leyen also proposed to include Ukraine in the blocâ€™s free roaming zone for mobile device users.More flexible budget rules to be proposed by OctoberTurning to other issues the Commission president said she backed  calls for making the blocâ€™s joint budget rules more flexible.The EUâ€™s strict rules for fiscal discipline and budget deficits are suspended until 2024 because the Covid-19 pandemic prompted even frugal countries like Germany to take on large amounts of public debt.Von der Leyen said the new rules, which the Commission is due to propose in detail in October, should allow needed investments in â€œthe transition to a digital and net zero economyâ€ while giving EU capitals more ownership in reducing their public debt reliably.Shield against â€œmalign interferenceâ€In her speech von der Leyen revealed a package on Defence of Democracy in order to â€œbetter shield ourselves from malign interferenceâ€. She added: â€œIt will bring covert foreign influence and shady funding to light. We will not allow any autocracyâ€™s Trojan horses to attack our democracies from withinâ€.Her announcement came as a US intelligence report on Russian funding of foreign political parties hit the campaign for Italyâ€™s September 25 general election. According to the report, Russia has given over $300 million (â‚¬ 300,54 million) to foreign political parties, officials and politicians in more than 20 countries since 2014.â€œThe US intelligence report shows how Russiaâ€™s influence in Western politics works at various levels and in sprawling ways, up to the funding of some political parties,â€ said European Parliament Vice President Pina Picierno, urging â€œto keep our guard upâ€ as â€œPutin wants to destabilize democracies and the free world, directly supporting some political partiesâ€.â€œWe must firmly respond to the constant Russian meddling in our democracies, as the Ukrainiansâ€™ fight is our fight, their victory against Putin will be our victory,â€ MEP and EDP Secretary General Sandro Gozi said, commenting on the speech.Promise to protect rule of lawAlluding to the Commissionâ€™s ongoing disputes with Hungary and Poland, von der Leyen said it was the Commissionâ€™s â€œduty and the most noble role to protect the rule of law.â€â€œLet me assure you that we will keep insisting on judicial independence,â€ she noted.Praise and criticism for the plansIn their reactions to von der Leyen's speech, the majority of the parliamentary group leaders welcomed the proposals to overcome the energy crisis. Manfred Weber, leader of the strongest EPP group, expressed his ""full support"" for Ursula von der Leyen's content of the plans, but criticized the procedure and appealed for the EU Parliament to be more involved in the decision-making process. Socialists criticized the lack of social aspects in the speech. S&D Group leader Iratxe Garcia Perez wrote on Twitter, â€œWe heard fancy words by Ursula von der Leyen, but the social dimension was neglected.""  The Left Party also voiced criticism after the speech. Co-chair Martin Schirdewan told dpa that Ursula von der Leyen had ""more than clearly demonstrated that the title of 'announcement world champion' will not be taken away from her in her lifetime.Slovenian Infrastructure Minister Bojan Kumer welcomed the latest measures to tackle the energy crisis that were announced by Ursula von der Leyen. Kumer told RTV Slovenija on Wednesday evening that solidarity among EU members had been clearly expressed, â€œespecially in the energy market,â€ noting that a joint European solution was far better than 27 different national solutions. He welcomed the measures to curb electricity prices that were outlined by von der Leyen in her State of the Union address on Wednesday, saying that the proposal would be carefully examined in the coming days. At first glance, it seems to include a number of solutions advocated by Slovenia too, he added.Sloveniaâ€™s MEPs said von der Leyen managed to list the main challenges of the bloc in her speech. However, they believe she left out a number of key issues, especially concrete short-term measures to help people overcome the economic and energy crisis.Waiting for the plansRomanian Prime Minister Nicolae CiucÄƒ declared earlier that through the changes proposed to an ordinance (OUG 27/2022), the Romanian government wanted to consolidate and expand the measures to protect the population and the economy against the price increases recorded for electricity and natural gas. He announced that the Romanian scheme of capping and invoice compensation would remain in force until March 31, 2023, and that the overtaxation targeted the entire energy chain, not just the producers, with measures intended to discourage speculative behavior in the electricity and natural gas market.At the same time, he stressed that Bucharest was ready, depending on the decisions adopted at EU level, to adapt its own measures  accordingly.This article is published Fridays.

Memes share fake Queen Elizabeth II quote about Hillary Clinton,"Social media posts claim Queen Elizabeth II announced before she died that she had information that could lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton. This is false; there is no record of the queen making such a statement, and the claim matches a years-old meme that reflects a conspiracy theory that the former secretary of state and her husband kill their political opponents.""I have information that will lead to the arrest of Hillary Clinton,"" the queen is quoted as saying in an Instagram post shared September 9, 2022.Variations of the same message circulated across Facebook and Instagram in posts that appeared to show screenshots of Twitter pages associated with the queen. Twitter accounts impersonating her also repeated the line.The posts come after the queen's death September 8 at age 96. Buckingham Palace said she died peacefully at Balmoral, the British royal family's residence in Scotland.Screenshots taken on September 13, 2022 of images shared on Facebook and InstagramScreenshot of an Instagram post taken September 13, 2022Some social media users appeared to take the posts seriously. But the quote is not genuine; AFP found no record of the queen issuing such a statement about Clinton, a former US presidential candidate and secretary of state.The images shared online feature various Twitter handles, such as @queenelizabeth and @queenelizabethII. But the former is suspended and the latter does not exist.Another widely shared image claims to show the royal family's official Twitter account saying the queen had information about Clinton's alleged criminal acts. But that account has never posted about Clinton, live and archived versions of the page show.Fabricated tweets purporting to show public figures saying they have incriminating information about Clinton are part of a long-running internet meme.The meme is predicated on allegations that Clinton and her husband, former US president Bill Clinton, are responsible for the deaths of numerous political opponents. The baseless claims date back to the 1990s and have contributed to the rise of other conspiracy theories, such as QAnon.The meme has sticking power in part because ""it functions like a game,"" said Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public who has written about the so-called ""Clinton Body Count"" conspiracy theory.""For any prominent death, you can ask, 'Did this person know the Clintons or know someone who knew the Clintons?' Given the wide circle of connections that politicians make, the answer will probably be yes, and you're off to the races,"" Caulfield said. ""The 'Clinton Body Count' is one of the simplest misinformation games out there, which gives it high participatory potential and a lot of engagement.""Previous iterations of the meme have targeted everyone from former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and former Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev to professional basketball legend Kobe Bryant and celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain.AFP has fact-checked other misinformation about the queen's death here.Bill MCCARTHYAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesUS POLITICSFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: The EU Commission proposes to freeze 7.5 billion euros in payments to Hungary, Countries react to EU's proposed media law","Brussels has proposed suspending the disbursement of 7, 5 billion euros to Hungary. The EU Commission wants a new media law: Slovenia welcomes the plan which would also have to be applied by candidate countries. Also: EU and Bosnia and Herzegovina continue their migration cooperation and Croatia obtained 8.13 billion euros in EU funds over the last nine years.Brussels wants to freeze funds to Hungary over violating the rule of lawBrussels/Budapest (EFE) – The European Commission on Sunday proposed suspending the payment of 7.5 billion in European funds to Hungary due to continuing violations of the principles of the rule of law, especially in the fight against corruption and fraud in public procurement.â€œWe ask to suspend the disbursement of 65 percent of the commitments of three operational programs of the Cohesion Policy for an estimated amount of 7.5 billion euros, which represents more than a third of Hungaryâ€™s cohesion endowment,â€ said Johannes Hahn, European Commissioner for Budgets.The freezing of funds must now be approved within one month by the rest of the Member States by a qualified majority. This means that Poland – Hungaryâ€™s major partner in these matters – has no veto power. However, this deadline can be extended by another two months: Hahn said the EU Commission will submit the proposal to the Member States no later than September 22 and will ask them to extend the deadline for them to decide. Budapest is committed to fully informing the Commission about the implementation of the corrective measures by November 19, according to EU sources.Brussels decided to take this step while waiting for the Government of Viktor OrbÃ¡n to implement the promised reforms to resolve the deficiencies identified by the EU authorities and which led to the proposed suspension of payments. The Hungarian Government, for its part, said it will continue to negotiate to prevent the funding cut from taking effect. The Commissionâ€™s decision, which was taken on Sunday because the Commissioners could not meet this Wednesday due to agenda incompatibilities, came in the same week in which the European Parliament warned that Hungary was already â€œa hybrid regime of electoral autocracyâ€ and not a democracy. (18. September)New law on media freedom in the EU, North Macedonia must adaptBrussels (MIA) - The European Commission has tabled a series of new rules to protect pluralism and independence in the media across the EU, whether they are private or state-funded. Although these rules apply to the EU member states, candidate countries are expected to integrate them into their laws and practices, said the EU Commissioner for Transparency and Values, Vera Jourova. The new legislation is aimed at ending political and party influence in the media so that journalists can work freely. State advertising is also under scrutiny.Under the new rules, the funding of state and public media will have to be adequate, stable, predictable and ensure independence.The law will be important for candidate countries and negotiating countries, such as North Macedonia, because it will be one of the conditions in the accession process.""We made it clear that we consider the situation with the media to be an important element for assessing the quality and sustainability in the candidate countries, it is on the radar of our negotiators,"" said Vera Jourova.She added that for the representatives of candidate countries such as North Macedonia, this was a ""clear signal"" that the EU aimed for stronger protection of the media, and that this would be part of the negotiations with the EU.The European Commissioner for the EU's internal market, Thierry Breton, added that when a country becomes a member of the EU, it must fully comply with the rules of the internal market.""Candidate countries will have to fulfill all aspects of the internal market, respect EU legislation, and the European Commission will have all the tools to ensure that things go in the right direction,"" Breton said. (16. September)Culture Ministry and several Slovenian MEPs welcome new EU media proposal Ljubljana/Brussels (STA)- Sloveniaâ€™s Ministry of Culture welcomed the proposal of the EU Commission for a new media law. Brussels wants to ensure the transparent functioning of the media in the internal market, taking into account the impact of digital transformation and the influence of large platforms, the ministry said following Fridayâ€™s presentation. The European Media Act also seeks to increase the freedom and independence of the media.When asked whether the Slovenian legislation met the requirements of this law or whether changes will be needed, the Ministry said it could not comment further on the proposal as it had only learned of it on the day it was presented.However, when asked whether Slovenia supported the proposal and whether it had participated in its preparation, the Ministry said that in preparing the proposal for the act, the Commission had conducted extensive public consultations involving Slovenian experts and media representatives. Slovenia would participate in debating the act in the framework of the work of the EU Council in the coming months.The proposal for an act on freedom of the media was welcomed by the majority of Slovenian MEPs. Irena Joveva, member of the Renew Europe-group in the European Parliament, said it was urgently needed legislation at EU level as media freedom had been in precipitous decline in many member states in recent years. Â Her party colleague Klemen GroÅ¡elj (Renew), however, regretted that one of the triggers for the proposed law was the behaviour of the previous government led by Janez JanÅ¡a, which systematically financially drained the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) and restricted the freedom of the media sector. He added that he saw a continuation in the behaviour of the current RTV management (national broadcaster) and the members of the Programme Council appointed by the previous session of the National Assembly. MatjaÅ¾ Nemec of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament said the proposals represented a â€œturning pointâ€ as they would permit action in cases of violation of media freedom in EU member states. Ljudmila Novak, member of the European Peopleâ€™s Party, on the other hand, argued that objective, fact-based media reporting and legitimate criticism of the authorities were two fundamental values that should be respected by the media and the authorities. (16. September)BiH and EU Continue Cooperation in Migration ManagementSarajevo (FENA)- The European Union has positively assessed the initiated processes of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on the repatriation of migrants to their countries of origin, as well as the overall cooperation with the Ministry of Security of BiH in migration management.The representatives of the Ministry of Security of BiH, SaÅ¡a Kecman, and the Deputy Director of the Service for Foreigner Affairs of BiH, Mirsad Buzar, discussed these issues with EU officials in Brussels.During the meeting with the Head of the Department for BiH and Kosovo, Vassilis Maragos, and Head of the Migration Support Department at the Directorate for Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement (DG NEAR), Francisco Gaztelu, they discussed the current situation in migration management and future cooperation in this area.The participants pointed out that the return of illegal migrants remains a priority for BiH, but also for the EU. Soon, EU funding for this purpose is expected to be operational so that repatriations of larger groups of migrants can be carried out. (15. September)Croatia withdraws 8.13 billion euros from EU funds in 9 years of membershipZagreb (HINA)- Croatia withdrew 8.13 billion euros from European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) from 2013 to September 8 this year, almost 76 percent of EU funds allocated, while the state budget is in plus for HRK 64.85 billion (8.623 billion euros), the Ministry for Regional Development and EU Funds said on September 14.Minister NataÅ¡a TramiÅ¡ak presented a report on the use of ESIF funds on September 14 at the Government session, which was then adopted, the statement said.According to the ministry, the ESIF had a total of EUR 10.73 billion (HRK 81.56 billion) available to Croatia for the period 2014-2020.By 8 September this year, projects worth 13.64 billion euros (or 103.69 billion kuna), or 127.14 percent of the allocated funds were contracted.In total, 8.13 billion euros (HRK 61.81 billion) were paid, or 75.79 percent of the allocated funds, and 6.9 billion euros (HRK 52.47 billion), or 64.34 percent of the allocated funds were certified.If the 763.17 million euros from REACT EU and 597.56 million euros added to the Rural Development Program are added to the original allocation of the ESI funds 2014-202, the total allocation by 2023 is 12.09 billion euros.In the period from 2013 to 8 September this year, the difference between the paid funds from the EU budget to the budget of the Republic of Croatia and the funds paid from the budget of the Republic of Croatia to the EU budget amounts to 53.45 billion kuna (7.106 billion euros) in favor of the budget of the Republic of Croatia.Including the paid advance for the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NPOO), Croatia has a surplus of HRK 64.85 billion (8.623 billion euros), according to the Ministry's announcement.

Brussels in favor of Slovenia's candidacy for the UN Security Council. Moreover this week: European Commissioner sees lack of progress in solving Slovakiaâ€™s Roma issue. Bulgarian News Agency BTA becomes seat of the Association of Balkan News Agencies. German data retention overturned after ECJ ruling.Belgian Prime Minister De Croo responds to Putin: â€œAs far as Belgium is concerned, you couldnâ€™t have a more threatening situationâ€Brussels (Belga) – Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo underlined the seriousness of the escalation of Russiaâ€™s aggression against Ukraine at the United Nations headquarters in New York on September 21. ""We are here at the seat of multilateralism, at a time when one of its founding members is violating all the rules of multilateralism and attacking a former colony. As far as Belgium is concerned, you couldnâ€™t have a more threatening situation.""De Croo arrived at the UN headquarters on the day Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a partial mobilization to reinforce troops in Ukraine and expressed support for the referenda in the Ukrainian regions of Luhansk, Donetsk, Kherson and Zaporizhia, which are seen in the West as a stepping stone to Russian annexation. Putin also lashed out harshly at the West, including allusions to nuclear retaliation.""What we are witnessing today is unprecedented. I think that even in the most difficult period of the Cold War, there have never been such direct threats about the use of nuclear weapons,"" De Croo said. But it is not the first time Moscow has threatened to use nuclear weapons, and Belgium and NATO must maintain their dual response, according to the prime minister: ""Not to be intimidated, but not to throw oil on the fire either"".In an interview, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for new sanctions against Russia, but according to De Croo priority must be given to the rapid disconnection from Russian gas and oil. â€œThat has an impact. At first we thought it would take years, but now it is more a matter of months.â€ In the meantime, Europe must also increase efforts to clarify to the rest of the world that it is not Western sanctions, but Russian aggression at the root of global instability, De Croo concluded. (September 22)Brussels in favor of Slovenia's candidacy for the UN Security CouncilNew York (STA) – The European Commission takes a favorable stance on Slovenia's candidacy for a non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council for the period of 2024-2025, even though the Commission not directly involved in the selection of candidates, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ told STA on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly session in New York.""Slovenia is a member of the European family that would defend the values â€‹â€‹of multilateralism and the UN Charter much better than Belarus, whose regime persecutes dissidents and its own people, while at the same time helping Russia in its outrageous aggression against Ukraine. In fact, Belarus does not deserve membership, and the sympathies of the European Commission are quite clear here,"" stressed European Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ.According to the Slovenian Commissioner, Russia has aggravated the global humanitarian crisis with its attack on Ukraine, which the EU is trying to alleviate, while Moscow is trying to blame the problems on the West or the sanctions that were introduced as a result of the war.""Of course, this is not true in the slightest, because none of the sanctions relates to food, agricultural products or fertilizers and the like,"" LenarÄiÄ asserted in an interview with STA, adding that the Russian attack on Ukraine exacerbated a crisis that had already arisen with the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and other conflicts. (September 21)European Commissioner criticizes a lack of progress in solving Slovakiaâ€™s Roma issueKoÅ¡ice (TASR) – The European Commissioner for Equality, Helena Dalli, sees a lack of improvement in the situation of marginalized Roma communities in Slovakia, despite the available resources from European funds. ""The European Union supplies a lot of funds for this purpose, but we have to see that these funds are used in the right way and really help these communities to improve their lives,"" she said during her visit to eastern Slovakia on September 21.Dalli visited the Roma settlement HabeÅ¡ in eastern Slovakia and discussed with representatives of non-governmental organizations in KoÅ¡ice. Based on her experience, she concluded that many things still need to be changed, despite some progress in areas such as housing and education. ""An important aspect that I still saw is the problem of segregation, where the Roma community is cut off from the rest of society. And that's what we don't want to happen. We talk about the inclusion of the Roma, that's our policy,"" she said.She considers the education of Roma children and adults, as well as good projects, to be essential. ""Without education, it will not be possible to break the vicious circle of poverty,"" she concluded. The European Commissioner pointed out that many children from the settlements are still not attending school. ""At the same time, we would like to see children attending regular and not segregated schools,"" she said. (September 21)Bulgarian Agency BTA becomes seat of the Association of Balkan News AgenciesBurgas (BTA) – Bulgaria becomes the seat of the Association of Balkan News Agencies (ABNA) - Southeastern Europe (SE). The idea to create an Association of Balkan News Agencies arose in September 1994 at a meeting of the representatives of information agencies from the Balkans in Sofia. The first General Assembly of the informal ABNA-UEE took place in June 1995 in Thessaloniki, Greece. The aim of the organization is to enable the development of cooperation between news agencies from the region, as well as to contribute to the establishment of a climate of peace, friendship and cooperation in the Balkans.The director general of the Bulgarian News Agency (BTA), Kiril Valchev, will be the general secretary of the organization with a mandate of three years. This was accepted by a full majority of representatives of news agencies from 11 countries, participants in the 30th ABNA-UEE General Assembly, which BTA hosted in Burgas.The director general of the Greek agency ANA-MPA, Emilios Perdikaris, was elected as the chairman of ABNA-UEE. The next assembly of the Association will take place in Thessaloniki, Greece, in the spring of 2023. The Republic of Turkey will host ABNA-EU in 2024. (September 19)German data retention overturned after ECJ ruling - what's next?Luxembourg/Berlin (dpa) – With its ruling on German data retention, the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) has set clear guidelines for the storage of telecommunications data. Now the German government must decide what a possible successor regulation might look like. The most important questions and answers:What exactly did the ECJ decide?The European Court of Justice actually repeated what it has most frequently said on the subject in recent years: The storage of communications data without any reason – for example, who is calling whom from which location and when – is impermissible. An exception applies in the event of a serious threat to national security. However, the concept of a threat to national security is narrowly defined: As recently as April, the ECJ ruled on data retention in Ireland that serious crimes such as murder are not covered. According to the ruling, IP addresses can be stored – but only to combat serious crimes. The ECJ therefore does not put a definitive stop to data retention.How useful is data retention anyway?In recent years, advocates had argued primarily with the benefits of this instrument for solving cases of sexual child abuse. After all, the IP address of the perpetrator who posts pertinent photos or videos on the Internet and shares them with others is often the only clue for investigators. A large proportion of the investigations into child pornography on the Internet that the German police deal with are triggered by tips from the non-profit child protection organization NCMEC. In three out of four cases, the perpetrator can be identified without warrantless data retention. According to estimates, the success rate would increase to over 90 percent if the investigators had access to automatically stored data from telecommunications companies.How do other EU countries handle data retention?Data retention is a hot potato throughout Europe. Many EU member states use some form of data retention or are drafting legislation to that effect. Regulations have repeatedly ended up before the ECJ in recent years. On September 20, together with the ruling on Germany, the ECJ overturned a regulation from France on data retention for combating market abuse crimes. In April, the ECJ ruled that the Irish scheme was illegal. Two years ago, a Belgian scheme was also declared incompatible with EU law.

Rule of law: What happens after the EU Commission proposed to freeze funds intended for Hungary?,"For the first time since ever the EU Commission has proposed to freeze payments to a member state, in this case Hungary, for violating the rule of law and alleged corruption. Now the member states will have to decide. The European Commission wants to withhold 7.5 billion euros in payments to Hungary because of alleged corruption and rule of law violations, Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said on September 18.""Today's decision is a clear demonstration of the Commission's resolve to protect the EU budget, and to use all tools at our disposal to ensure this important objective,"" said Hahn.Various EU bodies have accused Viktor Orban of dismantling democracy in Hungary as well as overlooking pervasive corruption and disregarding the rule of law. This is the first time the commission has attempted to take the step of cutting off funding due to concerns about rule of law problems in a member state.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen started the process of restricting funding in April of this year by using a rule of law mechanism – also dubbed conditionality mechanism – that was implemented in 2021 to ensure that EU members adhere to the blocâ€™s general principles. A key condition for drawing the mechanism is the conviction that EU funds are being misused.Hungary has shown some willingness to tackle the problem, including announcing an independent authority to monitor the use of EU funds. Budapest might still avoid the freezing of its funds if it eliminates the reasons that prompted the proposal before the expiration of the deadline. The EU Commission has said this might work, but needs to be implemented properly.The freezing of funds must now be approved within one month by a qualified majority of the Member States. However, by member statesâ€™ decision, the deadline can be extended for another two months. In order to block the funds, a majority of 15 EU countries representing 65 percent of the EUâ€™s population would have to approve the plan. How did the EU states react? Poland supports HungaryWarsaw assured on September 18 that it would oppose â€œany moveâ€ by Brussels to deprive Hungary of the 7.5 billion euros of European funding.â€œPoland will strongly oppose any move by the European institutions to deprive a member country, in this case Hungary, of funds in an absolutely unauthorized manner,â€ declared Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to the press.The head of the Polish nationalist-populist government, also in conflict with Brussels, which accuses him of not respecting the rule of law, recalled that his Hungarian counterpart and ally Viktor Orban had already prepared â€œa plan for agreement with the European Commission.â€Hungary plays role in Italian election campaignFor Italian far-right leader Giorgia Meloni, tipped for victory in the September 25 general election in Italy, there is an issue of sovereignty here, which sooner or later will have to be addressed. ""European decision-making bodies are governing bodies,"" she explained on September 18. ""We say that sovereignty belongs to the people and manifests itself in parliamentary choices. It is a debate that we have to conduct politely, and this does not mean leaving the EU, but giving correctives.""Meloni clarified further, ""Orban will make his choices, but I do not do what Orban says, I only have the Italian national interest in mind."" However, ""I do not agree with what the EU is doing with Hungary. We are in the midst of a war against the West. We are not interested in splitting Europe, but in uniting Europe more strongly against its adversaries. At the UN assembly, Hungary did not vote with Russia, but with Europe. And Poland is in the front line of the clash with Russia, and is taking on refugees from Ukraine.""Meloni is campaigning for the election as part of a right-wing coalition that includes Matteo Salvini's far-right League party and Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia. The last polls published before a pre-election blackout put the alliance on course to take 46 percent of the vote, well ahead of its rivals.The leader of the Democratic Party  (Partito Democratico/PD) Enrico Letta sharply emphasized his distance to the center-right alliance. ""We do not want an Italy that binds itself to Hungary as Salvini today proposed to do,"" he explained on. ""We do not want an Italy that winks at Orban and Putin, we want an Italy that is in the heart of Europe and is faithful to its alliances.""Slovakia and Croatia prefer settlementThe European Commission acts as agreed by the EU member states when it approves the EU budget for seven years, stated Slovakian Prime Minister Eduard Heger on the Commissionâ€™s proposal. Heger pointed out that, when approving the EU budget, the conditionality of the rule of law was adopted to help combat the abuse of EU funds in member states. â€œThis is, after all, a long-term priority for my government. Slovakia knows very well from its own experience in the days of former governments what it means to steal EU funds,â€ he said.He also noted that communication between Hungary and the EU Commission on the set of measures that Hungary is prepared to take to strengthen structures for protecting EU funds is very intense at present. Consequently, there is no need to suspend Hungaryâ€™s drawdown of the funds. â€œOf course, this is the preferred scenario,â€ he stated.According to him, the proposal cannot be vetoed. Heger recalled that a qualified majority of EU member states will decide on the final version of the proposal after the expiry of the one-month period. Slovakia is ready to support the extension for another two months in order to give Hungary more time to negotiate, Heger said.""Croatia supports all mechanisms for the protection of the rule of law, including this one on conditionality,"" Andreja Metelko ZgombiÄ‡ , Croatiaâ€™s State Secretray for Europe, said in Brussels, where she attended a meeting of the General Affairs Council on September 20. She would like Brussels and Budapest to settle their dispute through agreement. Budapest could avoid sanctions if it eliminated the reasons that prompted this proposal in due time. ""We were glad to hear that the Commission and Hungary have agreed on a time frame to address this matter, which might last two months at most, and that there is room for agreement. We would like to see these preventive mechanisms work and achieve their purpose,"" Metelko ZgombiÄ‡ said.Romanian President Iohannis: â€œAny drastic measure must be well-discussed and well-foundedâ€With regard to the proposal, â€œRomania's perspective is that any drastic measure must be well-discussed and well-founded,â€ Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said on September 20.  â€œMy hope â€¦ is still that communication channels between Brussels and Budapest and solutions to these problems are found, because otherwise fronts are hardening, the dissent increases – and I don't think anyone wants new crises to occur inside the European Union that simply cannot bring anything good. I hope to continue on the path of dialogue on this topic as well,"" Iohannis said in New York.Austria doesnâ€™t want compromises on rule of lawAustrian European Affairs Minister Karoline Edtstadler (Austrian People's Party, Ã–VP) took a wait-and-see approach after the EU Commission's proposal. Budapest has already presented reform steps and a plan, Edtstadler said on September 20 before the meeting with her EU counterparts in Brussels. Now, she said, it is a matter of how the Czech presidency deals with the EU Commission's idea. ""What is important to me is that there must be no compromise on the rule of law,"" Edtstadler further stressed. There is a ""clear procedure"", the Austrian People's Party minister said, adding that ""everyone should also be given the chance to present their ideas and concepts in this procedure and to return to the path of the rule of law."" During the same meeting she said she would also hold talks with Hungarian Justice Minister Judit Varga. And what does Hungary say?â€œThe summer was a very constructive and solution-oriented period and thatâ€™s why Hungary proposed 17 measures, which are capable of remedying all the concerns within the conditionality procedure, and this was also approved by the European Commission on Sunday,â€ Hungarian Minister of Justice, Judit Varga said on September 20 in Brussels. â€œSo Hungary is now fully committed to implement these measures,â€ she added, arriving at the General Affairs Council in Brussels.Varga said Hungary should have time until mid-November, as the country has â€œto set up new institutions, for that you have to hire new personnelâ€. She also pointed out that legislation was required and asked the other member states to be tolerant, positive and constructive.The 17 Hungarian proposals focus mainly on the control of tenders and the use of EU funds, including the creation of an independent authority that would oversee the application of the rules for the use of EU money.Hungary will also reduce the proportion of tenders with only one bidder, and the government promises to make it easier for SMEs to participate in tenders, and to cooperate more closely with OLAF, the European anti-fraud office.On September 20, proposed legislation to address some of the EU's allegations of corruption was presented to Hungary's lawmakers.The proposed measure would set controls on the activities of politicians who have taken seats on foundations' boards of trustees and would require Hungarian officials to cooperate more widely with OLAF.The new proposals were first announced on the Hungarian Parliament's website late on September 19. Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government has announced that another legislative proposal is set to be presented on September 23.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Italy's election results, energy partnership between Germany and the United Arab Emirates and EU works on joint handling of Russian fugitives","Europe reacts to the Italian election outcome. Amid the energy crisis, Germany is expected to receive its first shipment of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United Arab Emirates by the end of 2022. Further news: The parliament of the Republic of North Macedonia continues discussions on the energy crisis and the EU works on joint handling of Russian fugitives.Italy plunges into the unknown after the victory of Giorgia MeloniRome (AFP) – On September 26, a period of uncertainty started for Italy and the European Union, following the victory in the Italian legislative elections of Giorgia Meloni, who leads a right-wing/far-right coalition. The coalition will face considerable challenges.With an absolute majority in Parliament, Meloni, leader of Fratelli d'Italia party (post-fascist), will try to form a government in the coming days with allies Matteo Salvini of the League (anti-immigration) and Silvio Berlusconi of Forza Italia (right-wing).In her first statement after the vote, Giorgia Meloni was keen to reassure, both in Italy and abroad. French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne warned that France would be ""attentive"" to ""respect"" for human rights and the right to abortion. Showing more concern, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs said that ""populism always ends in disaster"", because ""its answer is always the same: let's close ourselves off and go back to the pastâ€. (September 26)New energy supplier: Germany receives liquefied natural gas from the EmiratesGerman chancellor Olaf Scholz at Doha airport. After Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, Qatar was the last stop on the trip. Photo: Kay Nietfeld/dpaAbu Dhabi (dpa) – Germany is to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United Arab Emirates as a replacement for energy supplies from Russia. On September 25, energy company RWE, during a visit of German chancellor Olaf Scholz to the gulf state, signed a contract for an initial delivery of 137,000 cubic meters of LNG. It is expected to arrive in December of this year and will be the first shipment to the new LNG terminal in BrunsbÃ¼ttel near Hamburg. According to RWE, a memorandum has been signed for multi-year deliveries starting in 2023.For comparison: According to the operator of the pipeline, prior to the aggression on Ukraine, gas with an energy volume of approximately 1.76 billion kilowatt hours flowed through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline on February 1 alone. The first delivery of 137,000 cubic meters of liquefied natural gas for RWE from the United Arab Emirates equals approximately 0.95 billion kilowatt hours.During his visit, Scholz announced his intention to further advance cooperation with the Emirates in the energy sector. The German chancellor said in Abu Dhabi that ""a whole series"" of diesel and liquid gas projects had already been advanced with the gulf state. In terms of energy supply, he added, it was necessary to distribute the demand among as many suppliers as possible. Dependence on one supplier ""will certainly not happen to us again"", Scholz stressed. According to Sunday's agreement, state-owned Emirati company ADNOC is also to supply up to 250,000 metric tons of diesel fuel a month to Germany from 2023. The agreement on this was concluded with energy company Hoyer. (September 25)North Macedonia's assembly continues to discuss the energy crisisSkopje (MIA) – The session of the Parliamentary Commission for Defense and Security continues in the week of September 26 in the assembly of the Republic of North Macedonia, with two proposals related to the energy crisis on the agenda. After the discussion in the home affairs committee, parliament is expected to vote for the extension of the state of emergency in the energy sector by another six months on September 28. The state of emergency has been in force since the government decision of September 1. According to the government, declaring a state of emergency will set off mechanisms to deal with the crisis. Meanwhile, opposition party VMRO-DPMNE believes that the reasons for North Macedonia's electricity crisis are non-domestic operations and reduced electricity production. (September 26)Ukraine: EU works on joint handling of Russian fugitivesBrussels (APA) – The question of how to deal with Russians fleeing the partial mobilization is preoccupying the European Union. ""This is an unprecedented situation, we are looking at it from a security point of view,"" said an EU Commission spokeswoman in Brussels on September 22. She stressed that concrete decisions on visa matters are partly in the hands of the individual EU member states.The EU Commission spokeswoman evaded the question of whether there will be a different solution for Russians fleeing the draft. Border management, she said, must be carried out by EU member states in accordance with international and European rules. The Schengen Code allows refusal of entry for security reasons. The EU Commission is currently in contact with EU states to monitor the situation, she said, adding that the Commission supports them and is trying to ""prepare the next stepâ€.Since the outbreak of the war, however, the Commission spokesperson said, half a million people have fled Russia and found their place in Europe or elsewhere. The spokeswoman also pointed out that EU law offers protection to people who ask for asylum. But each case is examined individually at the borders, she said. EU states were working on a common approach. About ten days ago, EU countries agreed to raise the hurdles for granting Schengen visas to Russians. The visas are now more expensive across the EU and the application process takes longer. The Schengen area includes 22 EU countries plus Switzerland and three other states.On Wednesday, Austrian Federal President Alexander Van der Bellen suggested a humanitarian commitment, including for Russian citizens. ""We are a safe place for people from Ukraine, and we should also be for Russians who are forced to leave their homeland now,"" he said. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Ã–VP) said on the Austrian news program ZiB2 that he was clearly against a visa ban for Russians. Austrians in particular should be able to ""distinguish between Putin and his henchmen and the Russian peopleâ€.According to the Austrian Federal Ministry of the Interior, 160 persons from the Russian Federation (84 men and 76 women) have been granted protection in Austria this year.

"Europe in brief: Nord Stream leaks, EU warns, Moscow denies suspicions","EU warns concerning the Nord Stream leaks, Moscow denies suspicions. - Belgium and 14 other EU countries push for a proposal for a general gas price cap. What else was important this week: More than 77 percent of Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s (BiH) citizens want membership in the EU. Nord Stream leaks: EU warns, Moscow denies suspicionsCopenhagen (AFP) – On September 28, the EU warned against any attack targeting its energy infrastructure. After leaks on the Nord Stream gas pipelines under the Baltic Sea were described as â€œsabotageâ€ by Europeans, Moscow deemed it â€œstupidâ€ to suspect Russia. â€œAny deliberate disruption of European energy infrastructure is completely unacceptable and will be met with a vigorous and united response,â€ said EU Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell. The information available at this stage indicates that the leaks caused by explosions on these underwater installations linking Russia to Germany are the result of a ""deliberate act"", added the European official in a statement on behalf of the 27 member states of the EU.Moscow, for its part, challenged the ""quite predictable"" suspicions expressed against it by certain capitals, claiming they were ""stupid and absurd"". The leaks affecting Nord Stream 1 and 2 were ""problematic"" for Moscow, because the Russian gas that escapes ""is very expensive"", argued Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. On September 27, Russia said it was ""extremely concerned"", believing that no hypothesis, including sabotage, should not be excluded. (September 28, 2022)Belgium and 14 other EU countries push for a proposal for a general gas price capBrussels (Belga) – Fifteen European member states, including Belgium, want the European Commission to submit a proposal this week for the introduction of a general price cap for gas, so that the energy ministers can discuss it at their emergency meeting on Friday. A European price cap for gas has been discussed for several weeks. The Commission proposed its â€œemergency interventionâ€ in the energy market on September 14 to drive down prices, but a proposal for a price cap was not part of that. The energy ministers had asked the Commission to examine a general cap – on all gas imported into Europe – but that work is still not finished. Belgium is one of the member states that is pushing hardest for the introduction of such a general cap, but other countries and the Commission invariably warn about the security of supply and consider a cap solely on Russian gas imports to be more workable.Three days before the 27 energy ministers meet again to discuss the price crisis in the energy sector, 15 member states have sent a letter to Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson, urging him to submit a proposal for the introduction of a general price cap for gas. This could already serve as a basis for discussions in the energy council. Belga was able to view the letter to the Commission in the evening of September 27. The countries argue that a general price cap ""can be designed in such a way as to ensure security of supply and the free flow of gas in Europe, while continuing to meet our target of reducing gas demand"".Belgium, Greece and Italy were the main proponents of this letter, it is said. They eventually brought on board Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark in particular were not won over by the idea of a general price cap. A price cap must be approved by a so-called qualified majority. Together, the fifteen countries that have signed the letter will need the support of at least one other member state. (September 27)77.4 percent of citizens support Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s membership in the EUSarajevo (FENA) – In the event of a referendum on membership in the European Union, 77.4 percent of the respondents would vote for the entry of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the EU, according to the latest survey by the Directorate for European Integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Research on support for the accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the EU, and on topics related to European integration that interest the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was conducted in August 2022 on a sample of 1,200 respondents representative of the entire country.As reasons for their support, respondents most frequently cite a guarantee of permanent peace and political stability (34.4 percent), freedom of movement of people, goods and capital (32 percent) and compliance with laws and regulations (22.8 percent). 50.4 percent of the respondents who do not support BiH's entry into the EU cite fear of higher living costs and taxes as their most common reason.According to the opinion of 49.9 percent of respondents, young people will benefit the most from BiH's entry into the EU. 39.1 percent believe that the politicization of the process will be the greatest challenge for the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina into the EU, while for 27.9 percent, an unwillingness to change appears to be the greatest obstacle. According to 49 percent of respondents, the fight against corruption is the most necessary reform to improve the daily life of citizens in BiH, followed by the reduction of tax burdens (17.2 percent), and the reform of courts and prosecutorsâ€™ offices (14.5 percent).A total of 48 percent of respondents think that BiH's European path has no alternative, while 44.8 percent think that it has. 35.3 percent of the respondents believe that Bosnia and Herzegovina will never join the EU, while 34.7 percent believe that the accession will take no more than 10 years. 15.4 percent reckon it will take a maximum of 15 years and 14.6 percent expect 20 years at the most.

Bosnia and Herzegovina's unity and sovereignty are crucial to regional stability,"Ahead of the elections on October 2, Bosnia and Herzegovina faces internal problems, but its parties agree on at least one strategic issue: They see the future of the country in the EU. However, they remain divided on how the country should be shaped on its path to the EU. Due to the countryâ€™s internal instability, but also the strong influence of Russia on the Serbian entity, the elections play an important role for regional and even European stability.Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is the country with the most complicated internal organization in Europe. This is a consequence of the Dayton Peace Agreement, which ended the war in 1995, but also left behind a number of complex issues that have not been resolved to this day. An integral part of that peace agreement is Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s present constitution.The country has three constituent peoples (Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats) and two entities, the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska (RS). A third, smaller area, the BrÄko District, operates under a special status. Most responsibilities are distributed between the entities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of ten federal units, called the Cantons, each with its own government and responsibilities. The most important decisions are taken by authorities at this lower level of government. There are also 143 municipalities in BiH: 63 in the RS and 80 in the Federation.On Sunday, October 2, general elections will be held, where 3.3 million citizens with the right to vote will elect three members of the BiH Presidency, as well as representatives for the state, entity and cantonal parliaments. Due to the different arrangement of the entities, the president and two vice-presidents of that entity will be elected in the RS, while the heads of the entities of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be elected indirectly by the parliament after its constitution.BiHâ€™s elections come at a point in time where the political situation is rather complicated. Negotiations between key political actors on electoral reform failed. As a result, elections are held according to a law that – as both European and domestic courts have determined – discriminates against ethnic minorities, as well as – in certain administrative units – against members of constituent peoples. Additional political and inter-ethnic tensions are caused by the problem of proportional representation of Croats as the smallest of the three constituent peoples.The role of the High RepresentativeFurthermore, the High Representative of the international community in BiH, the German politician Christian Schmidt, has the option to use his powers and impose certain legal solutions for the post-election formation of the government. Since 1995, a High Representative approved by the UN Security Council is supposed to guarantee peace and stability in BiH. He can dismiss elected representatives and intervene in legislation. Since August 2021, the post has been held by Schmidt, whom the RS leadership does not recognize, because Moscow wanted to abolish the position and Schmidt was thus not approved by the UN Security Council.Schmidt had announced that he was going to make use of his powers ahead of the election, but in the face of a wave of criticism, he gave up the imposition for the time being. In any case: Due to the complicated system, it is certain that the government will have to be formed by three or more parties at both the state and lower levels.Croatia pushes for electoral reformIn neighboring Croatia, the elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are followed with great interest. Addressing the UN General Assembly on September 24, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ called on the international community's High Representative to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt, to exert his powers and impose an electoral reform that would ensure the equality of Croats in the October 2 general elections.Speaking to the press later, PlenkoviÄ‡ said it was not too late for that, and claims that it was â€œthe narrative of those who want the status quo"", which was ""clear as dayâ€. He was alluding to Bosniak leader Bakir IzetbegoviÄ‡, saying that IzetbegoviÄ‡ ""publicly said"" that he ""pretended to be negotiating"" while doing everything so that there was no progress in talks on electoral reforms. ""It's not fair to pretend to be negotiating for two years and then say â€˜It's too late nowâ€™,"" PlenkoviÄ‡ said. ""I think it's fair to fix what can be fixed.""Consensus on becoming part of the EUDepending on the dominant ethnic affiliation of their membership, parties in BiH have different views on most strategic issues for the future of the country. One of the rare issues where there is a formal consensus is joining the European Union. During the political campaigns in the pre-election period, it has been evident that almost every party program includes the goal â€œprogress of Bosnia and Herzegovina towards membership in the European Unionâ€. But even though everyone has declared to be in favor of this, not much has been done to meet the demands outlined in the 14 priorities of â€œOpinions of the European Commissionâ€, which are a prerequisite for obtaining candidate status.The latest research conducted by the Directorate for European Integration showed that in the event of a referendum on EU membership, 77.4 percent of citizens would vote for joining the EU, and 48 percent of respondents think that there is no alternative to BiH's European path. It is noticeable that there is significantly less support for joining the EU among respondents in the RS entity, where Serbs predominantly live. Unlike Bosniaks and Croats, Serbs are generally opposed to BiH's membership in the NATO, and all Serbian political parties advocate BiH's neutrality in the Ukrainian-Russian conflict and harmonization of BiH's policy on this issue with Serbia.Taking up Macron's idea of a ""European Political Community""Although Bosnia and Herzegovina has not yet been granted EU candidate status, it has recently been invited, together with 16 other non-EU countries, to join the European Political Community. The political gathering is the brainchild of French President Emmanuel Macron and aims to facilitate closer exchange between EU countries and those outside the bloc, whether by choice or because they do not currently meet membership criteria. The new European political forum will take place in Prague on October 6.Macron has said he hopes to be able to use the gathering to improve cooperation with the EU's partners in Europe, referring to Ukraine, which was recently granted official EU candidate status, but is unlikely to become a full member of the bloc for at least another decade. Critics have called the forum a consolation prize for failure to join the EU. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently backed the European Political Community, but said it ""should not be an alternative to EU enlargementâ€.Evolution or break-up – which way will BiH go?It remains to be seen if Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s system can evolve. For now, none of the three communities agree which future development would be desirable. This has recently led to one of the most serious political crises since the end of the war, with secession threats from Serbian entity leaders.â€œIt is the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina who have the most important role in shaping the future of their country. We strongly encourage the citizens of BiH to participate in the upcoming elections on 2 October as the outcome will determine also their future and the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina.""Peter Stano, EU Commission's Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy""All political actors in Bosnia and Herzegovina must work together to ensure free, fair and inclusive elections. As agreed in theÂ Political Agreement of 12 JuneÂ in Brussels, the EU expects all political actors to cooperate to swiftly set up legislatures and governments at State, entity and cantonal level, after the elections, in order to focus on reforms on the EU path.Â The EU path of Bosnia and Herzegovina is open – but it requires the country and its elected leaders to deliver on reforms,â€ said EU Commission's Spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Peter Stano on the upcoming elections.

"British meteorologist falsely blames climate change on sun, moon","In a video viewed more than two million times on Twitter, British meteorologist Piers Corbyn claims lunar and solar phases -- not carbon dioxide emissions -- are driving climate change. This is false; experts told AFP that scientific consensus indicates human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary reason for global warming.""Ooopsâ€¦ this interview definitely didnâ€™t go as plannedâ€¦ The climate cultists are going to hate this..."" says a September 9, 2022 tweet shared more than 25,000 times.The post includes a clip of a Corbyn interview with Russia Today (RT), a media outlet which has been linked to Moscow's ""disinformation and propaganda ecosystem.""""Climate has always been changing, but this has nothing to do with man,"" Corbyn says in the video, adding that several ""very hot summers"" in a row have ""nothing to do with carbon dioxide.""Screenshot of a tweet taken September 27, 2022The clip was shared on YouTube, where it was later removed, and in climate-skeptical groups and pages on Facebook. The video circulated online, including in French, following heat waves in Europe in summer 2022.Corbyn has made several appearances on RT, a Russian state-owned television network, over the years. The clip shared on Twitter is not new -- it aired in early August 2010.Several scientists told AFP Corbyn's claims about the cause of global warming do not make scientific sense.""Scientists have worked very hard to rule out all other possibilities. It is not the variability of the sun. It has nothing to do with the sun or the moon,"" said Travis Rector, an astronomer at the University of Alaska-Anchorage. ""And the only explanation that is possible is the addition of these greenhouse gases through human activity.""Conspiracy theoriesPiers Corbyn is the brother of UK politician and former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn. The former has spread false claims about climate change for decades.He obtained a degree in physics from Imperial College London in 1968, as well as a postgraduate degree in astrophysics from Queen Mary College in 1981. However, he is not a climate scientist and has very little related scientific research or peer-reviewed papers to his name, AFP found.On his weather forecast platform WeatherAction, Corbyn presents climate change as ""propaganda."" And in recent years, he has shared conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic, health and safety measures, and vaccines.Piers Corbyn, brother of former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, speaks to the media as he leaves an anti-vaccine demonstration that had been held outside the offices of the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation in central London on November 24, 2020 ( AFP / Justin Tallis)In a March 2020 tweet, Corbyn falsely claimed the health crisis was a ""simulation"" by ""mega-rich control freaks"" Bill Gates and George Soros.In February 2021, he was arrested for comparing vaccination to the Holocaust, according to The GuardianGlobal warming and solar activityDuring his interview on RT, Corbyn claimed ""circulation patterns"" related to ""solar activity"" and ""certain stages of the moon"" are primary drivers of climate change. The sun can influence Earthâ€™s climate, but experts told AFP it is not the primary cause of global warming.Christopher Merchant, professor of ocean and Earth observation at the University of Reading, said ""circulation patterns"" refer to ""the way in which air moves around the planet.""""A circulation pattern is a meteorologistâ€™s way of describing a weather or seasonal event from the point of view of the atmosphere,"" he said.But the phrase ""isnâ€™t an explanation of anything"" related to climate change, Merchant said.Rector of the University of Alaska-Anchorage told AFP scientists ""definitively"" know the addition of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and methane to the atmosphere ""primarily through the use of fossil fuels"" is responsible for global warming.""It is contributing to the extreme weather events, like the flooding in western Alaska and in Puerto Rico and the heat waves that have been occurring throughout Europe,"" he said. ""And we also know that there is no other way to explain it.""More than just natureSkeptics on social media often describe climate change as a ""natural"" phenomenon. But according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), human activity is causing global warming by ""amplifying Earthâ€™s natural greenhouse effect.""""Virtually all climate scientists agree that this increase in heat-trapping gases is the main reason for the 1.8Â°F (1.0Â°C) rise in global average temperature since the late nineteenth century,"" the agency says.The warming observed in recent decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earthâ€™s orbit and too large to be caused by solar activity, according to NOAA.Atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and methane monthly, since 2003 ( AFP)""In the industrial era, human activities have been, and are increasingly, the dominant cause of climate warming,"" the agency says online. ""The increase in radiative forcing due to these activities has far exceeded the relatively small net increase due to natural factors, which include changes in energy from the sun and the cooling effect of volcanic eruptions.""Extreme weather events have always existed, but they are getting worse. Heat waves, for example, occur more frequently because of human-induced global warming, as seen in these graphics from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).""There have been instances of extreme heat waves throughout history, but when we look at the broader trend over the past century, we can see that global average temperatures have been steadily increasing, and heat waves are becoming more frequent and more intense as the global baseline temperature goes up,"" said Maren Hale, a climate researcher at the University of California-San Diego's Scripps Institution of Oceanography.Scientific consensusThe best estimate of human-induced warming is 1.07 degrees Celsius, according to the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). More than 700 scientists from 90 different countries assemble the report.Naomi Oreskes, a geologist, science historian and professor at Harvard University, was a pioneer in defining scientific consensus on climate change and human activity. In 2004, she conducted an analysis of 928 peer-reviewed abstracts published between 1993 and 2003.""Remarkably, none of the papers disagreed with the consensus position,"" she wrote at the time.Multiple studies have since corroborated her findings.

"Europe in brief: European leaders set to meet in Prague, EU agrees windfall tax on energy companies, protests in Bratislava against Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories","Fears of high energy bills for households have led EU energy ministers to agree on windfall levies on energy companies. Later this week two strategic summits will take place in Prague: the first will be held together with 17 non-EU nations, followed by an informal summit to discuss the war in Ukraine.EU leaders face 'most pressing' issues of war in UkraineBrussels/Copenhagen (EFE) – Next Friday, EU leaders will head to Prague to discuss ""the three most pressing issues"" facing the bloc: ""Russia's war in Ukraine, energy and the economic situation,"" European Council President Charles Michel said in his invitation letter to the informal summit, in which he also called for member states to look at ""how best to protect our critical infrastructure.""The invitation comes in the wake of four recent leaks on Russia's Nord Stream pipelines, which according to the Danish authorities stopped leaking gas on Sunday. The EU, the US, and Russia have spoken of sabotage but disagree on who is responsible. Moscow accused â€œAnglo-Saxonsâ€ of being behind the sabotage, whereas some Western countries blamed Russia. Before that meeting, the first summit of the European Political Community, the new political grouping made up of the 27 EU member states and 17 other neighboring countries, such as Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Switzerland, and the Balkan states, will be held in Prague on Thursday. (October 2 and 3)Demonstrators protested outside the Russian Embassy in Bratislava against the annexation of Ukrainian territories Bratislava (TASR) – Protests against the annexation of Ukrainian territories by the Russian Federation took place in front of the Russian Embassy in Bratislava on Friday. Organizers of the Peace in Ukraine initiative called on democratic countries to speed up aid to Ukraine. ""The attempt to steal parts of Ukraine's territory is a brutal attack on international law, on the elementary principles on which the United Nations is based,"" Marek Kapusta, a founding member of Peace in Ukraine, said in a statement. He stressed that a country that commits such acts must not be a member of the UN Security Council. According to the initiative, helping Ukraine is the only way to end the war as soon as possible. (October 1)Energy companies must pay for relief for citizensBrussels (dpa) – In the EU, energy companies will be asked to pay to relieve households and businesses in the face of rising prices. On Friday, EU energy ministers approved a package of emergency measures, which sets binding targets for cutting electricity use. It also stipulates that a number of electricity producers and oil and gas companies will need to contribute excess revenue to the state. This money will be used to relieve the burden on consumers and companies. Germany was criticized for rejecting a Europe-wide price cap on gas.Germanyâ€™s Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck warned of supply bottlenecks if an EU-wide price cap on gas was introduced. ""That is why we need another solution, a better solution."" Germany and the Netherlands are among those opposed to the majority of EU states calling for a cap on the price of gas, both for wholesale and for imports. Italy, France, Spain, and Belgium have all endorsed a cap. Italy, for example, criticizes that some countries do not have enough funds to put together large national relief packages. Therefore, an EU-wide solution is needed.Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela, who chairs the Council of Ministers, also said that after Friday's decisions, others would have to follow. ""This is only the first piece of the puzzle."" He said the states had asked the EU Commission to come up with proposals for further measures. EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson also said market intervention at EU level was needed to bring down prices for consumers. But she warned against drastic interventions such as a price cap on European wholesale gas transactions. ""This would clearly have an effect on prices, but would also effectively mean the suspension of the EU's gas market and create risks to security of supply.""Various options are now to be discussed. The EU Commission is expected to make more concrete proposals before the summit of heads of state and government this week. It is expected that Friday's agreement will be formally approved this week. The measures will then come into force in December. (September 30)EU to Russians: Visa no longer enough to be granted entryBrussels (ANSA) – As of today, the EU is introducing new guidelines for member states, specifying that a valid Schengen visa will no longer be sufficient for Russian nationals to be granted entry to the EU. ""Additional security checks"" will be required of border guards. As a result, Russians will only be able to obtain Schengen visas for no more than 90 days and additional security checks are recommended in all cases.

"Europe in brief: Majority of Austrians is in favor of EU support for Ukraine, Bulgaria expects a decision on Schengen, new European Political Community has started with first meeting in Prague, Slovenian Foreign Minister Fajon: Slovenia is hesitant about Ukraine joining NATO","According to a recent survey, a majority of Austrians back a unified EU line in support of Ukraine. Bulgaria expects a decision on Schengen in December, the EP gives strong support. What else was important this week: Leaders of more than 40 European countries gather in Prague for the first meeting of the European Political Community. According to Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, Slovenia is hesitant about Ukraine joining NATO due to the significant security risks.Majority of Austrians back EU support for UkraineVienna (APA) - According to a recent survey by the Austrian Society for European Politics (Ã–GfE), a majority of Austrians back a unified EU line in support of Ukraine. 29 percent of respondents stated that the sanctions against Russia should be tightened further. 20 percent consider the measures taken by the EU so far to be sufficient. About a quarter (26 percent) consider the measures too harsh, and another quarter are unsure.According to the survey conducted from 26 to 28 September, 30 percent of Austrians consider it ""very important"" and 25 percent ""rather important"" that the EU member states take a unified line in their support for Ukraine. For 13 percent of respondents this is ""rather not important"" and for 14 percent ""not at all important."" Just under a fifth did not comment on this (18 percent). ""The number of those who want to maintain or expand sanctions against Russia is higher than those who want to reduce or reverse them,"" Ã–GfE Secretary General Paul Schmidt explained when analyzing the results.""The worsening geopolitical situation, fear of energy shortages and inflation are causing increasing uncertainty in Austria. A majority of the population nevertheless considers it important that the EU continues to pursue a unified line in its support for Ukraine."" Ã–GfE Secretary General Paul SchmidtSchmidt considers it important to ""counter the growing concerns with transparent and fact-based communication."" Although the EU's measures are only decisively questioned by a minority in Austria,"" many are nevertheless uncertain about whether and when the measures will have an effect. However, sanctions take time and will ultimately hurt Russia more than the EU. Russia is already lacking important technologies and spare parts, and forecasts predict a massive decline in Russia's gross domestic product this year,"" said the Ã–GfE Secretary General.""Unity is Europe's most important trump card in putting a stop to the Russia-Ukraine war,"" Schmidt said. Especially now, he said, the EU must position itself as a community of solidarity and a counter-model to authoritarianism and repression. Attempts to drive a wedge into European unity only benefit Moscow's ambitions.The survey also asked Austrians about their attitudes to the ""European Political Community"", a new format of EU and non-EU states in Europe that will meet for the first time in Prague on October 6 and wants to cooperate more closely in areas such as security and defence, energy, health and the economy. According to the survey, 42 percent of respondents approve of this idea, while 26 percent reject it. A third cannot yet form an opinion on this.The survey was conducted by the Market Institute from 26 to 28 September on behalf of the Ã–GfE. A total of 1,000 people aged between 16 and 80 were interviewed online throughout Austria. The maximum statistical variation is 3.16 percent. (October 6)Bulgaria expects a decision on Schengen in December, EP gives strong supportStrasbourg (BTA) – Czechia, as president of the Council of the EU until the end of this year, will propose a vote in December for the admission of Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia to the Schengen Area. This was announced to the European Parliament in Strasbourg by the representative of the presidency. MEPs from the largest political groups – European Peopleâ€™s Party (liberal conservatives), Socialists and democrats as well as Renew (liberals) and European Conservatives and Reformists (conservatives) strongly supported this proposal, the Greens (center-left) had conditions, while Identity and Democracy (right wing) and The Left (left wing) were opposed. Bulgaria and Romania have been waiting to join Schengen since 2011, when the European Commission (EC) reported their full readiness.The European Parliament had already given its official go for Bulgaria and Romania to join the border control-free Schengen Area in June 2011. The final decision on whether a country can join Schengen must be taken unanimously by the EU governments in the Council.The Schengen Area guarantees free movement to more than 400 million EU citizens, along with non-EU nationals living in the EU or visiting the EU as tourists, exchange students or for business purposes (anyone legally present in the EU). It is a border-free area. Every EU citizen is allowed to travel, work and live in an EU country without special formalities.Next week, the representatives of EC and the EU countries will visit Bulgaria and Romania to make sure that border legislation is being applied. For now, in the Council of the EU, where a unanimous decision is necessary, the Netherlands is still opposed, MEPS announced and called on the government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte not to leave the two countries hostage to domestic political interests again. (October 5)European Political Community sees the light of dayBrussels (Belga) - From Iceland and the United Kingdom, to Turkey and Azerbaijan: On October 6 the leaders of more than 40 European countries gather in Prague for the first meeting of the European Political Community, a new political consultation forum set against the background of the war in Ukraine to promote stability and security in Europe.""The ambition is to bring leaders together on an equal footing and to promote political dialog and cooperation in areas of common interest, so that we work together to strengthen the security, stability and prosperity of all of Europe,"" the European Commission said. Council President Charles Michel set out the plan in his letter of invitation.It was the French President Emmanuel Macron who launched the idea in May. Against the background of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the French president championed a forum in which not only the 27 member states of the European Union, but also other European countries, could reflect together on major strategic issues, such as security, migration, energy and the climate.Some have read Macron's proposal as an attempt to tie Ukraine and other countries aspiring to membership more strongly to the European Union. Indeed, the accession process is a complex and bureaucratic affair that can drag on for many years and even decades and can be very discouraging. These countries are signing up in Prague, even after they have been told that the new forum is certainly not a trap to sidetracking their path to membership. Ukraine is represented by Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, while Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky will take part via video conference.But countries that do not have ambitions to become members, such as Norway, Iceland and Switzerland, also received an invitation. Similarly, the United Kingdom, which more than two years after Brexit seems to want to build a bridge to the continent again, will also be taking part. What's more, the Brits have already offered to organize the second edition of the meeting next year. A total of 44 countries received an invitation. The leaders of the 27 EU member states will remain in Prague on October 7. They will hold an informal summit, with the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis the dominant themes. (October 5)Slovenian Foreign Minister Fajon: Slovenia hesitant about Ukraine joining NATOVitanje/Ljubljana (STA) – Slovenia is hesitant about Ukraine joining NATO due to the major security risks involved, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon told reporters on October 4. ""If NATO were to take a decision to admit Ukraine as member, it could be a clear declaration of the start of war,"" she said on the sidelines of an event in Vitanje, in northeastern Slovenia.Asked about Slovenia's potential support for Ukraine's request to join NATO, Fajon said Slovenia had been helping Ukraine to the best of its abilities in the form of humanitarian, development as well as military aid, which it would continue to do as long as Ukraine needed assistance. The minister said the war in Ukraine was escalating amid concerns that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons, adding that Slovenia had condemned Russia's annexation of Ukrainian territories in the strongest terms. ""This escalation of the situation, and consequently Ukraine's application or Ukraine's talks on NATO membership, are cause for grave concern."" Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja FajonIf NATO was to consider admitting Ukraine it would be a major security risk, therefore Fajon believes serious discussion was needed in the country about ""where such a situation is heading."" Slovenia advocates a policy of peace, dialog, and any such decision-making leads to escalation, which no one wants, she said. Asked whether talks were under way in Slovenia on the issue of Ukraine's membership of NATO, Fajon said Slovenia did not join the statement initiated by Poland last week that indirectly expressed support for Ukraine's membership of NATO. The issue is being discussed today by state secretaries affiliated with the Foreign Ministry and the PM's office, and Fajon discussed the matter with the chair of the parliamentary Foreign Policy Committee in the morning. She announced they would ""sit down together this week to talk through several open issues in relation to Russia and the escalation of the war in Ukraine.""

"Germany’s “double whammy” draws criticism in the EU
","Amid soaring energy prices the EU member states are still looking for a way out. While struggling to find a united answer, Germany has proposed national measures worth up to 200 billion euros. A move that has sparked criticism and calls for unity in the European Union.  The German government has announced a gas price cap to protect consumers from soaring energy bills resulting from the fallout of Russia's war in Ukraine. The three-party coalition consisting of  the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD), the Greens and pro-business Free Democrats (FDP)  is planning a subsidy package worth between 150 and 200 billion euros. The fund is to be repurposed from the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF), which was originally set up to cushion the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the economy. The German government will devise measures to shore up the finances of gas importers that are struggling to pay for energy that is no longer being provided by Russia. German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, described these measures to secure the country's energy supply and a cap on the price of gas as a ""double whammy"" to propel Germany through the energy crisis.A â€œdouble whammyâ€ that has sparked criticism as other EU countries might not have the means to fund similar measures.Criticism from other member statesThe first fierce reaction came from Rome. â€œFaced with the common threats of our times, we cannot be divided according to national budgets,â€ said the Italian prime minister, Mario Draghi, in a thinly veiled criticism of Berlinâ€™s announcements, calling on Europeans to â€œshow unity.â€The Slovenian government said it closely monitors and analyzes all measures of countries that are Slovenia's economic partners, and on this basis adopts its own measures to help the economy. Given that Germany is Slovenia's main foreign trade partner, the economic measures taken by the German government are also of great importance to the stability of Slovenian companies that have links with the German market (e.g. the car industry and other sectors), the Government Communication Office stressed in a written statement to the STA on October 5.On October 3, finance ministers also sent messages about the need for the bloc to act together. Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem said: ""The European project is built on solidarity, is built on working together, on coordination."" French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire called for more targeted support and a better alignment of measures taken by national governments to avoid a ""fragmentation of the euro area.""Every EU member state has the right to adopt measures in line with its fiscal possibilities and needs, but in doing so the integrity of the single market should be taken into account, Croatian Finance Minister Marko Primorac said in Luxembourg on October 4. Germanyâ€™s finance minister defends the measures""We are not stimulating the economy, what we are doing is softening the blow of ruinous price peaks,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said on October 3. The aid package would be proportionate to the size of the German economy, Lindner said, describing it as a ""protective shield.""EU Commission is ""vigilant""The German measures have opened up discussions concerning their impact on the European internal market. â€œThe Commission will be vigilant about the impact of this (Berlin) initiative on the conditions of fair competition,â€ the European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, said in an response to AFP on September 30.Speaking to EFE on October 5, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, also warned that the German measures could ""generate a problem of cohesion in the European internal market."" Borrell added, â€œwe have to maintain the functioning of the internal market and avoid distortions of competition, without a doubt.""Is a price cap the answer?Germany is one of the main opponents of capping wholesale gas prices, which is being advocated by more than half of EU member states. Germanyâ€™s Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck warned on September 30 of supply bottlenecks if an EU-wide price cap on gas was introduced. â€œThat is why we need another solution, a better solution.â€ Germany and the Netherlands are among those opposed to the majority of EU states calling for a cap on the price of gas, both for wholesale and for imports. Italy, France, Spain, and Belgium have all endorsed a cap.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen joined in on the debate October 5. Temporarily capping the price of gas - along with negotiating prices with gas suppliers and joint purchases - should bring down energy prices in the European Union, the President said.  ""Introducing a cap on gas overall is a temporary solution"" and should be ""designed properly to ensure security of supply,"" von der Leyen said at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France.As a first step, the price of gas used to generate electricity could be capped, von der Leyen said. ""But I think we also have to have a look at gas prices beyond the electricity market.""Limiting gas prices should help in reducing price volatility, she noted, without providing additional details on the design of the proposed price caps.New joint debts?The Commissioner for the Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, suggested on October 4 the creation of a new common fund financed by joint debt instruments aimed at accelerating the energy transition and avoiding ""fragmentation"" between member states of the bloc in their responses to the crisis.""If we want to avoid fragmentation, if we want to tackle this crisis, we need a higher level of solidarity and to implement common tools,"" he said upon his arrival at the meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg.In particular, the EU Economy Commissioner proposed taking inspiration from the 100 billion common fund against unemployment that the bloc created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, dubbed SURE, whose aid is channeled to EU partners in the form of loans.However, the European Commission's Vice-President, Valdis Dombrovskis, limited himself to pointing out the ""divergences"" that exist between member states when asked about the suggestion of his two colleagues. Gentiloni and Breton launched the joint debt proposal on October 3.The German Finance Minister, Christian Lindner, said that his country is in favor of measures at a European level such as joint energy purchases or making changes to the gas market, but considered that ""the instruments that were put in place during the pandemic cannot be transferred one-to-one to a supply shock and inflation scenario.""  This crisis, the politician from the liberal Free Democrats said, is ""different from that of the pandemic"" because it is not caused by a problem of demand, but of supply.Now itâ€™s up to the heads of stateOn October 7 the heads of state of the 27 EU member states are meeting for an informal summit in Prague. It is likely that the issue of capping gas prices will be discussed by the heads of state. European Commission President von der Leyen sent a letter to the EU leaders beforehand mapping out a â€œroadmapâ€ on how to tackle the energy crisis.This article is published Fridays.

Article misrepresents studies on Greenland climate,"An article shared on social media says studies of Greenland show climate change is caused by natural factors, not carbon emissions. This is misleading; scientists cited in the piece say it misrepresents their findings, and the effect of fossil fuels on global warming is well-documented.""In a major challenge to climate alarmism, climate scientists have shown that Greenland ice has recovered since 2012 and the earlier loss was due to 'natural variability' not human CO2 emissions,"" says an October 2, 2022 post from The Daily Sceptic Facebook page.The post links to an article on the website of The Daily Sceptic, which has previously published misinformation about climate change. It was also shared on platforms including Twitter and Reddit.Screenshot of a Facebook post from The Daily Sceptic taken October 5, 2022Citing a December 2021 study by Japanese climatologists at Hokkaido University, the article says they attributed slowing warming in Greenland to El NiÃ±o, a natural weather phenomenon.""Such findings play havoc with the simplistic 'settled' science notion that carbon dioxide produced by humans burning fossil fuel is the main, if not only, driver of global temperature warming or cooling,"" The Daily Sceptic piece says.However, the lead author of the study, Shinji Matsumura of Japan's National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience, said the findings do not support that claim.""Our paper is misrepresented on that blog. We do not agree that (the findings) 'play havoc with' the view that human-emitted CO2 is a main driver of global warming,"" he said in an email on October 5, 2022. ""Global average air temperature is rising due to anthropogenic climate change.""Study does not refute global warmingMatsumura, in an article to publicize the research in April 2022, said emissions are driving climate change in Greenland as elsewhere.""The Greenland ice sheet is melting in the long run due to global warming associated with greenhouse gas emissions, but the pace of that melting has slowed in the last decade,"" he said in the article published by Hokkaido University. ""That slowing was a mystery until our research showed it is connected to changes to the El NiÃ±o climate pattern in the Pacific.""The study attempted to explain an observed decline in temperatures and rates of ice-sheet melting in Greenland since 2012. The research showed El NiÃ±o triggered cooler temperatures in Greenland by driving cooler air north via cyclones.The findings ""demonstrate how natural changes can act alongside the long-term global warming trend to vary local conditions,"" the university's article says. In email, Matsumura added that the study does not ""undermine the seriousness of climate change or the need to tackle greenhouse gas emissions.""The article said: ""We expect that global warming and ice sheet melting in Greenland and the rest of the Arctic will accelerate even further in the future due to the effects of anthropogenic warming.""Holocene cooling eventThe Daily Sceptic article cited a number of other studies about periods of warming thousands of years ago.The website linked to an article that cited a 2007 study led by Takuro Kobashi, an associate professor in the Graduate School of Environmental Studies at Tohoku University.The authors of that study examined Greenland ice cores to shed light on an abrupt cooling of the climate 8,200 years ago. They found Greenland cooled by up to 3.3 degrees Celsius over 20 years.That cooling took place during the Holocene, a relatively warm period after the last ice age. The study's authors said the aim was ""to quantify possible impacts of future abrupt climate change"" from greenhouse gas emissions caused by humans.Icebergs and ice sheet in Baffin Bay, Greenland on July 19, 2022 ( AFP / Kerem YÃ¼cel)In the Daily Sceptic article, ""the writer misunderstood the climate of the Holocene,"" Kobashi told AFP in an email on October 5, 2022.He cited another more recent study he authored that examined various factors affecting the climate of Greenland during the period. The study says volcanic activity ""played a critical role.""Kobashi said: ""Greenland was warmer in the early Holocene because of the Earth's orbital change, but it may be that global average surface temperature is now the warmest.""Misleading sea ice claimThe Daily Sceptic article also cited information from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) regarding the extent of Arctic sea ice.The NSIDC said the minimum extent of Arctic sea ice for 2022, recorded in September, was higher than that recorded in 2012. The article cited this as evidence that ""the recovery of Arctic summer sea ice has been spectacular of late.""However, the article misrepresents the data.Although there was a wider spread of ice than in September 2012, the NSIDC said this year's reading was 1.54 million square kilometers (595,000 square miles) below the 1981-2010 average.Greenland is among the territories where glaciers are shrinking -- worldwide they lost 267 billion tonnes a year from 2000 to 2019 ( AFP / Laurence CHU, John SAEKIThe NSIDC said September sea ice had declined by 12.3 percent per decade compared to the 1981-2010 average since records began.""Since 1979, September has lost 3.59 million square kilometers (1.39 million square miles),"" the center said. ""This is equivalent to about twice the size of Alaska.""Carbon emissions' roleThe role of carbon emissions in climate change is well-documented.Greenhouse gases released from burning fossil fuels trap heat close to the Earth. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summed up the trend in a chart at the start of its major report in August 2021.The left-hand chart below shows temperatures rising sharply in the past 150 years. In the right-hand chart, the blue line at the bottom shows how much lower global temperatures would be without humans releasing greenhouse gases by burning fossil fuels.The blue line in the graph on the right shows how temperatures would not have risen without human-caused emissions ( IPCC)Alongside the Holocene claim, The Daily Sceptic said ""numerous other scientists have discovered equally dramatic temperature changes in the recent past.""But experts say records of historic warming periods do not mean emissions are not responsible for the sharp rise in temperatures over the last century and a half.The claim that recent warming is normal because temperatures have fluctuated before ""is just stupid logic,"" Mike Lockwood, professor of space environment physics at the University of Reading, previously told AFP.""It is of course true that temperatures have risen and fallen in the past but that is not a reason for assuming that the present change has the same causes as past ones,"" he said.The IPCC reviews studies to summarise the state of knowledge about how humans are driving climate change, using reports compiled by hundreds of scientists in dozens of countries.""It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,"" the IPCC said in the first part of its 2021 report.AFP has fact-checked other false and misleading claims about climate change here.Roland LLOYD PARRYAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesCLIMATEFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: EU states agree to train Ukrainian soldiers, MEPs discuss Schengen expansion, and Mediterranean countries call for a fair distribution of the migration load","The EU member states have reportedly agreed to establish training programs for Ukrainian forces. Furthermore, MEPs discuss expanding the Schengen zone, the EU supports Bosnia and Herzegovina in dealing with irregular migration, border security, and human trafficking. And a plan for a ""gas price corridor"" has been drafted by four EU countries.EP starts debate on Croatia joining the Schengen areaBrussels (HINA) – The process for adopting a European Parliament opinion on Croatian membership in the Schengen area began on Monday afternoon, when a draft report on the matter was presented at the Civil Liberties Committee. ""Croatia has proven that it is ready to apply all provisions from the Schengen acquis in a satisfactory manner,"" said the rapporteur of the European Parliament, Paulo Rangel, when presenting the draft report.Shortly after its presentation, the draft opinion by Rapporteur Rangel will be voted on by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, after which the European Parliament should vote on it at a plenary session. The European Parliament might adopt its opinion already this month, after which Croatia's application will need the unanimous support of the Council members that already apply the Schengen acquis, a decision that is expected to be made by the end of the year.  In October 2019, after four years of evaluation, the European Commission concluded that Croatia had taken the necessary measures to accede to Schengen. On 29 June 2022, the Council of the European Union initiated the procedure for adopting a decision on the admission of Croatia, requesting the opinion necessary for a final decision on accession from the European Parliament. The Council of the EU then proposed to abolish border controls on land and maritime Croatian borders with Schengen countries from 1 January 2023, with airports to follow suit from 26 March. (October 10)EU states agree to train thousands of Ukrainian soldiersBrussels (dpa) – The EU states want to train around 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the future. There is an agreement of the Political and Security Committee (PSC), German press agency dpa learned from EU circles. The PSC brings together the ambassadors of the EU states under the chair of the European External Action Service. The decision has yet to be formally confirmed by the EU countries.

(Photo: FENA/EU)Sarajevo (FENA) – Vice-President of the European Commission for the Promotion of European Lifestyle Margaritis Schinas visited Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he announced the implementation of a new project worth 39.5 million euros, which is aimed at supporting Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in dealing with migration flows and border management.â€œIn recent months, the number of people on the move has increased again, which means that we all need to address the situation with increased caution. That is why I decided to make a series of visits, which besides Sarajevo also includes Belgrade, Skopje and Tirana, to see how we can best respond to the situation,â€ Schinas said.Schinas met with the Minister of Security of BiH, Selmo CikotiÄ‡, and thanked him for the leading role that the Ministry has in improving the migrant situation, coordinating services, and enhancing international cooperation. In addition, Schinas called for stronger cooperation and coordination with the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (FRONTEX) as well as for BiH to finalize the establishment of a common contact point for cooperation with the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (EUROPOL).Since more people on the move began arriving in Bosnia and Herzegovina in early 2018, the European Union has provided more than 100 million euros for the care of refugees, asylum seekers, and migrants, as well as to help BiH strengthen its capacity to manage migration. The new project, worth 39.5 million euros, is aimed at improving border management and will provide a framework for the transition of coordination and management of the response to migration in BiH with UN agencies, humanitarian actors and BiH authorities. The funds originate from 101 million euros that the EU has allocated to three Western Balkan partners, BiH, North Macedonia, and Serbia, to strengthen capacity in managing migration flows.

The â€œvoluntaryâ€ solution did not improve the situation of the frontline countries.At a meeting held in the Cypriot province of Paphos, the interior ministers also reinforced their position that the main tool for managing migration is cooperation with countries of origin and transit.In this context, Spanish Minister Fernando Grande-Marlasca emphasized that Southern European countries are already working closely with non-EU countries to offer assistance so that their citizens do not leave their homes. â€œWe must engage with Africa in a holistic way, not only in terms of security, not only in the fight against smuggling, but more broadly, economically and socially,â€ he stressed.The interior ministers met for the fourth time in this format, and on this occasion, they focused on strengthening their common position ahead of the EU Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will be held next week in Luxembourg, with the aim of giving impetus to the negotiations of the European Pact on Migration and Asylum. (October 8)Italy proposes a dynamic price corridor for natural gasPrague (ANSA) – Italy, Poland, Greece and Belgium have worked on a proposal for dynamic pricing of natural gas, to be applied in a scenario where there is no supply shortage and there is an exchange of gas supply and demand. This is one of the key points of the 'non-paper'– an unofficial document – signed by the four EU countries, which ANSA has seen. Based on the concept of a â€œdynamic corridorâ€, it is possible to establish a central value for this corridor and review it regularly, taking into account external benchmarks (for example, oil prices) and allowing fluctuations (for example by 5%) around the central value within the corridor, the proposal reads.The 'non paper' containing the proposal has been circulated in the offices of the European institutions, has been sent to the Commission and will also be among the proposals subject to debate among the member countries. The document envisages that the application of this â€œdynamic corridorâ€ to the price of gas has a â€œcentral value"" that would represent a maximum price cap.

EU enlargement: Bosnia and Herzegovina takes the next step toward EU membership,"On Wednesday, the EU Commission recommended granting Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) the much-awaited EU candidate status. As recently as mid-June, when Ukraine and Moldova were given the prospect of EU membership, however, the EU had still been cautious regarding Bosnia. Geopolitically, the move comes at the right time, as it could not only prevent the Serb-dominated entity of Republika Srpska (RS) from seceding, but also put a stop to Moscow's ambitions in the region.In a report published in Brussels on October 12, the European Commission recommended that EU candidate status should be awarded to Bosnia and Herzegovina, subject to reforms and conditions. In his announcement statement, EU Enlargement Commissioner Oliver VÃ¡rhely urged leaders in Bosnia ""to make the most of this historic opportunity"" and advance reforms.The so-called Enlargement Package for 2022 includes the European Commission's annual reports for the Western Balkans and Turkey. Bosnia and Herzegovina received the status of a potential candidate in 2003 and its application for membership in the EU was officially submitted in 2016.The next step on the path to membership will now be the opening of formal accession talks, a step which again requires the approval of all EU member states and may take years. The commission's conditional backing for Bosnia follows a similar approval for Ukraine and Moldova in June. Austria and Slovenia, among others, had urged the bloc to also consider Bosnia during the deliberations.Bosnia and Herzegovina: interethnic tensions after recent electionsOn October 2, general elections were held in BiH, and although the political winners have different views on most strategic issues regarding the future of the country, one of the rare issues where there is a formal consensus is joining the EU. After the elections, the winners called for pro-European reforms. The EU Commissionâ€™s decision could give a new impetus to the authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which are to be formed after the recent elections.A woman walks past election posters of the candidates of the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Parliamentary elections were held in Bosnia on October 2. Photo: Armin Durgut/AP/dpaBiH officials reckon that the decision of the EU Commission to recommend to the Council of the European Union the granting of candidate status for EU membership to Bosnia and Herzegovina comes at the right moment and is historic for the country and its citizens. BiH Foreign Minister Bisera TurkoviÄ‡ welcomed the Commission's recommendation, saying on Facebook: ""This is a strong message (...) that we hoped (for) earlier.â€ She added that it was a recognition of all the efforts BiH has undertaken, despite obstacles, to align its policy with the EU, notably on the Ukraine war.The president of the Croat HDZ party in BiH, Dragan ÄŒoviÄ‡, said on Twitter this was â€œa historic day for BiHâ€. ÄŒoviÄ‡ submitted BiH's application for EU candidate status in 2016 in his then capacity as Chair of the BiH Presidency.Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡, one of the three members of the presidency, said it was important for the commission to note that Bosnia and Herzegovina had aligned 80 percent of its foreign policy statements with the EU. He added, however, that the granting of candidate status remained uncertain.Regarding the electoral reform, he criticized the recent decision of the High Representative of the International Community in BiH, Christian Schmidt, who had made use of his powers and imposed electoral law changes on election night on October 2. Ahead of the elections, negotiations between key political actors on electoral reform had failed, heightening political and interethnic tensions. The reform is mainly about the problem of proportional representation of Croats as the smallest of the three constituent peoples. KomÅ¡iÄ‡ has reported Schmidt to the Constitutional Court, claiming that the electoral law changes have deceived voters and further fueled ethnic divisions. ""The High Representative for BiH, in making decisions, is completely disregarding rulings of the European Court of Human Rights and the opinion of the European Commission, and thus jeopardizes BiH's EU path,"" he said. On Wednesday, EU Enlargement Commissioner VÃ¡rhely appealed to the leaders of BiH to â€œproceed quickly to reform the constitution and the electoral lawâ€.Needed reforms and conditionsAfter the elections, the EU Commission called for a rapid formation of government and authorities at all levels, so that they could tackle the fulfillment of the conditions. The required reforms to advance entry into the bloc relate to building the rule of law, adopting measures to prevent conflicts of interest, and strengthening the prevention of and fight against corruption and organized crime. In addition, Bosnia and Herzegovina must promote measures to ensure effective coordination at all levels of border management and immigration, as well as the functioning of the asylum system. The conditions also include ensuring the prohibition of torture, freedom of expression and the media, and the protection of journalists. However, due to internal political divisions, the question is to what degree BiH will be able to fulfill the set conditions.â€œTodayâ€™s choice is a political impulse. Certainly, Bosnia does not meet all conditions to be a country of the EU today. However, we believe that these conditions will become reality. It is an impulse, which I hope the new political authorities of Bosnia will understand and exploit. It is an incentive for actionâ€, said EU Foreign Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell.He also stressed that the recommendation comes at a time when â€œa battle of ideas is underway with Moscow. We cannot close our eyes to its growing influence, not only in the Balkansâ€.Slovenia: Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s accession is a â€œhigh-level geopolitical issueâ€The President of the Republic of Slovenia, Borut Pahor, has welcomed the European Commission's decision to recommend EU candidate status for BiH. He said it was a significant move for peace and stability in the Western Balkans. Pahor argued that BiH's accession should not be viewed from a narrow administrative point of view. More important than meeting conditions was the fact that this was a ""high-level geopolitical issue"", he was quoted as saying in a press release. Despite initial setbacks, Slovenia regards it as a success of their own initiative that the European Council ordered the Commission to draft a report on Bosnia and Herzegovina, the president's office said. ""Today's decision by the European Union raises hope that Bosnia and Herzegovina will be granted candidate status at the December EU Summit,"" the press release said. It continued to say that this was a turning point, because it marked the actual beginning of Bosnia's European future and the move was of great importance for peace and stability in the Western Balkans.Welcoming the news, Sloveniaâ€™s Prime Minister Robert Golob was quoted as saying by his office on Wednesday that ""Slovenia will endeavor to make sure the entire Western Balkan region joins the EU as soon as possibleâ€. Golob also noted that the Commission's decision was based on an initiative the Slovenian government put forward in June.""This recommendation confirms that our position was right; our arguments were understood and then accepted."" Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon is hopeful the EU Commission's decision will drive reform efforts. She said this was a strategic decision that sent the entire Western Balkans a clear signal that their future was in the EU, a message which was ""particularly important in the light of the altered security and political situation in Europe following Russia's aggression in Ukraineâ€.EU enlargement: What about North Macedonia?North Macedonia began entry negotiations together with its neighbor Albania after years of delays. The countries received EU candidate status in 2005 and 2014, respectively. The yearly enlargement report for North Macedonia notes that the country has made progress in most key areas, with the exception of freedom of expression, where the European Commission highlighted that progress was â€œlimitedâ€.On Wednesday, at the press conference, Enlargement Commissioner Varheyi said this was due to the lack of agreement between the government and the opposition on â€œoutstanding legislative reformsâ€. Greater efforts were also required regarding the public administration reform, the fight against corruption, and the rule of law, the commissioner told the European Parliamentâ€™s Foreign Affairs Committee, and urged the country to keep up the reform pace through the screening process, which started in July.The head of the EU delegation in Skopje handed over the report to Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski, who said that the document would be â€œanalyzed in detailâ€ to identify the areas where more work was needed. He expressed his governmentâ€™s commitment to keep fulfilling the necessary reforms and advance the harmonization of the legislation with the EUâ€™s.North Macedonia was also praised for its alignment with the EUâ€™s foreign policy, most notably on Ukraine and sanctions against Russia.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: EU recommends candidate status for BiH, ECJ sees no discrimination in headscarf ban, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer criticizes EU Commission over migration and EU wants to protect Ukrainian refugees until 2024","The EU Commission wants to grant BiH EU candidate status and the EU top court judges on a headscarf ban in the workplace. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer sharply criticizes the EU Commission over the handling of migration in the EU, while Commissioner Ylva Johansson has announced the extension of protection for Ukrainian refugees until 2024.
 
European Commission recommends granting BiH candidate statusBrussels (FENA) – European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi confirmed that the European Commission has recommended granting candidate status for becoming a member of the European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina.He presented the 2022 Enlargement Package adopted by the College in Brussels, setting out details from the report on the progress of the Western Balkan countries and Turkey on their path to European Union membership.VÃ¡rhelyi stressed that this recommendation for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) came under the condition that some steps were fulfilled, that the laws on the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council of Bosnia and Herzegovina (HJPC BiH), on courts and on preventing conflicts of interest were passed, and that decisive steps to fight corruption and organized crime were taken.It was also necessary to ensure better border management mechanisms, establish a functioning asylum system, prevent cases of torture and abuse through the establishment of an international mechanism, guarantee freedom of the media and the protection of journalists, and to enable adequate monitoring of media intimidation.The European Commission underlined that the European Council has called on BiH leaders to urgently address the outstanding judiciary and constitutional reforms.â€œGranting candidate country status is an offer from the European side to BiH and the people of BiH. We do this for the people of BiH, however, it comes with high expectations, the political elite must make it a reality,â€ VÃ¡rhelyi said.After the elections held on October 2, VÃ¡rhelyi says, legislatures and governments are expected to be formed quickly so that they can begin to deal with the implementation of the European reforms.â€œThe European Council is likely to take a final decision in December. The Commission is ready to give its support, but will continue to monitor the implementation of the 14 key priorities of the EU Commissionâ€™s opinion through which basic progress is measured and which are non-negotiable. BiH must fulfill them all before negotiations for membership can be opened,â€ concluded VÃ¡rhelyi.He reiterated that the countries of the Western Balkans are a priority for the EU and stated that the strategic commitment was for all six countries to join the EU as soon as possible. (October 12)EU Court of Justice: Banning headscarves at work is not discriminationBrussels (ANSA) – â€œThe internal rule of an undertaking prohibiting the visible wearing of religious, philosophical or spiritual signs does not constitute direct discrimination if it is applied to all workers in a general and undifferentiated way.â€ The European Court of Justice has ruled in the case of a Belgian woman of Muslim faith who had been denied an internship contract for expressing her refusal to remove her veil in order to comply with the companyâ€™s neutrality policy. In Thursdayâ€™s judgment, the judges in Luxembourg observed that â€œreligion and belief must be regarded as a single ground of discrimination, otherwise the general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation provided for by EU lawâ€ is undermined.The Court states that, under Union law, â€œa provision of an undertakingâ€™s terms of employment which prohibits workers from manifesting, through words, through clothing, or in any other way, their religious or philosophical beliefs, whatever those beliefs may be, does not constitute, with regard to workers who intend to exercise their freedom of religion and conscience through the visible wearing of a sign or an item of clothing with religious connotations, direct discrimination â€˜on the [ground] of religion or beliefâ€™ for the purposes of EU law, provided that that provision is applied in a general and undifferentiated way.â€In fact, it is explained that â€œsince every person may have a religion or religious, philosophical or spiritual belief, such a rule, provided that it is applied in a general and undifferentiated way, does not establish a difference in treatment based on a criterion that is inextricably linked to religion or to those beliefs.â€ (October 13)Nehammer sharply criticizes EU Commission over migrationVienna (APA) – Austrian Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Austrianâ€™s Peopleâ€™s Party/Ã–VP) laments a massive increase of migration in Austria. In this context, he sharply criticizes the EU Commission. â€œI expect the EU Commission to get its act together because more and more member countries are dissatisfied,â€ Nehammer said in an interview with the German newspaper â€œWeltâ€ (Tuesday edition).â€œWhy doesnâ€™t the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, finally take action as EU law is constantly being broken, when so many irregular migrants arrive in a landlocked country like Austria, who have previously moved through several EU countries and safe third countries without being stopped?â€ Nehammer asked. The EU Commission had â€œunfortunately ignored the porous external borders in recent years.â€â€œThe EU border protection agency Frontex must also be held accountable in order to finally effectively protect the EUâ€™s external border and to be a protective wall for the member states and against the crime of human trafficking,â€ Chancellor Nehammer said.In addition, the EU Commission must ensure that home countries take back illegal migrants as quickly as possible, and give these states appropriate incentives.According to the Austrian Chancellor, Austria received almost 57,000 asylum applications between the beginning of January and the end of August â€” an increase of 195 percent compared to the previous year. â€œAnd the figures will continue to rise. In addition, there are around 85,000 Ukrainians to whom we provide protection and whom we care for. Thatâ€™s enough of that for Austria,â€ says Nehammer.EU Commission Vice President Margaritis Schinas, responsible for migration, following a meeting with Austrian Minister of the Interior Gerhard Karner (Ã–VP) in Vienna on Monday, stressed on Twitter: â€œNo state can manage migration alone.â€ They would have to work together as â€œTeam Europeâ€. According to Schinas, he had informed Karner about his recent trip to the Balkans after rising numbers of arrivals put pressure on Austria. He also met Nehammer on Monday evening.A spokeswoman for the EU Commission in Brussels said on Tuesday that they were aware of the challenges. Austria had recorded a significant increase, particularly from India and Tunisia and across the Balkan route. The issue would also be discussed at the EUâ€™s Council of Interior Ministers on Friday. The spokeswoman also announced ministerial consultations between Austria, Slovakia, Slovenia, the Czech Republic and Hungary. (October 11)European Commission wants to protect Ukrainian refugees until 2024Brussels (Belga) – The special protection status for Ukrainian refugees will have to be extended by at least one year until March 2024, European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said when presenting an online tool that refugees can use to find a job.â€œThe directive on temporary protection will remain in force at least until March 2024,â€ Johansson announced. The directive was activated in early March this year to almost automatically grant a right of residence to Ukrainians who fled from the Russian invasion.Thanks to this protection statute, refugees do not have to go through the traditional asylum procedure and receive immediate support in finding housing and access to education, health care and the labor market. Currently, 4.2 million refugees enjoy this status.The guideline is provisionally valid for one year, until March 2023, and can be extended for a maximum of two years. According to Johansson, it is already clear that the application should be extended by one year. The new bombings of Kiev and other cities in Ukraine showed â€œhow important it is that we continue to provide shelter for those who have to flee,â€ the Swedish European Commissioner said.

Video falsely claims vaccinated individuals are no longer human,"A video claims people vaccinated against Covid-19 are ""genetically modified"" and have been re-classified as ""homoborgenesis,"" citing a supposed NASA study as evidence. This is false; the US agency told AFP it has done no research on the subject, and leading health authorities have repeatedly debunked claims that the shots alter human DNA.In the clip shared on Instagram on October 9, 2022, social media influencer Maria Zee interviews lawyer Todd Callender. Both have previously spread Covid-19 misinformation.Callender says in the video that the Covid-19 vaccine alters a person's DNA, claiming these ""genetically modified people are now referred to as homoborgenesis, not homo sapiens."" As evidence, he cites a purported research paper on fifth-generation warfare from NASA's Langley Research Center, which studies air, space and earth science.Screenshot of an Instagram post taken October 11, 2022The clip was shared across social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. Similar claims appeared on websites such as BitChute and Reddit.""Is it true that people who were given mRNA gene therapy shots are in fact now the property -- the chattel property -- of the patent holders?"" Callender asks in the clip, questioning whether vaccinated individuals have human rights.Callender also made the claim about ""homoborgenesis"" on Jane Ruby's September 28, 2022 show. Ruby, a self-described ""health economist and New Right political pundit,"" has repeatedly shared Covid-19 misinformation.The claim echoes a debunked theory that people vaccinated against Covid-19 are no longer legally human and are therefore patentable. In 2013, the US Supreme Court unanimously ruled that isolated segments of human DNA could not be patented.It is unclear where the term ""homoborgenesis"" originated, but AFP found no references to it on NASA's website.""There is absolutely zero basis in fact that NASA Langley is researching this or has put out any research papers pertaining to this,"" said April Phillips, news chief at the NASA Langley Research Center.Covid-19 vaccines do not alter DNAAFP has repeatedly debunked posts that say Covid-19 vaccines alter human DNA -- a claim that medical experts have also dismissed.Messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines, the type of Covid-19 shot developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, deliver genetic instructions to cells on how to build coronavirus proteins. This is different from other vaccines, which inject small amounts of dead or weakened viruses to train the body to recognize and attack certain proteins, called antigens.https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGjppkdEYHc""The genetic material delivered by mRNA vaccines never enters the nucleus of your cells, which is where your DNA is kept,"" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says on its website. ""Viral vector Covid-19 vaccines deliver genetic material to the cell nucleus to allow our cells to build protection against Covid-19. However, the vector virus does not have the machinery needed to integrate its genetic material into our DNA, so it cannot alter our DNA.""Similarly, the World Health Organization (WHO) debunked the claim in a May 2022 statement: ""The mRNA in the vaccine has not been shown to incorporate itself into the genes of vaccine recipients and breaks down in the weeks after vaccination.""AFP has fact-checked other false and misleading claims about vaccines here.Natalie WadeAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesCOVID-19 VACCINESFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: EU's Borrell wants to determine responsibility for war crimes in Ukraine, while the EU continues to show support for the country. The EU's Public Prosecutor's Office screens vaccine purchases, and Serbia pledges to align visa policy","The EUâ€™s foreign ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss further support for Ukraine, in particular in the form of training Ukrainian soldiers. EU High Representative Borrell said he would support determining responsibility for Ukrainian war crimes. Due to public interest, the EUâ€™s Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office is investigating vaccine purchases in which text messages played a role, and Serbia promised to align its visa policy to the EUâ€™s. Borrell to determine responsibility for war crimes in UkraineBrussels/Luxembourg (HINA) – EU High Representative for Foreign and Security Policy Josep Borrell said on Monday that he supports determining responsibility for Russian war crimes in Ukraine.â€œI am very much in favor of taking all measures of responsibility for crimes, but let's see what is the best way,â€ Borrell replied to a reporterâ€™s question whether he supports the establishment of a special court to deal with Russian war crimes in Ukraine.On Monday, the EUâ€™s foreign ministers gathered in Luxembourg for a meeting to approve a mission to train 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers on EU territory and grant an additional 500 million euros in aid for arms procurement for Ukrainian forces.The mission to train Ukrainian soldiers is due to begin by the middle of next month in Poland and Germany.The ministers will also discuss the delivery of Iranian drones to Russia. The Ukrainian capital Kiev was exposed to powerful drone attacks on Monday morning. Borrell said they needed to determine whose drones were used, adding that Iran denies it was theirs. Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod said without any reservations that these were Iranian drones and that the EU should respond to this with â€œconcrete measures.â€Unrelated to the drone issue, ministers are set to impose sanctions against 15 Iranian officials, which include travel bans and asset freezes, for the repression of protesters demonstrating after Iranâ€™s moral police jailed and killed 22-year-old Mahsu Amini for not wearing a hijab in the prescribed manner. (October 17)EU military support for Ukraine on the riseBrussels (AFP) – â€œThis is a big first for the EU,â€ commented a European official. â€œWe have never carried out a mission on this scale,â€ he stressed. The foreign ministers of the 27 member countries were set to endorse two decisions on Monday at a meeting in Luxembourg, and the mission would be immediately operational, diplomatic sources said.Indeed, several training courses are already under way in various member states, particularly in Germany and France, where Ukrainian soldiers are being trained to use cannons, missile launchers and air defense systems provided by Europeans.France will train â€œup to 2,000 Ukrainian soldiersâ€ on its soil, French Minister of the Armed Forces SÃ©bastien Lecornu announced in a daily newspaper on Saturday.These training courses will benefit from funding allocated by the European Peace Facility (EPF), a fund set up outside the European budget to provide military assistance to Ukraine.  (October 17)European Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office investigates EU vaccine purchasesLuxembourg (dpa) – The EUâ€™s multi-billion-dollar coronavirus vaccine purchases have been targeted by the European Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office. â€œThe European Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office (EPPO) confirms that it is investigating the purchase of Covid-19 vaccines in the European Union,â€ the authority announced on Friday. This confirmation was given â€œdue to extremely high public interest.â€ No further details would be revealed at this stage.During the pandemic, the EU Commission negotiated and concluded contracts for hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine on behalf of the member states. The procedure was repeatedly criticized because the contracts were only partially made public and because there were delays in the delivery of the vaccines.What exactly the Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office is now investigating remained unclear. In particular, a deal for up to 1.8 billion doses from BioNTech/Pfizer with an estimated contract volume of 35 billion euros from the spring of 2021 has been criticized for months. As the â€œNew York Timesâ€ reported, personal contact between EU Commission President von der Leyen and Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla was decisive for the conclusion. They are also said to have exchanged text messages. The EU Commission denied journalists access to the text messages in question. According to a September report, the authority also failed to provide the European Court of Auditors with any information requested about the transaction. (October 14)Johansson: Serbia has pledged to align visa policy with European UnionLuxembourg (Tanjug) – The Western Balkans and its migrant route was a key point of debate at a ministerial meeting of the blocâ€™s interior ministers in Luxembourg. Czech Minister Vit RakuÅ¡en and Commissioner for Internal Policy Ylva Johansson said Serbia must adapt its visa policy to the EUâ€™s as soon as possible. The number of migrants entering the EU across the Balkans is beginning to seriously concern the EU member states. According to Johansson, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen has already been in contact with President VuÄiÄ‡.â€œWe have got promises that Serbia will align their visa policy with ours starting with some of the nationalities that is really urgent now, like the Tunisians, the Burundis and the Indians,â€ Johansson said.She added that she expects all other Balkan governments to align their policy to the EUâ€™s. According to her, the situation with migrants in the Union is becoming critical and some member countries find it difficult to manage the situation. She said she does not rule out introducing other measures if Belgrade does not take the steps required of it. But she believes that talks and cooperation should be the first step, â€œbecause they had promised that they will alignâ€ visa policy said the Commissioner and announced three meetings with Balkan politicians later this month in Berlin, Prague and Tirana.The Commissioner has denied media claims that Russia and its propaganda are behind these waves of migrants and says she has not seen such a thing. RakuÅ¡an also announced that he would travel to Serbia together with Commissioner Johansson. It is also important for him to intensify work with Serbia and other Balkan countries, he said. He explained that more and more migrants are heading to the EU across the Balkan route. The â€œresult [of our talks today is that] we really have to have very deep discussions with Western Balkan countries. We have to speak about harmonization of visa policies between the Western Balkan countries and EU countries. The debate was also about a necessary visit.â€ RakuÅ¡an said.

"Europe in brief: Ukrainian people win Sakharov Prize, former Italian president Silvio Berlusconi defends Putin, and MEPs give a clear vote against Frontex","This week in Europe: The EU parliament awarded the Ukrainian people its human rights prize, former Italian president Silvio Berlusconi caused some reactions over his remarks on Putin, and the European Parliament refused to discharge Europeâ€™s border agency Frontex.Sakharov Prize of the EU Parliament goes to the Ukrainian people this yearStrasbourg (dpa) – â€œThis prize is for the Ukrainians who are fighting on the ground. For those who were forced to flee. For those who have lost loved ones and friends. For everyone who stands up and fights for what they believe in,â€ said EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola. The prize was intended to recognize the efforts of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, elected representatives and civil society, she said.Since 1988, the Sakharov Prize has been awarded by the European Parliament to personalities or organizations working to defend human rights and freedom of expression. Last year, it went to imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and the Colombian Truth Commission were also nominated this year. The award is due to be presented in Strasbourg in December. (October 19)Clash in Strasbourg over Berlusconiâ€™s words about PutinBrussels (ANSA) – In a matter of hours, Silvio Berlusconiâ€™s words about Vladimir Putin have become an international affair. They arrived in the European Parliament just as the Socialists & Democrats (S&D group) were preparing a sortie against the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP) and the Renew group, accusing them of whitewashing the extreme right in Europe. The EPP, a group of which Forza Italia (FI) is part, are in the crosshairs. Their support for Forza Italia is seen as support for a right-wing government that – this is the accusation of a part of the plenary in Strasbourg – risks weakening European positions.â€œFI has gone from a pillar of centrism to a crutch of post-fascism. Angela Merkel would never have accepted an alliance with the extreme right,â€ attacked S&D group leader Iratxe Garzia Perez. â€œThe EPP condemns Berlusconiâ€™s words or it will become an accomplice,â€ Renewâ€™s liberals urged. Manfred Weber, group leader and president of the EPP, did not go into the matter, but reiterated that â€œPutin is a war criminal and support for Kiev unites us.â€The reality is that Berlusconiâ€™s words created strong tensions within the group, where they were already regarding the real weight of FI in the government with extreme caution. A part of the EPP makes no secret of wishing for a timely retirement of the â€œCavaliereâ€ Berlusconi. Trying to distinguish the positions of Forza Italia from those of the former premier, group vice-president Paulo Rangel said, â€œBerlusconiâ€™s words are sad, but we have faith in Tajani and Forza Italia.â€In the afternoon, the debate in StraÃŸbourg turned to the 'rehabilitation of the far right in the EU'. ""The Italians are able to choose the government for themselves, get over it,"" said the Identity and Democracy Group president Marco Zanni, European parliament member of the Northern League. ""I have heard nonsense about Italy, our line on Ukraine will not change"", assured the head of the national delegation Fulvio Martusciello (FI). (October 19)European Parliament gives thumbs down to Frontex budgetStrasbourg (Belga) – The European Parliament expressed its disapproval in Strasbourg on Tuesday about how the European border security agency Frontex managed its budget in 2020. Thus, the plenary wants to vent its dissatisfaction with the functioning of the agency.By 345 votes to 284 (8 abstentions), the MEPs refused to grant Frontex the so-called discharge for the 2020 financial accounts, denouncing â€œthe extent of serious misconductâ€ by former director Fabrice Leggeri and the failure of the agency in its mission to protect the fundamental rights of migrants and asylum seekers.Frontex has been in the eye of the storm since journalists and NGOs denounced that agency employees were involved in hundreds of pushbacks of migrants from Greece to Turkey in 2020 and 2021. Leggeri resigned in April, following the publication of a report by European anti-fraud agency Olaf showing that executives had tried to cover up the pushbacks.Founded in 2004, Frontex has grown into the European agency with the highest budget over the past decade, driven by successive migration crises. Currently, more than 2,300 Frontex border guards are already supporting national authorities at the EUâ€™s external borders, and by 2027, the agency is intended to have a permanent corps of 10,000 troops. The budget is also increasing, from 118 million euros in 2011 to 364 million euros in 2020 to 754 million euros in 2022. Parliamentâ€™s refusal to grant discharge has no direct impact on these financial resources. (October 18)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Why is the renewal of the judiciary in Spain blocked?,"The renewal of the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary has been blocked for four years now. As Spain will hold the EU Council presidency in the second half of 2023, Brussels is urging the country to end the deadlock in the appointment of new incumbents to important judicial positions.Almost two weeks after the resignation of the chairman, there is still no agreement on the renewal of the Spanish General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ). Carlos Lesmes resigned earlier in October in protest against the political deadlock that has paralyzed appointments to fill this judicial body for four years. Lesmes took his decision out â€œof respectâ€ for the dignity of Spainâ€™s legal institutions and judges. These would â€œrightly expectâ€ that the responsible politicians would not remain â€œindifferentâ€ in a situation that seriously compromises the functioning of the entire judiciary.The 20-member General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), which is responsible for appointing judges and ensuring the judiciary's independence, has broken several records due to the impossibility of reaching a political agreement on its renewal: In December, its members will have been in office for nine years, the last four on a provisional basis. The council already has two vacancies (one due to retirement and the other due to death), and there are dozens of pending appointments in other judicial bodies. The council's mandate expired in December 2018, and it has since been operating on an interim basis because the ruling Socialists and the conservative opposition Popular Party (PP) can't agree on its makeup.The deadlock has caused increasing problems for the Spanish court system.Brussels has sounded a wake-up call: It is calling for an urgent renewal of the council and a legal change in the way its members are elected. The European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, pointed to the rotating presidency of the EU, which will be held by Spain in the second half of 2023, as a further incentive to resolve the problem. The left-wing government and the main conservative opposition party resumed negotiations a few days ago with the utmost secrecy – and an apparent willingness on both sides to reach an agreement.This unprecedented situation has stood out as a negative note in the reports on the rule of law that the European Commission has recently compiled on Spain, and has even led to a visit to the country by Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders, who tried to unblock the situation. He left Madrid at the end of September, confident that there was a â€œreal commitmentâ€ to renew the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) and then reform it, as requested by Brussels. The Belgian liberal politician had met with all interested parties: government, opposition and magistrates.Shortly after Commissioner Reynders' visit, and in view of the continuing lack of progress, Carlos Lesmes made good on his threat to resign as president of the CGPJ on October 9, in order to force the renewal of this body. This led to an unprecedented institutional crisis in the Spanish judiciary, with a council unable to function and fractured between progressives and conservatives fighting an open battle for its presidency. In addition, the Constitutional Court is without renewal, as the deadlock in the CGPJ has also prevented the filling of its vacancies. The same is happening in the Supreme Court, the one that dictates jurisprudence.The earthquake of Lesmes' resignation at least served to bring the head of government, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, and Alberto FeijÃ³o, the leader of the main opposition party, the conservative PP, together on the following day, October 10. They wanted to give themselves what they described as a â€œlast chanceâ€ to unblock the judicial governing body.Although the pact has not yet come to fruition, both sides are sending out messages that there is a good chance that it will be possible and that it will not take too long.What does the European Commission say about the rule of law in Spain?The European Commission is calling on Spain to urgently end the deadlock in the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), the governing body of Spanish judges. In its latest report on the rule of law in the EU, published last July, the EU executive calls on Spain to proceed with the renewal of the CGPJ â€œas a matter of priorityâ€ and to initiate, â€œimmediately afterwardsâ€, a process with a view to changing the method of electing its members, â€œtaking into account European standardsâ€; in other words, establishing that at least half of the councilâ€™s members should be â€œjudges elected by their peers.â€ In Spain, the 20 members of the body are elected by parliament, although the 12 members of judicial extraction come from a list of names previously provided by judges' associations.The report came at a critical moment in the negotiations between the PSOE and the PP, after the failure of the umpteenth attempt by both parties to agree on the renewal of the judiciary, this time with Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o at the head of the main opposition party. The resistance of the Popular Party to sit down and reach an agreement caused the CGPJ's mandate to expire such a long time, something unprecedented.â€œThe delay in renewing the CGPJ remains a cause for concern,â€ says the 30-page EU report on Spain. â€œThe Council of the Judiciary has been exercising its functions on an interim basis since December 2018.â€ This gave rise to fears that it could be perceived as â€œprone to politicization.â€ According to the document, â€œthere have been repeated calls for its urgent renewal and the situation has been described by key stakeholders as unsustainable and anomalous.â€However, the Commission acknowledged in its July report that there had been some progress in the preceding months in Spain. â€œI want to be fair, I have seen progress,â€ said VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, European Commissioner for Values and Transparency, one of the authors of the report. JourovÃ¡, who also serves as vice-president of the European Commission, regarded it as a step forward that the government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez withdrew the bill that sought to reduce the majority needed to elect members of the CGPJ last year. The adoption of this bill would have meant that the votes of the PP would no longer have been essential. If this law had been approved, JourovÃ¡ said, Spain â€œwould not have complied with the rules on the impartial creation of a general judicial council.â€ Its withdrawal â€œwas a positive thing.â€JourovÃ¡ warned that the persistence of immobility â€œis going to be a very serious problem for the Spanish judiciary, because it is blocking operations and appointments of judgesâ€, the effects of which were starting to become apparent â€œin the practical workings of judicial bodies.â€ JourovÃ¡ visited Spain shortly before the publication of the report and met with party members. She returned to Brussels with the impression that there would be no short-term solution.What is the General Council of the Judiciary and what are its functions?The CGPJ is a constitutional, collegiate, autonomous body, made up of judges and other renowned judicial experts, which exercises the functions of a government of the judiciary with the aim of guaranteeing the independence of judges, who acquire their posts through competitive examinations.It is the council that chooses certain judges, who are appointed at its discretion. This is its main function. The CGPJ appoints all the judges of the Supreme Court, which establishes jurisprudence; two judges of the Constitutional Court; and the presidents of the High Courts of Justice, the Provincial Courts and other governmental chambers. As the CGPJ was not renewed when it was due, in November 2018, many of these judges are in office on an interim basis.How are the members of the Council of the Judiciary elected?The members of the CGPJ should be appointed every five years, as established in the constitution. In some countries, it is the judges themselves who choose their top officials, in others, as is the case in Spain, they are chosen by parliament.The law establishes that the council is made up of twenty members – twelve judges and eight jurists – and all are elected by a three-fifths majority of parliament, ten by congress and ten by the senate, which requires the agreement of the PSOE and the PP.Why has the CGPJ still not been renewed?In practice, both the list of magistrates and the list of jurists are previously agreed by the political groups according to their parliamentary representation. Hence, the lack of understanding between PSOE and PP, the two majority parties, has prevented the CGPJ from being renewed since 2018, when its five-year mandate was due to expire.Therefore, the current CGPJ is a reflection of the parliamentary majorities that existed in Spain nine years ago, the ones that came out of the ballot box in the first term of office of former conservative Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy. At that time, nine of the members of the CGPJ were proposed by the PP and six by the PSOE. Izquierda Unida, the Catalan CiU and the Basque PNV proposed one name each.The current composition of parliament, from which the left-wing coalition that forms Pedro SÃ¡nchez's present government emerged, is very different, but the negotiations between the PP and the PSOE to transfer these majority ratios to the CGPJ have failed so far, mainly due to the refusal of the conservatives.For its part, SÃ¡nchez's government rejects the idea that the members of the council should be elected directly by the magistrates without the intervention of parliament, as requested by the PP, because if they elected themselves, they would be the only state power in whose election and control no other power would be involved.Serious effects of blockade and pending decisionsThis blockage, as warned at the opening ceremony of this Judicial Year, is the reason why in the coming months there will be twenty vacancies on the Supreme Court – 25% of its staff – and 49 of the 116 presidencies of courts in Spain are not held by an incumbent.A year ago, a technical report of this court pointed out that it was exercising its functions with 14% fewer judges than required by law, and that this could result in the court issuing a thousand fewer decisions a year, to the detriment of justice.The filling of the pending vacancies could shift existing majorities, especially among the magistrates of the Criminal Chamber, who are the ones who judge people that fall under a special jurisdiction (Spanish: aforado). They are the only judges who can open a criminal investigation against a member of parliament, a minister or a senator. They also have the last word on the most important criminal sentences, such as major corruption cases or those of the Catalan pro-independence leaders.The existing conservative majority in the Supreme Court will change when the pending renewal is completed. A group of conservative members of the current CGPJ is insistently blocking this. This was the ultimate reason for Lesmes' resignation, given that it is a breach of the law by the judges' governing body.Among the pending decisions of the Supreme Court is the one regarding the former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Common charger for electronic devices from 2024, barely any progress on gender equality, new Italian Prime Minister Meloni â€œready to collaborate with the EUâ€ and EU Commission President von der Leyen to travel to the Balkans","The EU Council has given its final approval to a common charger from 2024 onwards. Europe is making poor progress on gender equality. Ursula von der Leyen will travel to the Balkans to show solidarity with the region and Giorgia Meloni, new Italian Prime Minister, was welcomed by her European colleagues.  Finally a common charger in the EUBRUSSELS (HINA) – On Monday, the EU Council gave its final approval for the mandatory introduction of a single charger for cellphones and other electronic devices from 2024.â€œIt will no longer be necessary to buy a charger every time you buy a new mobile phone or similar device. A charger that is compatible with multiple devices will save money and time and contribute to reducing electronic waste,â€ said Jozef SÃ­kela, Czech Minister of Industry and Trade, whose country currently holds the EU Council presidency.The Common Charger Directive introduces USB-C as the standard charging slot for electronic devices in the European Union. From 2024, all devices such as mobile phones, tablets, e-readers, digital cameras, video game consoles and headsets will need to have a USB-C slot, which means that everyone will be able to charge their devices with the same charger.In order for consumers to know exactly what they are buying, the directive introduces a pictogram indicating whether a charger is offered with the new device and a label indicating the efficiency of charging.The directive should be published in the Official Journal of the European Union these days and enter into force 20 days after that publication. The new rules will begin to apply 24 months after their entry into force.In addition, 40 months after the entry into force of the directive, these new rules will apply to all laptops, which can then also be charged with a common charger. (October 24)Europe is barely making progress on gender equalityBrussels (Belga) – European gender equality progresses at a snailâ€™s pace, according to the recently published 2022 Gender Equality Index. Despite policy measures, the index has increased by only 0.6 percent since last year. Belgium does score above average.Currently, the average score is 68.6 out of 100, only 5.5 points higher than in 2010. Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands perform best, although progress on gender equality has stagnated in Sweden and Denmark. In Greece, Hungary and Romania, progress is the most difficult. Together with Lithuania, Croatia and the Netherlands, Belgium records one of the largest increases.The index is mainly based on data from 2020, the first pandemic year. In response, European Commissioner for Equality Helena Dalli emphasized that women should not lose significance in times of uncertainty and unrest.â€œWe need to continue our efforts for gender equality. In the wake of the pandemic, the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic crisis, both regional institutions and EU countries must consider gender equality in their fiscal and policy measures,â€ Helena Dalli.â€œThe most worrying thing is that this yearâ€™s score has declined in several areas for the first time since 2010,â€ said Carlien Scheele, director of the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE). Overall, the employment rate score declined. Furthermore, fewer women than men participated in formal and informal education activities in 2020, and while Covid-19 caused unprecedented pressure on the health sector, gender equality in health status and access to health care declined. Young women and women with a migrant background were hardest hit by unemployment. (October 24)Von der Leyen starts Balkan tour on Wednesday in SkopjeBrussels (MIA) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will visit the Western Balkans from Wednesday. Von der Leyenâ€™s main message is the EUâ€™s commitment to the European integration of the region.Of course, this visit takes place in the special context of successive crises, first Covid-19 and now the war in Ukraine and its aftermath, EU spokesperson Eric Mamer said.The aid is expected to come in the form of the involvement of the Western Balkan countries in the EU energy platform. The message is that the EU shows solidarity with the Western Balkans region, engages through programs that aim to encourage investment and shows the will to continue to cooperate, the spokesperson said. (October 24)Meloni swears, â€œimmediately at work to serve Italy, ready to collaborate with the EUâ€Rome (ANSA) – The leader of the far-right Fratelli dâ€™Italia (FdI) Giorgia Melonihas sworn her oath of office to the President of the Republic Sergio Mattarella, becoming the first woman to be Prime Minister of Italy. Meloni took over the leadership of the government from Mario Draghi, after her party won last monthâ€™s elections with 26% of the vote. â€œHere is the government team that, with pride and a sense of responsibility, will serve Italy. Now straight to work,â€ tweeted Prime Minister Meloni, just after leaving the presidential palace Quirinale, where her government was sworn in.The first international contacts followed soon, with phone calls to Ursula von der Leyen and the top of the European institutions, whom Meloni assured that the new center-right government is â€œready to collaborate.â€ The outcome of the European Council, the energy crisis, the war in Ukraine, the implementation of the national resilience plan and cohesion policies as well as an upcoming trip to Brussels – these were the topics at the center of todayâ€™s telephone conversations between Meloni and the heads of the EU institutions.â€œWe absolutely need to work for a rapid intervention to reduce energy prices for families and businesses,â€ Meloni said. The energy dossier is on top of the list of concerns of the new government. On social media, Meloni thanked all the foreign leaders who congratulated her to the new position, including Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n and his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki. She reiterated to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Italy will â€œalwaysâ€ be on the side of Ukraine, and told US President Joe Biden that she canâ€™t wait to strengthen the â€œfriendship and transatlantic partnership, based on common values.â€In the evening, the premier met French president Emmanuel Macron. During their meeting, albeit an informal one, all of the main European dossiers were discussed: the need to give quick and joint answers to high energy costs, support for Ukraine, the difficult economic situation and the management of migratory flows.

"Europe in brief: Germany and France want to continue their constructive relationship. In Austria, the number of people wanting to leave the EU is on the rise again and Slovenia warns against undermining the EU leadersâ€™ agreement on gas prices.","The meeting of French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was described as â€œconstructive.â€ According to a survey, the number of people wanting to leave the EU is on the rise in Austria. What else was important this week: Slovenia warns against undermining the base of the EU leaders' agreement on gas prices reached last week-Scholz and Macron: friendly and constructive dialogParis (AFP) – The meeting on October 26 in Paris between French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was described as â€œa friendly and constructive dialogâ€ by both sides, even though it came at a time when the relationship between the two countries was increasingly plagued by disagreements.The meeting lasted three hours and ended with a tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte between Emmanuel Macron and Olaf. Scholz, enabling them to discuss ""the perspectives towards which Europe wants to and must move.â€ In the coming weeks, the exchange should lead to ""a very good and intensive cooperation,"" said a German diplomatic source. For its part, the French Presidency also welcomed a ""very constructive"" exchange, during which the two leaders ""discussed Franco-German relations in a spirit of very close cooperation in the medium and long term.""During the meeting, the two leaders agreed that the European Union is facing ""one of the greatest crises in its history."" According to German diplomatic sources, this led them to discuss – among other things – the issues of security and defense, energy, with a view to high energy prices and supply issues, and innovation. These three topics presently create tensions between the two capitals. (October 26)Number of people wanting to leave the EU is on the rise again in AustriaVienna (APA) – War, inflation and declining confidence in politics are leaving their mark on attitudes towards the EU in Austria. On October 26, Paul Schmidt, Secretary General of the Austrian Society for European Policy (Ã–GfE), warned against the backdrop of a new survey on EU opinion trends, ""while a clear majority continues to back Austria's EU membership, the number of those considering to leave the Union is on the rise.""According to the nationwide opinion poll conducted at the end of September on behalf of Ã–GfE, almost two-thirds of respondents (64 percent) were in favor of Austria remaining a member of the European Union. 27 percent advocated leaving the Union. 9 percent answered ""don't know"" or made no statement. The number of people in Austria who want to leave the EU is thus as high as it last was more than six years ago.""Since the beginning of the Corona crisis, the number of those who would like to leave the EU has been increasing,"" Schmidt analyzed. ""Just before the outbreak of the pandemic in December 2019, the figure was a historically low 8 percent, but since then it has gradually risen by 19 percent. Over the same period, the number of those in favor of the EU has dropped by 11 from 75 to 64 percent, and the number of those who are unsure about the issue has declined by 8 percent.""Since the beginning of Austria's EU membership in 1995, the Austrian Society for European Policy has conducted a total of 66 nationwide surveys on this topic. They show that supporters of EU membership have always been in the majority. On average, according to Ã–GfE, their number amounted to around 70 percent, while the number of those in favor of leaving the EU was just under 22 percent. (October 25)Slovenia warns against undermining the agreement reached by EU leaders on limiting gas pricesLuxembourg (STA) – At a meeting of EU energy ministers on October 25 in Luxembourg, Slovenian Infrastructure Minister Bojan Kumer warned against undermining the agreement regarding measures to limit gas prices reached by EU leaders at the end of last week. According to him, Slovenia is in favor of limiting prices for long-term products as well.â€œIt is key that the entire winter is taken into account, meaning the entire heating season,"" he said, adding that Slovenia was also pushing for extending the measure to the whole of next year. That way the EU would ensure stable annual prices. He continued that the inclusion of long-term products would also prevent speculators from switching from short-term to long-term.In addition, according to Kumer, Slovenia advocates that the prices should not only be set at the end of the month for the following one, but should also cover a larger time period of past final prices. The price corridors should also be different for different products. The last time to agree on this package of measures, according to the minister, is 24 November, the date of the next Energy Ministers' meeting. ""However, I would not want to sacrifice quality in order to reach an agreement a week or so earlier,"" concluded Minister Kumer.

EU mulls energy measures," While energy prices on the markets are falling, the EU member states and the EU Commission continue putting their heads together over the question of how to tackle the energy crisis. For months, negotiations were revolving around a gas price cap. Last weekâ€™s result of the European Council on this question is still vague.Prices on the energy market are as low as they havenâ€™t been in months. European politicians might see this as a result of last weekâ€™s EU summit. â€œThe decisions taken last night led to a drop in the price of gas,â€ former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said on October 21. â€œAfter the agreement, the price dropped by 10%, showing that speculation is a significant factor,â€ Draghi added. EU Council President Charles Michel also stated that the summit deal had already led to prices falling. In any case, the EU leaders' lengthy negotiations led to results on how to tackle the energy crisis. Among the proposals were a price cap, joint gas purchases and a new price index for liquefied gas. What does this mean?Price cap lightFor months, negotiations between the member states about how such a price cap could look have been going on. Several countries, including Italy, Belgium, Greece and Poland, have been pushing for a price cap â€œto all wholesale natural gas transactions.â€ Germany and the Netherlands have been arguing that such a price cap could jeopardize the security of supply or lead to increased gas consumption. The EU leaders' result is to work on a gas price cap to limit extreme price peaks. Their joint declaration said a ""temporary dynamic price corridor on natural gas transactions"" should not jeopardize the security of supply. This is regarded as the lowest common denominator all countries could agree to. A number of heads of state and government claimed the results of the summit were a success.The proposed mechanism is not intended to depress the current price level, but is only intended to be used when manipulations such as the Russian delivery freeze via Nord Stream 1, for example, drive up prices. In fact, the summit compromise remained vague. A â€œroadmapâ€ for the coming weeks and months was agreed upon.Joint gas purchasesThe EU member states also agreed to buy gas together. A new EU platform for joint gas purchases will coordinate the filling of reservoirs. The joint purchase is made on a voluntary basis, except for a mandatory participation of the member countries over at least 15 percent of the gas storage capacity. After the debate, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that some measures, like buying gas together, were easier to implement than others – such as preventing gas price peaks.Development of a new price indexThe member states also agreed to move forward with creating a new gas-price index by early 2023, which is not so easily subject to speculative fluctuations as the current one. Therefore, EU leaders tasked the Commission with developing a complementary price index for liquefied natural gas (LNG) as an alternative to the Dutch Transfer Title Facility (TTF) gas price index, which has been mainly used for pipeline gas in the past. The gas price index serves as a reference price for many natural gas transactions across the bloc.Energy ministersâ€™ meetingThe energy ministers already met on Tuesday to discuss the proposals on the table.Agreement on joint purchasesCroatian Minister for Economy and Sustainable Development Davor FilipoviÄ‡ said a majority of the member states supported joint gas procurement and creating a new exchange index which should stabilize and limit wholesale gas prices. They were also in favor of establishing a price corridor, which would envisage the lowest and highest gas price. Furthermore, EU Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said after the meeting on Tuesday that the EUâ€™s energy ministers supported the proposal by the Commission to make joint purchases of gas operational as of next year. Joint purchases would be the ""most efficient way"" to lower the price of gas in the EU, German Minister for Economic Affairs Robert Habeck said on his arrival to the talks. ""Europe has great market power. If the big players are allowed to collaborate, to form purchasing pools, then Europe's market power will have an impact,"" he stated.Opinions on price cap still differThere was wide support for the ""introduction of dynamic price cap on electricity and gas, which would limit the excessive price spikes in case of a market panic,"" said Czech Industry Minister Jozef Sikela at the press conference after the meeting.However, the ministers ""have rather different viewsâ€ on a mechanism to limit the price of gas traded at the TTF, as previously proposed by the Commission, said Sikela, who chaired the meeting. Bulgaria, for instance, said at the meeting it is in favor of a gas price cap, if the cap covers all imported quantities. ""The main question is how to make sure that capping will still allow us to buy the gas we need on the market,"" Sikela said.Another idea, that of capping the price of gas used by electricity power plants, – a solution vigorously advocated by France, but rejected by Germany – was discussed after the dissemination of a Commission document listing the undesirable effects in the event that this device, currently applied only in Spain and Portugal, became more widespread in the EU.In particular, Brussels points to the risk of inflating European gas consumption, the variable financial cost of the individual states and the danger of subsidizing electricity exported to third countries.""Now, it us up to member states if they will find a solution especially how to well address the flows to third countries and how to agree on the cost-sharing principles,"" stated Commissioner for Energy Kadri Simson at the press conference. ""This analysis is necessary before we [the EU Commission] will make a legislative proposal"" on this mechanism, but ""another necessary precondition â€¦ is broad enough support among member states to take this proposal forward,"" she added.Results in November?For the French Minister of Energy Transition, AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher, ""the ball is in the Commission's court"": the 27 member states ""have given a consensual and unanimous mandate"" to the European executive to ""develop a proposal on this subject very quickly,"" she insisted.Within the Belgian government, which had been pushing for a more ambitious price cap, frustration grows that after months of discussion, the Council is still not able to take concrete decisions, because the Commission still has not put detailed, technical proposals on the table. Belgian Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten now expects the Commission to come forward with proposals concerning a temporary mechanism to limit episodes of excessive gas prices.Croatian Minister for the Economy FilipoviÄ‡ expects an agreement to be reached at the next meeting of energy ministers on November 24. According to Slovenian Infrastructure Minister Borjan Kumer, this will be the last possible day to agree on the measures. ""I would not want to sacrifice quality in order to reach an agreement a week earlier,"" concluded Kumer.After the EU summit, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was certain that a â€œdynamic price corridorâ€ would be introduced. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pointed out that â€œa lot of technical work still needs to be done.â€ According to him, the ministers must take a possible decision on the issue unanimously, otherwise an EU summit will have to deal with it again.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Russia blocks grain exports, 17 billion euros in Russian assets frozen in EU, Ursula von der Leyen visits BiH and the EU agrees to abolish the sale of vehicles with combustion engines by 2035","The EU asked Russia to â€œreverse its decisionâ€ to block grain exports via the Black Sea. EU Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders announced that 17 billion euros of Russian assets are frozen in the EU. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen reiterated during a visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that the countryâ€™s future lies in the EU, and the bloc has agreed to abolish the sale of vehicles with combustion engine by 2035. Ukraine: blocked grain exports, Russia accuses of causing famine risk over blocked grain exportsMoscowÂ (AFP) – The transport of Ukrainian grain in the Black Sea was blocked on Sunday, after Russia suspended the agreement on exports vital for the world's food supply, a decision castigated by Kiev, Washington and the EU. Russia has said that the decision to block grain exports was taken after a drone attack on their ships in Crimea, but Ukraine has denounced this as â€œa false pretextâ€. It called for pressure to be exerted on Russia to â€œrecommit itself to respecting its obligationsâ€ under the agreement reached in July under the aegis of the UN and Turkey, the only one between Moscow and Kiev since the start of the conflict.The Joint Coordination Center (JCC) responsible for overseeing this agreement confirmed that no cargo movements had been approved for Sunday. Nine cargo ships were able to use the Black Sea maritime corridor on Saturday and â€œmore than ten othersâ€ are ready to do the same in both directions. The EU has urged Russia to â€œreverse its decisionâ€, which â€œendangers the main export route of cereals and fertilizers needed to respond to the global food crisis caused by the war.â€ (October 30)Reynders: Seventeen billion euros in Russian assets frozen in the EUBrussels (Belga) – The European Union has frozen 17 billion euros in Russian assets as part of the sanctions package against Russia, said European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders in a newspaper interview. â€œSo far, the assets of 90 people have been frozen, more than 17 billion euros in seven member states, including 2.2 billion in Germany,â€ Reynders added.â€œWe are investigating what else we can do,â€ European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders stated.Since the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine eight months ago, the EU has adopted eight sanctions packages against Russia. Ukrainian politicians in particular have asked several times to use the frozen assets to rebuild the country after the war. â€œWhen it comes to money from crime that the EU seizes, it is possible to transfer it to a compensation fund for Ukraine. But the sum is far from sufficient to finance the reconstruction.â€ As part of Western sanctions, 300 billion euros in Russian central bank reserves have also been frozen. â€œI think it is possible to keep the 300 billion euros as a guarantee until Russia voluntarily helps to rebuild Ukraine,â€ Reynders said. (October 29)Ursula von der Leyen visited BiH and reiterated that the countryâ€™s future lies in the European UnionSarajevo (FENA) – European CommissionÂ President Ursula von der LeyenÂ traveled to Bosnia and Herzegovina as part of her multi-day visit to the Western Balkan countries, where she told the citizens of BiH that they are the future of the European Union and that their future lies in the European Union. During her visit to the country, von der Leyen addressed political representatives in BiH, representatives from civil society and the field of culture as well as the business community, saying that BiH is part of Europe.â€œYou belong to our Union. It was touching to see the European flag on three landmarks in Sarajevo, Banja Luka and Mostar – in honor of our proposal to make BiH a candidate for EU membership. Because our flag will be your flag, too. It belongs in this country. And thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m here today,â€Â Ursula von der Leyen said.She continued that in addition to political action, BiH has a unique opportunity to move forward in this generation. This was a moment for BiH and â€œI want to encourage all of you to take advantage of it. This is the meaning of our recommendation to grant BiH candidate status,â€ stated the President of the European Commission. She added that the last four years have not been easy because of the pandemic, the war in Ukraine and deep political divisions. But even in such difficult circumstances, some progress has been made in BiH in the field of public procurement, in achieving membership of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism and in cooperation with EUROPOL. Von der Leyen pointed out that now was the time to rejoin forces in the country and make progress on the way to the Union. This was the first visit by European Union officials after the Commissionâ€™s recommendation to grant BiH the status of candidate country for membership in the bloc. The final position on candidate status should be given by the European Council in December.The European institutions confirmed the importance of the region for the EU and assured their continued support and solidarity in the face of strategic challenges, von der Leyen added. In this context, she also announced the EUâ€™s intention to involve the countries of the Western Balkans in joint resolutions on the energy crisis on the continent. Members of the Presidency of BiH reiterated their and the countryâ€™s commitment to the European path and the reform process. (29. October)Agreement in the EU to end sale of vehicles with a combustion engine by 2035Brussels/Madrid (EFE) – Negotiators from the European Council, the European Parliament and the European Commission reached an agreement to ban the sale of new cars and vans with a combustion engine starting in 2035. This is the first legislative part of the â€œFit for 55â€ package to decarbonize the EU by 2050 that has been approved. â€œPending formal adoption, the co-legislators agreed on a CO2 emissions reduction target of 55 per cent for new cars and 50 per cent for new vans by 2030 compared to 2021 levelsâ€ and â€œ100 per cent for new cars and vans by 2035,â€ the European Council said in a statement. â€œThe agreement sends a strong signal to the industry and consumers: Europe is embracing the shift to zero-emission mobility. European car manufacturers are already proving they are ready to step up to the plate, with increasingly affordable electric cars coming to the market,â€ said Frans Timmermans, executive vice-president of the European Commission for the European Green Deal.The European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) urged European policymakers to accelerate the deployment of the conditions necessary to make zero-emission mobility possible, since â€œthere is no time to loseâ€, while environmental organizations called for more ambition. For its part, Spain must not make any legal changes to implement the agreement reached. This is because article 14.2 of the Climate Change Act already states that the objective of vehicles with zero emissions will be adapted to that established by EU regulations, the Ministry for Ecological Transition explained to EFE.

Europe's climate ambitions at COP27,"With the 2015 Paris Agreement, the international community committed itself to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius. At the Glasgow summit in 2021, a number of states assured that they would no longer invest into coal, oil and gas. Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine threw many things into disarray. Now, the climate targets are to be improved at the UN's COP27.Russian gas no longer flows to Europe. Germany, for example, is investing billions in new liquefied natural gas terminals on the coast. Coal-fired power plants are put back into operation to secure the electricity supply this winter. Similar things are happening in other parts of Europe. Nevertheless, the EU states assure that they want to meet the EUâ€™s climate protection target, i. e. reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990.Ahead of the UN's COP27 Climate Change Conference, which takes place in Sharm-el-Sheikh, Egypt, from November 6, the EU Parliament calls for more leadership in mitigating climate change. The EU must show leadership and increase its 2030 emission reduction targets, stated a resolution adopted by the EU parliament in October.The EU Parliament called on industrialized countries to increase their climate protection targets, saying that Russia's war against Ukraine and its consequences made it all the more urgent to transform the global energy system. In addition, MEPs requested that the developed countries must keep their promise and ensure that the developing countries receive 100 billion US dollars in funding each year for climate protection.Germany's State Secretary and Special Envoy for International Climate Action at the Federal Foreign Office, Jennifer Morgan, called on the EU to take the leading role at the international conference: â€œThe EU must lead the way in accelerating the energy transition in solidarity with weaker nations.â€ She added that it was also important to keep financial commitments to developing nations and to support countries particularly affected by climate change through a solidarity pact. Germany will double its international funding commitments for environmental protection to 1.5 billion euros per year by 2025 at the latest.EU pledges more than 23 billion euros in climate finance to the Global SouthOn October 28, the Council of the EU announced that the European Union and its 27 member states have pledged 23.04 billion euros in climate finance to the Global South. The funding from public sources aims ""to support developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change,"" a press release read.54 percent of the funds were either earmarked for climate adaptation or for measures tackling both adaptation and climate change mitigation, the statement read, citing European Commission figures. Almost half of the total amount was pledged in the form of grants. International public climate finance aims to support countries of the Global South in implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.Slovenia one of the fastest warming countriesThe targets of the Paris Agreement are increasingly at risk. Slovenia is one of the fastest warming countries. Experts from the Ljubljana Faculty of Mathematics and Physics have calculated that the country already exceeded the two-degree warming limit back in 2020. They warned that if only moderate action was taken, average temperatures in Slovenia could increase by almost five degrees Celsius by the end of the century.Minister of the Environment and Spatial Planning UroÅ¡ BreÅ¾an sees great potential in solar energy. Thereâ€™s also a debate on the potential construction of a second unit at the KrÅ¡ko nuclear power station. The life span of the plant's first unit is to be extended to 2043. Next year, Slovenia is expected to adopt a climate change law, which is to introduce a climate council, a body bringing together experts, political players and NGOs in a bid to find the most suitable measures to mitigate climate change.The country expects the COP27 Climate Conference to focus on issues concerning the developing countries. Environment Minister BreÅ¾an, who will attend the conference in Sharm El Sheikh, said that the issue of financing will always arise in the relationship between developed and developing countries. The promise that developing countries would receive 100 billion US dollars in climate aid a year had not been kept. ""I believe we can make progress there. Slovenia, as a developed country, is committed to making a greater effort,"" BreÅ¾an said.Serbiaâ€™s climate promiseSerbia has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 33.3 percent by 2030 and announced that by the end of this year, the country will publish the first National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change in Serbia. The country aims to abandon fossil fuels in favor of renewable energy sources, as well as switch to a circular economy model and reduce waste.The EU delegation in Serbia welcomed the countryâ€™s increased climate ambition and called for the adoption of long-term strategies for climate neutrality by 2050. The head of the EU Delegation in Serbia, Emanuele Giaufret, said that ""the EU will provide direct budget support in the amount of 165 million euros to mitigate the energy crisis. In parallel, the EU supports Serbia in increasing the energy efficiency of public and private facilities and the share of renewable energy sources.â€Ahead of the UN Climate Summit COP27, the Digital Climate Atlas of Serbia was presented in Belgrade. The online platform is based on meteorological and geospatial data, providing insights into current and future climate changes for the entire territory of Serbia.Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s dependence on thermal power plantsSerbiaâ€™s neighbor Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) became a member of the UN Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in December 2000. However, for its electricity supply, BiH is still dependent on thermal power plants, which are major polluters. Authorities in the country have approved the continued operation of two thermal power plants, one in Tuzla and the other in Kakanj, whose service life has expired. This is to maintain stability in electricity production. BiH authorities had previously pledged that these plants would not operate for more than 20,000 hours after January 1, 2018.The Energy Community (EC), an international organization of the EU and several third states, initiated proceedings against Bosnia and Herzegovina for violating the regulations. The EC states that pollution protection systems have not been modernized as required and that the continued operation of the two thermal power plants violates the EUâ€™s Large Combustion Plant Directive (LCPD) as well as BiHâ€™s own national plan for the reduction of harmful gas emissions. The Energy Community has to ensure that signatory states commit themselves to liberalizing their energy markets according to the requirements of the acquis and the EU Treaty.According to the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Bosnia and Herzegovina generated 42.3 percent of its total energy from renewable sources in 2021.Europe one of the fastest-heating regions in the world despite progress in emission reductionMeanwhile, according to a joint report by the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the European Union's Copernicus Climate Change Service, temperatures in Europe have increased by more than twice the global average over the past three decades, making it the fastest-warming of all continents.However, according to preliminary figures, emissions from the 27 EU states fell by 32 percent between 1990 and 2020, which means that the climate target of a 20 percent reduction by 2020 was clearly achieved, states a report published by the European Environment Agency (EEA) on October 26.The experts at the Copenhagen-based EU agency wrote that the annual progress would have to be more than doubled on the way towards meeting the more ambitious climate and energy targets for 2030. Emissions would have to decrease by an average of 134 million tons of CO2 per year, or 4 percent, to meet the target of reducing emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990.For WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas, ""Europe presents a vivid picture of a warming world and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from the effects of extreme weather events."" But the WMO also notes that it's not all bad news: ""Europe can play a key role in achieving a carbon-neutral society by mid-century to meet the Paris Agreement,"" said Petteri Taalas. For Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, ""European society is vulnerable to climate variability and climate change, but Europe is also at the forefront of international efforts to mitigate climate change and develop innovative solutions to adapt to the new climate that Europeans will have to live with.""This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Europe is warming twice as fast as world average, UN extends EU mission in BiH and Berlin warns Belgrade","Europe is warming twice as fast as the world average. The UN Security Council extended the mandate of the EU mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and Berlin warns Belgrade of too close ties with Russia. Europe is warming twice as fast as the world averageMadrid (Europa Press) â€” A report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) shows that Europe has warmed at twice the rate of the average global temperature increase in the last 30 years, despite the fact that the continent, in particular the European Union, cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 31% from 1990 to 2020 and has set a net emission reduction target of 55% by 2030.In the words of the Secretary General of the WMO, Petteri Taalas, â€œEurope is the living reflection of a world that is warming and reminds us that even well-prepared societies are not safe from the consequences of extreme weather events.â€ The expert insists, however, that Europe must maintain the right pace in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and must set itself more ambitious goals.The publication of this report comes a few days before the start of the XXVII Conference of the Parties to the United Nations on Climate Change (COP27), which will begin next week in Sharm-El Sheikh (Egypt). (November 2)UN Security Council unanimously extends mandate of EUFOR mission in BiHNew York (FENA) – The United Nations Security Council unanimously adopted a draft resolution on Bosnia and Herzegovina extending the mandate of EUFOR ALTHEA, a multinational stabilizing force led by the European Union, in BiH. Bosnia and Herzegovina was the only topic of the UN Security Council meeting, which discussed threats to the peace and security of BiH.Russia had long announced a veto on the extension of EUFORâ€™s mandate, but changed its decision following messages, notably by the leader of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) Milorad Dodik, that it was in the interest of Republika Srpska to keep EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The report of the High Representative of the International Community in BiH Christian Schmidt was read at the session. BiH Ambassador to the UN Sven Alkalaj accused Schmidt of violating the Dayton Peace Agreement and destabilizing BiHâ€™s constitution.â€œThe High Representative deceived all voters in BiH, because they surely would have voted differently if they had been familiar with the new electoral rules. He also deceived all actors in the elections, more precisely all political parties and independent candidates, who would certainly have offered different electoral lists and programs that would have complied with the new electoral rules,â€ stated Alkalaj, referring to the decisions on an electoral reform which was imposed by Schmidt in the night of the elections.Alkalaj also alleged that Schmidt had imposed amendments to the Election Law of BiH, which are evaluated through a mathematical formula and a coefficient for participation in the electoral process determined in accordance with the nationality of the voting body. He said that Schmidt had been planning and doing all this in cooperation with Croatia and accused him of a selective implementation of the judgments of the Constitutional Court of BiH.The United States supported High Representative Christian Schmidtâ€™s decision to change the election law in the election night on October 2, while noting that they also support his report presented to the Security Council.â€œBonn powers are a key tool for maintaining stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the region. The imposition was necessary to prevent the collapse of the Federation of BiH. The High Representative has a key role,â€ U.S. Representative Jeffrey DeLaurentis assessed.The â€œBonn powersâ€ are the powers granted to the High Representative in 1997. They include the power to adopt binding decisions and remove officials from office.French Representative to the Security Council Nathalie Broadhurst Estival deemed the retention of political blockades inadmissible, including those that prevent the constitution of power in the Federation of BiH after the elections. France, the US and the UK clearly condemned all calls for BiH secession, as well as the glorification of war criminals at the Security Councilâ€™s session.As opposed to this, Russian Representative Anna Evstigneeva said that the Security Council should not consider Schmidtâ€™s report at all, but that the report sent by the authorities of BiHâ€™s entity Republika Srpska was the one that spoke about the real problems in BiH. (November 2)Berlin cautions Belgrade against ties with RussiaBerlin (AFP) – Berlin has warned Serbia about its close ties to Russia, which could complicate the countryâ€™s rapprochement with the EU, a German government source said on Tuesday.Two days before a summit in Berlin aimed at strengthening EU cooperation with six countries located in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia), this German source referred to â€œthe light and the shadowâ€ of the Serbian case.â€œSerbiaâ€™s relations with Russia are certainly on the dark side,â€ the source said. In particular, it cited the agreement signed at the end of September by Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and his then Serbian counterpart Nikola Selakovic on continuing consultations between the two ministries for the next two years.â€œWe were surprised and disappointed,â€ the German source admitted.Although Serbia condemned Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine at the UN, it refuses to comply with European sanctions against Moscow.

Posts misinterpret European nations' withdrawal from fossil fuel treaty: experts,"Legal experts say a claim shared across social media misleadingly suggests that several European nations, including France and the Netherlands, have withdrawn from a decades-old Energy Charter Treaty (ETC) because they are ""jumping ship on climate commitments"". In fact, the experts say, France and the Netherlands announced that a proposed amendment to the treaty does not accord with the Paris Agreement, making it ""incompatible with (their) climate goals"". The misleading claim was shared by Ice Age Farmer, a Telegram channel that frequently shares anti-net-zero messages (see here and here) on October 22.The post includes a screenshot of a tweet by Bart-Jaap Verbeek, a researcher at the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) in the Netherlands on October 19.The post reads, â€œBREAKING: Dutch Minister Jetten just announced that the Netherlands has decided to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty (ETC).â€Following the screenshot, the Telegram message reads, â€œEU nations are jumping ship on climate commitments as the #EnergyCrisis gets real and winter hits. First France this morning and now the Netherlands are exiting agreements â€¦Itâ€™s amazing how fast these charades disintegrate upon contact with reality, just as the ESG narrative is crumbling when profits werenâ€™t there.â€A screenshot of the misleading post, captured on October 31The ETC, involving 52 nations mainly from Central Asia and Europe, was initially signed in 1994 to protect energy investments in volatile ex-Soviet countries.It allows energy companies to sue governments over energy policy changes, which exposes states to multi-billion-dollar compensation claims.On June 24, 2022, the European Union struck a compromise deal to update the treaty after two years of discussions. One of the new terms of the modernised treaty excludes new fossil fuel investments from protections and institutes a 10-year phase-out period for protections on existing investments.The Telegram post has since been spread by a QAnon telegram channel, an unregistered Australian party founded by conspiracy theorist Riccardo Bosi, and social media users from the Netherlands, Sweden, the US, Brazil and the Philippines.However, the claim is misleading, legal experts told AFP.Rachel Thrasher, a law lecturer at Boston University, told AFP that the claim seems to be ""completely the opposite"" of the countries' motive for withdrawing from the ETC.""Leaving the Energy Charter Treaty is a move to make policy space for more, better and more effective climate commitments,"" she said. ""French and Dutch government officials have noted that the treaty is incompatible with climate goals (to the extent that their policies phasing out fossil fuels can be challenged in arbitration).""Lukas Schaugg, legal analyst at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), told AFP that European nations are not ""jumping ship"" on climate commitments.""Leaving the ECT is currently the most viable option to ensure that states have the regulatory freedom to pursue the clean energy transition in the next decades,"" he said.""The fact that these EU member states are now publicly announcing withdrawals is a clear sign that they reject the outcome of the negotiations promoted by the European Commission as not ambitious enough in climate terms.""Incompatible with Paris AgreementThe posts also misrepresent what EU leaders and ministers have said about their reasons for withdrawing from the treaty.Rob Jetten, the Netherlands' Minister for Climate and Energy Policy, told parliament on October 18 that it was withdrawing because the ETC was not in line with the Paris agreement.""The mandate for the European Commission was to bring the ECT in line with the Paris climate agreement,"" he said. ""Despite many of the modernisations that are now in the negotiation outcome, we do not see how the ECT has been sufficiently aligned with the Paris Agreement.""Following the Netherlands' withdrawal, France also pulled out of the treaty on October 21.French President Emmanuel Macron said the move was done to be more ""coherent"" with the Paris climate accord to combat global warming.""And today I am watching with concern as we return not just to transitional energies, but to hydrocarbons and the most polluting fossil fuels,"" he said in a press conference. ""And so the war on European soil must not make us forget our climate commitments and our imperative to reduce our CO2 emissions. Withdrawing from this treaty is part of this strategy.""France has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050.In October this year, the United Nations warned the world was nowhere near the Paris Agreement target of capping warming at 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, AFP reported.Back in February, in a report dubbed an ""atlas of human suffering"", the UN's climate experts warned that global warming is outpacing our preparations for a world blighted by climate change.Growing pressureThe updated ETC agreement was meant to come into force in November if none of the signatories object, but still has to be approved on the EU side by the European Parliament and member states, AFP has reported.Thrasher said if the parties did not agree with the modernised text, the treaty would stay as it is.She said, ""It is unclear whether the EU even has the competency to sign the treaty and bind its member states to the commitments when they have individually opted out.""Schaugg said, ""The more EU member states announce withdrawals, the higher the pressure on the European Commission to change its stance and start planning for and implementing a coordinated withdrawal of the EU from the ECT.""However, even though the countries have left, members remain bound by a ""sunset clause"", which means they can still be sued by energy companies after quitting the treaty.Thrasher said EU countries still have the option to neutralise the clause if they make a new agreement.""If countries do not wish to be sued (by fossil fuel companies or anyone else), they can make a subsequent agreement among themselves that nullifies the sunset clause,"" she said.Kate TANAll articlesAFP AustraliaAll articlesCLIMATEFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: EU to modernize budget rules, Italy prevents asylum seekers from disembarking from rescue ships, numerous arrests during joint EU police action against traffickers using the Balkan route","The EU Commission is expected to announce a reform of old budget rules aiming to strengthen public accounts and enable investments. What also happened this week: The new Italian government has prevented some asylum seekers from disembarking from rescue ships, while children and sick people were allowed into the country. Also: EU countries joined forces to target drug and firearms smuggling as well as migrant trafficking along the Balkan route.Brussels seeks to modernize its complex and outdated budget rulesBrussels (AFP) – On Wednesday, the European Commission is set to unveil its plan to reform the EUâ€™s old budget rules to enable massive investments and strengthen the reliability of public accounts.â€œIt is time to move forward. If we donâ€™t do it now, when will we do it?â€ asked European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni.These rules, gathered in the Stability and Growth Pact, were suspended in early 2020 to avoid a collapse of the European economy affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Faced with a historic recession, deficits were expected.Now that the storm has passed, and despite the war in Ukraine, the Pact is to be reactivated at the end of 2023, even though the crisis has caused the debt levels of the most fragile countries to explode and the Pact is no longer applicable as it stands.The Stability Pact is an instrument adopted by the countries of the euro area in 1997, in preparation for the introduction of the single currency on 1 January 1999. It is a response to Germany's concern that member countries would pursue lax budgetary policies, and thus imposes the objective of balanced accounts. (November 7, 2022)Frail people disembark from NGO ships, clash over who staysVolunteers carry a migrant is carried in a chair to disembark from the rescue ship ""Geo Barents"" of international NGO Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on November 6, 2022 in the port of Catania, Sicily. (Photo by Giovanni ISOLINO / AFP)Catania (ANSA) – 144 people left the rescue ship Humanity 1, but 35 remained on board. And for 100 fragile passengers from the lifeboat Geo Barents, disembarkation in Catania has begun as well. But there is a clash over those who cannot disembark, as stipulated by the government's decree on migration flows. The commander of Humanity 1, Joachim Ebeling, said that they have been â€œordered to leave the port of Catania. But I canâ€™t, we must find a solution hereâ€ because ""it would be against the law to leave with the survivors, as my lawyer explained to me.""For Doctors Without Borders, ""a rescue operation can only be considered finished once all the survivors have disembarked in a safe place."" The NGO states that ""selective and partial disembarkation, such as proposed by the Italian authorities, is not to be considered legal according to the conventions of maritime law."" They recall that ""the government should take all necessary measures to ensure that the survivors remain on board for as short a time as possible, according to the Guidelines on the Treatment of Persons Rescued at Sea."" The first passengers to disembark from the Geo Barents were minors and young children: 56 unaccompanied minors and 3 women have disembarked already.While attending an event in Venice, Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi was challenged by some members of the NGO Mediterranea. The Democratic Party is calling for the head of the ministry to report back to parliament. A step towards an agreement on the redistribution of migrants landed in Italy could come from France, which is finalizing the modalities for the reception of those migrants. This is a confirmation of the willingness expressed by Minister Gerald Darmanin: â€œWe have told Italy, and we say this with Germany, that if that humanitarian vessel (Ocean Viking) will be welcomed by Italy, we will also host part of the migrants, of women and children, so that Italy isnâ€™t burdened on its own by this arrival of migrants.""Deputy Premier and Infrastructure Minister Matteo Salvini said Monday that it was time to stop â€œorganized tripsâ€ for migrantsÂ across the Mediterranean as a stand-off continued over people saved at sea by NGO-run search-and-rescue ships. â€œThese are organized trips,â€ said Salvini, who imposed a closed-ports policy on NGO-run ships when was interior minister between 2018 and 2019 in the first government of ex-premier Giuseppe Conte. Meanwhile, Cataniaâ€™s Public Prosecutor's Office has opened an investigation into the possible presence of traffickers on the Humanity 1 and Geo Barents ships. The mobile squad's investigation aims to identify possible crew members of the boats rescued by NGOs in the Mediterranean.

(Photo by OLIVER BUNIC / AFP)Brussels (Belga) – Police, customs, immigration services and border security agencies, among others, were deployed in the EMPACT coordinated action days, which took place from Wednesday 26 to Saturday 29 October. The focus was primarily on tightening controls at the EUâ€™s external borders, especially in the Balkans and elsewhere in south-eastern Europe. Other countries contributed to the operation through intelligence or have carried out actions at a national level.Of the 382 people arrested, 159 are suspected of being involved in human trafficking. There are also 112 people suspected of drug trafficking and 38 of arms trafficking. In addition, 106 firearms, 304 kilograms of heroin and 147 kg of cannabis were seized. 130 new investigations were launched based on the arrests and the evidence obtained.Nearly 16,000 agents participated in the multi-day campaign. Together, they have checked more than 30,000 vehicles, nearly 75,000 people and more than 2,000 packages. Just under a thousand locations were also searched.The so-called Balkan route is an important logistics hub. Every day, thousands of trucks drive into the EU via the Balkan countries with numerous goods, such as food and construction materials. But international criminal networks also use the border crossings to illegally smuggle people, weapons or drugs into the EU.

Europe in brief: Bosnia and Herzegovina stressed the relevance of action against global warming at COP27. Slovakia fell two places in the Rule of Law Index. What else was important: The only Slovenian nuclear plant is put back into operation.,"COP27: Participants from Bosnia and Herzegovina stressed the relevance of action against global warming. According to the Rule of Law Index 2022, Slovakia fell two places. The only Slovenian nuclear plant is put back into operation. COP27: Call for a more serious approach to mitigate global warming Sharm El-Sheikh (FENA) – Members of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina and members of the Green Club SaÅ¡a MagazinoviÄ‡ and Jasmin EmriÄ‡ attended this yearâ€™s United Nations (UN) conference on climate change (COP27) in Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt. This key global event that gathers world leaders takes place in a year marked by natural disasters across the planet, but also at a time of major geopolitical tensions, which further enhances its importance – along with the fact that more than 120 heads of state attended COP27.At this year's COP, numerous round tables and meetings were organized through the plenary session. On the sidelines of the event, there were discussion about the challenges the world faces in implementing the commitments  made in the context of reducing emissions on the way to carbon neutrality: water and food security, fair transition and the protection of agriculture.MagazinoviÄ‡ called for a more serious approach by the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) and the fulfillment of the obligations assumed to mitigate global warming, but also for a positioning of green policies on the list of priority topics on the political agenda. He also urged political actors in BiH to draft program documents on these topics, on the basis of which future coalitions can be formed. So far, BiHâ€™s commitment has not been adequate, which was also indicated by the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina was one of the few countries in the world that was not represented at COP27 at the presidential, prime ministerial or ministerial level, MagazinoviÄ‡ pointed out. (November 7)Slovakia fell two places in the global index of the rule of lawBratislava (TASR) – According to the international organization World Justice Project, Slovakia dropped two places in the Rule of Law Index 2022 as compared to last year. The country landed in 35th place worldwide. According to the Amercian Chamber of Commerce in Slovakia (AmCham), Slovakia is 15 points behind the Czech Republic.The World Justice Project evaluated 140 countries and jurisdictions around the world. According to AmCham, the level of the rule of law has declined for the fifth year in a row in most countries. The index evaluated country data based on eight factors, namely the limitation of government power, the level of corruption, open government, basic rights, order and safety, enforcement of legal regulations, as well as justice in civil and criminal matters. Slovakiaâ€™s ranking suffered in particular from the unfavorable score in the categories corruption and civil justice. (November 8)The only Slovenian nuclear plant is reconnected to the electricity systemKrÅ¡ko (STA) – The only Slovenian nuclear power plant, Nuklearna elektrarna KrÅ¡ko (Nek), was restarted and reconnected to the power grid on November 7, after a maintenance break that lasted just over one month. In this period, comprehensive testing was carried out and almost half of the fuel elements were replaced. After checks at a low level of power generation, the plantâ€™s power production will be increased gradually. The next overhaul of the KrÅ¡ko nuclear power plant after the current 18-month fuel cycle will take place in the spring of 2024. During the overhaul of Nek, which contributes about one third of electricity to the countryâ€™s grid, Slovenia obtained power from hydroelectric plants and imports. The sixth block of the Å oÅ¡tanj Thermal Power Plant, which usually contributes 35 percent of Sloveniaâ€™s electricity needs, is expected to be temporarily shut down until the middle of November in order to save on coal.

Knocking on Schengen's doorÂ ,"The Schengen Area, the largest border control-free travel area in the world, should soon expand to include at least one new member, if not three. So far, the area consists of 22 EU member states and four non-EU countries. Now three more EU members are knocking on Schengenâ€™s door â€“ Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. Of the 27 EU member states, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia, Cyprus and Ireland are currently not part of the Schengen area. On the other hand, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein, which are not members of the EU, are included. The Czech Presidency of the Council of the EU has indicated that it wants Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania to join the border control-free Schengen zone together. Therefore it has put the topic on its agenda. It is expected that the Council of the EU will vote on it on December 9. The accession of new countries to Schengen requires a unanimous decision.The youngest EU member Croatia, which joined in 2013, is on the verge of adopting the euro. Croatia is on the right track to becoming a member of the Schengen Area, given that so far there have been no announcements, at least no public ones, from any Schengen member that would veto. So it seems that Croatia is well on its way to joining the area without internal border controls from the beginning of next yearRomania and Bulgaria have been waiting since 2011. The Council of the EU and the EU Parliament confirmed in June 2011 that Bulgaria and Romania met all the criteria for joining Schengen. However, in September of that year, the Netherlands and Finland vetoed the countriesâ€™ accession, citing insufficient action against corruption and organized crime as the reason. On October 18, 2022 – for the fourth time since 2018 – the EU Parliament called on the member states in the Council of the EU to integrate Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen zone without delay.Dutch blockade of Romania and BulgariaHowever, the Netherlands continue to question the readiness of Bulgaria and Romania. In October 2022, the Dutch Parliament adopted a resolution to oppose the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Schengen Area. It stressed the need for further analysis of the functioning of the rule of law and deemed it necessary to check whether and to what extent corruption and organized crime had been reduced in these two countries. â€œIf these issues are unresolved in a Schengen state, this can cause serious problems in the absence of border controls and thus represents a risk for the security of the Netherlands and the entire Schengen Areaâ€, the resolution states.Bulgariaâ€™s President Rumen Radev commented on October 21: â€œThe elections in the Netherlands are taking place in spring. This is a difficult topic, but the Netherlands are already isolated in the Council. Bulgaria and Romania are taken hostage to domestic politics in the Netherlands, and this will not last long.â€Due to widespread corruption, the legal authorities in Romania and Bulgaria have been specially monitored by the EU Commission since their accession to the bloc in 2007. The EU Parliament described the current arrangements as harmful to the European Single Market. â€œMaintaining internal border controls is discriminatory and has a serious impact on the lives of mobile workers and citizens,â€ MEPs said.Romania still believes in Schengen accessionRomaniaâ€™s Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu believes that there is still room for political, diplomatic and technical steps. â€œI am convinced that the Dutch side is evaluating absolutely all options and variants,â€ Aurescu said.According to MEP Victor Negrescu, there are three potential scenarios with regard to Romaniaâ€™s Schengen accession. The first scenario would be a positive vote on Romaniaâ€™s accession to the Schengen Area by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on December 9. In this case, the Netherlands, if they remained the last country without a clear position, would vote in favour of accession, but with the imposition of conditions, perhaps supported by other European countries. They could ask the EU Commission to develop a special monitoring mechanism, under which some of the rights specific to the Schengen Area could be suspended if certain provisions were violated.In the second scenario the vote would be rescheduled to an extraordinary session of the Council later this year, to await the conclusions of the latest Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report and the opinion of the Venice Commission on the Justice Laws. The Commission established the CVM as a transitional measure to help Romania address deficiencies in the field of justice and in taking action against corruption. In this case, Romaniaâ€™s entry into the Schengen zone would still be conditional on criteria that have nothing to do with the Schengen acquis. The decoupling of the decision on Bulgaria from that on Romania is also being evaluated, says the Romanian MEP.In the third scenario the vote on Romaniaâ€™s and Bulgariaâ€™s entry into the Schengen Area could be rescheduled until after the elections in the Netherlands in March 2023 have taken place.Croatia expects to join Schengen in 2023As far as Croatia is concerned, the Council of the European Union initiated the decision-making process on the admission of the country to the Schengen area back in June, requesting the opinion of the European Parliament. Although this opinion is not binding on the Council, it is a required procedural step and also sends a political message. The Council of the EU proposed to abolish controls where Croatia borders with Schengen countries on land and sea from January 1, 2023. Controls at airports are to follow suit from March 26, 2023.At the plenary session on November 10, the European Parliament voted in favor of Croatiaâ€™s entry into Schengen. This was the penultimate step towards the final decision, which is expected on December 9 at the meeting of the interior ministers of the member states.Slovenia and Croatia – three decades of border disputeSlovenia supports Croatiaâ€™s membership of the Schengen Area. However, the fate of the border arbitration agreement of 2017 is uncertain. This agreement determined the course of the land and sea border, after the two countries failed to find a solution themselves for more than two decades.Croatia now insists that it is no longer a party to the arbitration, since there had been procedural irregularities perpetrated by Slovenia. Ljubljana, on the other hand, insists that the arbitral award is the final judgment on the course of the border.Slovenian politicians have often more or less openly discussed the possibility of making Croatiaâ€™s Schengen zone membership conditional on the implementation of the border arbitral award. In recent weeks, rumours have surfaced that the Slovenian government is drafting a unilateral statement to the effect that by joining the Schengen Area, Croatia is accepting the arbitral award. â€œWe are talking about the adoption of a statement, but this statement will be nothing but a renewed commitment to the implementation of the arbitral award,â€ Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said last week. Fajon, who expects a positive political decision regarding Croatiaâ€™s Schengen Area membership by the EUâ€™s Interior Ministers, also announced that the Slovenian government will soon adopt a draft position that will then be put to a vote at the parliament in Ljubljana.Non-EU-member Bosnia and Herzegovina worries about â€œreinforcedâ€ borderCroatia joining Schengen is a particular challenge for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which shares almost a thousand kilometers of border with Croatia. There are strong economic, cultural and familial connections between the two countries. BiH fears that Schengen rules might â€œreinforceâ€œ the border between the two neighboring countries.Tradesmen expect problems in the speed of flow of goods across the border with Croatia. There are nine border checkpoints between BiH and Croatia and 20 permanent crossings for cross-border traffic. Out of the nine checkpoints, only two have the special status to perform phytosanitary controls. These are used to export fruit, vegetables and all other goods that require this type of inspection. The Foreign Trade Chamber of BiH warned on several occasions that the implementation of Schengen inspection standards may create waiting lines and delays of trucks carrying goods that are exported from BiH. They call for better adjustment to new circumstances during border crossing.Nevertheless, the BiH Border Police state that there should not be any significant changes for BiH citizens entering Croatia. What they see as an advantage of Croatia joining Schengen is better supervision of a shared border that has been burdened by the migrant crisis. â€œCroatiaâ€™s membership of Schengen would ensure the meeting of all criteria and thereby a very high level of security of the countryâ€™s external borders. This is especially significant in the prevention of all forms of cross-border crime and illegal crossings in the context of the current migrant crisis,â€ BiH Border Police told FENA.Supported by the EU, Croatia has invested in border protection. The countryâ€™s borders are guarded by 6,500 police officers. Non-governmental organizations and media repeatedly reported on violent returns and inhumane treatment of illegal migrants by Croatian authorities. As a result, the country – in cooperation with civil society organizations – initiated an independent supervision of border police behaviour towards migrants and asylum seekers. Such supervision mechanisms, according to the proposal of the Commission of the European Pact on Migration and Asylum, should be in place in all member states.This article is published Fridays.

Donald Trump's midterm election fraud claims debunked,"In a series of posts on his Truth Social platform, Donald Trump on November 8, 2022 claimed midterm elections were being stolen from Republicans, accusing vote officials of enabling fraud. The allegations do not stand up; despite some isolated problems at several polling sites, voting proceeded.Trump's remarks concerned three highly contested states, but eventually centered on Maricopa County in Arizona, culminating in him uploading a video statement.Trump was not on the ballot, but a Republican victory in the midterms was expected to hasten an announcement that he intends to run for the White House again in 2024. After his election day statements, however, Republicans polled weaker than expected. Results are expected to leave the party with a slim majority in the House of Representatives. With no clear winner of a Senate seat in Georgia requiring a runoff on December 6, the upper chamber of Congress could be in the balance for at least a month.AFP fact checks key quotes from Trump's Truth Social activity.- Delays in Maricopa County -""Don't leave your line. They say that the machines aren't working. They want to delay you out of voting and you cannot allow them to delay you out of voting,"" Trump said in the video.Screenshot taken on November 9, 2022 of three Truth Social posts from Donald TrumpScreenshot taken on November 9, 2022 of a video posted by Donald Trump on Truth SocialEarly on election day, officials in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, said about 20 percent of 223 polling stations there were experiencing difficulties, but insisted it would not affect the probity of the poll.The problems, however, fed rancor online, with a tweet from Trump acolyte and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk claiming a ""2 hour wait minimum at most polling places in Maricopa."" That claim preceded Trump's remarks about alleged delays.In response, Maricopa County on its official Twitter account uploaded a screenshot of Kirk's tweet and said: ""No part of the tweet below is accurate. The vast majority of Vote Centers are seeing wait times under 30 minutes.""Regarding problems with machines, the county added: ""Whether by tabulator or secure ballot box, all voters are being served.""The Maricopa County Elections Department also weighed in, tweeting: ""Right now, 111 polling locations have no wait times."" The department included a link to voting locations to try and direct citizens to sites without wait times.Shortly before his video, Trump posted: ""They are trying to steal the election with bad Machines and DELAY. Don't let it happen!""The claim of a stolen election echoes what Trump said in 2020, when he lost the presidency to Joe Biden. Dozens of court cases in which Trump and other Republicans alleged fraud were thrown out in the months that followed his loss.On Tuesday, a Maricopa County judge denied a request from Republican candidates and groups, including the Republican National Committee, to extend polling hours in response to the problems with voting machines, saying he had not seen evidence that citizens were precluded from voting.- Michigan and Pennsylvania -Using the words ""complete Voter Integrity DISASTER"" and citing Detroit and Pennsylvania, Trump said irregularities were ""not being covered by the Fake News Media!""In relation to Detroit, the claim relates to e-pollbooks, which are used to confirm by poll workers that a voter is registered and has not been issued or has not cast an absentee ballot.Trump posted: ""The Absentee Ballot situation in Detroit is REALLY BAD. People are showing up to Vote only to be told, 'sorry, you have already voted.' This is happening in large numbers, elsewhere as well. Protest, Protest, Protest!""In response, the Michigan Department of State said in a statement that ""in a few instances this morning upon checking in a voter"" error messages had been displayed when reconciling a hand ballot with an absentee ballot already issued, but the issue had been fixed on site. ""In all circumstances, eligible voters were able to vote,"" the statement added.For weeks, officials in Pennsylvania -- which does not allow mail-in ballots to be processed before Election Day -- have said a result would take longer to tabulate. Trump however posted: ""Pennsylvania just announced that it could take days to determine the winner. This is outrageous!""Despite those fears of a delayed result, US television networks called Pennsylvania's US Senate race in favor of John Fetterman, saying in the early hours of November 9 that he had defeated Mehmet Oz, a Dr and television host, who Trump had supported.Arthur MacMillanAll articlesBill MCCARTHYAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesUS POLITICS Donald TrumpFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyTrainingContactCorrectionsMedia / Corporate offersFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: Austrian Foreign Minister says EU's migration system is not working, France wants Europe â€œto speak outâ€ over Ocean Viking case, Brussels congratulates first female Slovenian President Pirc Musar, Belgium and eurozone enter recession and Hungary offers judicial reforms","Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg says the EUâ€™s migration system has failed. France demands consequences for Italyâ€™s refusal to welcome the ship Ocean Viking and the 230 migrants on board. The EU Commission congratulates the first female President of Slovenia, predicts the start of a recession for Belgium and the eurozone and says Hungary is ready to reform its judicial system in exchange for aid from the corona funds. Migration – Schallenberg: The system is not workingBrussels (APA) – In view of rising numbers of migrants, Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Austrian Peopleâ€™s Party/Ã–VP) sees a system failure in the EU. â€œIt is clear that the system is not working,â€ said the Foreign Minister on November 11, ahead of a meeting with his EU colleagues in Brussels. â€œMeasured in terms of population, we receive the second highest number of asylum applications in Europe,â€ Schallenberg added.Austriaâ€™s current migrant figures are higher than ever before and also exceed those of all neighboring countries. At the same time, Austria is surrounded by Schengen and EU states. â€œThis shows that the system as such doesnâ€™t work. Thus there must be no prohibitions on thinking. We have to discuss all ideas openly.â€Schallenberg regretted that discussion about migration in the EU was repeatedly politicized and emotionalized. With regard to the recent Italian-French dispute, there is the feeling of â€œGroundhog Day.â€ The discussions of 2015 and 2016 are being repeated.There are actually good elements in the migration package proposed by the EU Commission to reform the European asylum system, he said. On the basis of a system of â€œsolidarity and responsibility,â€ an agreement could be reached, said Schallenberg. â€œIt is simply a question of political will, and some Member States see no need to make any compromises here.â€Schallenberg sees various interests as the cause of the EU migration crisis. According to him, there are countries that want to allow incoming migrants to move on as quickly as possible. Quotas and distribution are the wrong approach. If these measures were applied, one would have to come to the conclusion that [other countries] would then have to take on migrants who had initially come to Austria, Schallenberg said. â€œAs long as we are in an eternal circle between quotas and non-quotas, we wonâ€™t get anywhere,â€ the Foreign Minister added. (November 14)Ocean Viking: France â€œasks Europe to decideâ€ with regard to ItalyParis (AFP) – France has asked â€œEurope to decide very quickly on the action to be takenâ€ for Italyâ€™s refusal to welcome the ship Ocean Viking and the 230 migrants on board, government spokesman Olivier VÃ©ran said on November 13.On November 11, the ambulance boat of the NGO SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e operating off the coast of Libya landed survivors in France for the first time. An exceptional welcome, out of a â€œduty to humanityâ€, according to French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin.On November 13, on French television, government spokesman Olvier VÃ©ran once again criticized â€œthe unilateral, unacceptable (â€¦) ineffective and unfair decision on the part of the current Italian government, which calls for European responses.â€â€œThe first response was humanitarian and it is done,â€ he continued.â€œThe second response is to remind Italy of its obligations, and if they refuse, to consider any useful measures,â€ added Olivier VÃ©ran, before criticizing Italy for dismissing its responsibility â€œtowards its neighbors and French friends.â€ (November 13)Brussels congratulates Slovenian President elect Pirc MusarBrussels (STA) – On November 13, for the first time in the countryâ€™s history, the presidential elections in Slovenia were won by a woman. With around percent support, 54-year-old lawyer NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar defeated her rival candidate, center-right politician AnÅ¾et Logar, in the second round of voting. Among the first to congratulate Pirc Musar was the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.She wrote on Twitter that as the first woman in a presidential position in Slovenia, Pirc Musar was paving the way for future generations. Von der Leyen also pointed out that she was looking forward to their cooperation. â€œWe share the goal of an even stronger, democratic and resilient union,â€ she wrote.The new President of Slovenia, who will take office on 23 December, was also congratulated by the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management, Janez LenarÄiÄ. He wished her â€œsuccessful performance of this important function, especially in advocating fundamental European values, which are also Slovenian.â€On November 13 after her election, Pirc Musar stressed that with her victory Slovenia won a president who believes in the EU and the democratic values on which it was founded. She believes that all countries in the Western Balkans have to get a place in the EU. According to her, Slovenia will support the entry of these countries into the EU. â€œI see the EU as a building block, as a pillar of peace. The latest developments in the Western Balkans show us that not everything is quite peaceful there yet,â€ she explained. (November 13)Belgium enters recession together with the eurozoneBrussels (Belga) – Like the eurozone as a whole, Belgium will also enter a recession, the European Commission predicted on November 11. On November 11, the Commission published its detailed economic growth outlook for the EU, the eurozone and the individual member states. Like most countries, Belgium is entering a recession, it said.Over the whole of this year, according to the Commission, the Belgian economy will still grow by 2.8 percent. This is completely due to a strong first half of the year and the effect of the relaxed coronavirus measures. In 2021, growth had amounted to 6.1 percent.In the second half of this year, however, high inflation and declining consumer confidence weighed heavily on growth. It fell to -0.1 percent in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, growth will also be negative at -0.4 percent, which means that Belgium officially falls into a recession.During the first quarter of next year, economic productivity is expected to stagnate (+0.0 percent), only to pick up slightly in the second quarter. Throughout 2023, the Commission expects a growth rate of 0.2 percent for Belgium, which is forecast to rise to 1.5 percent by 2024.Inflation is â€œexceptionally highâ€ in Belgium at 10.4 percent this year, the Commission said. By comparison, the annual 8.5 percent inflation rate for the eurozone as a whole is much lower. Only five countries are recording higher price increases than Belgium, with the three Baltic states as outliers (up to 19.3 percent in Estonia). The Netherlands are struggling with an inflation rate of 11.6 percent. In Germany, prices increased by 8.8 percent and in France by 5.8 percent.â€œInflation is exceptionally high in Belgium.â€ European Commission Government measures to mitigate the impact of high energy prices on families and businesses are creating a budget deficit of 5.2 percent this year (compared to 5.6 percent last year). â€œThe higher spending in the context of the automatic indexation of civil service wages and social benefits is only partly offset by the impact of higher wages and purchasing power,â€ the Commissionâ€™s report reads. In 2023, the deficit is expected to increase to 5.8 percent, making Belgium and Slovakia the countries with the largest deficits in the whole of Europe. (November 11)Hungary offers the prospect of judicial reform to access EU pandemic aid fundsBrussels (dpa) – After months of deadlock, negotiations between Hungary and the EU Commission on the plan over the disbursement of billions of euros in aid to counter the effects of the coronavirus pandemic are moving forward. The right-wing national government in Budapest has accepted the Commissionâ€™s conditions with regard to the independence of the judiciary, an EU official told the German Press Agency (dpa) in Brussels on November 11. According to the official, this had been a sticking point in the talks. Thus an important step had been taken, but the end of the negotiations had not been reached yet, the source said.According to the information, the conditions include the provision that key positions in the judiciary may only be filled with the involvement of the independent National Judicial Council. In addition, the governmentâ€™s right to challenge final court decisions before the politically elected constitutional court is to be abolished. Furthermore, the Supreme Court will no longer be able to intervene in the right of judges to appeal to the European Court of Justice. Should the EU Commission recommend to approve the Hungarian plan on the basis of the concessions, it would take several more months before Budapest receives money. The EU member states must first approve the plan. In addition, the promised reforms must be implemented satisfactorily before money flows, the EU official stressed. The aim is for this to happen by March 2023.The EU Commission has been criticizing political influence on the judiciary in Hungary for years, in addition to a high level of corruption and other violations of the rule of law. These points also play a role in the negotiations. Recently, the EU Parliament even attested that Hungary was no longer a fully-fledged democracy. The billions from the aid funds are not the only money Budapest is waiting for. In mid-September, the EU Commission had proposed freezing payments of around 7.5 billion euros due to widespread corruption, among other things. With regard to this, Hungary also made comprehensive promises of reform. (November 11)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Wednesdays and Fridays.

"Europe in brief: ECB warns of technical recession risk in the eurozone, EU Commission calls on Council of the EU to accept Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia into the Schengen area, EU to provide 1 billion euros for climate adaption in Africa","Amid high energy prices, rising inflation and low economic growth, risks to financial stability in the euro area have increased, warns the European Central Bank. What also happened: The European Commission calls for Schengen area membership for Romania, Bulgaria as well as Croatia and announces a 1-billion-euro program to help fund climate change adaptation and resilience in Africa. ECB warns of financial stability risks in euro areaFrankfurt/Main (dpa) – The European Central Bank (ECB) sees growing risks for financial stability in the euro area. â€œIn our estimation, risks to financial stability have increased and a technical recession in the euro area has become more likely,â€ said ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos at the presentation of the central bankâ€™s financial stability review in Frankfurt on Wednesday. If the economy shrinks year-on-year for two consecutive quarters, economists speak of a â€œtechnical recessionâ€.â€œI think that the main risk for financial stability and growth now is a very high inflation level,â€ de Guindos said. â€œAt present, our main contribution to financial stability is the establishment of price stability.â€ According to the ECB, this would be ensured at mid-term inflation levels of two percent in the euro area. Inflation has been a long way off that target for months: In the euro area, consumer prices increased by 10.7 percent year on year in October. In Europeâ€™s largest economy, Germany, the inflation rate rose to 10.4 percent in October.Since July, the ECB has been trying to get a grip on extremely high inflation rates with sharp interest rate hikes. The key interest rate in the euro area, which had been frozen at a record low of zero percent for years, now stands at 2.0 percent. The ongoing war in Ukraine continues to represent a significant inflation risk and threat to growth, the ECB noted. Overall, however, the central bank, which directly supervises the largest banks in the eurozone, considers the banking system in the currency area consisting of 19 countries to be â€œwell positioned to withstand many risks.â€ (November 16)EU Commission: Bulgaria and Romania have met the required conditions and should become full members of the Schengen areaBrussels/Sofia (BTA) – The European Commission (EC) calls upon the EU Council to take the necessary steps to grant Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia full membership in the Schengen area without further delay. In a communication adopted on November 16, the Commission took stock of the three member states' strong record of achievements in the application of the Schengen rules.â€œUntil now, we have not had such categorical support from the European institutions for Bulgaria's accession to Schengen,â€ said Bulgarian Acting Minister of Justice Krum Zarkov. Minister of Foreign Affairs Nikolay Milkov said Bulgaria was trying to secure the Netherlandsâ€™ support to achieve the required unanimity in the EU Council vote on 8 December.On Thursday, the Bulgarian National Assembly adopted a declaration expressing its full support for the efforts of the Bulgarian government to convince the EU Council to vote in favor of Bulgaria's Schengen membership by the end of 2022. MPs urge parliaments of EU member states to support Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area and thus uphold the principles of equality and non-discrimination. The Bulgarian Parliament calls on the Council of the EU to adopt a decision for the full implementation of the provisions of Schengen law in relation to Bulgaria, thereby guaranteeing the abolition of checks at all land, air and sea borders of the country with other member states by the beginning of 2023. (November 17)Climate Change: EU pledges over 1 billion euros for adaptation in AfricaOn August 8, 2022, a herd of sheep walk over cracked earth at al-Massira dam in Ouled Essi Masseoud village, some 140 kilometres south from Morocco's economic capital Casablanca, amidst the country's worst drought in at least four decades.

Some of this money would be directed to mitigate the losses and damages already suffered by the continent, Timmermans said.

EU military aid to Ukraine: Training mission and replenishment of weapons stockpiles,"This week, the EU has launched a training mission for Ukrainian soldiers. It is the largest EU military mission so far. At the defence ministersâ€™ meeting in Brussels, its outlines became clearer. When it comes to delivering weapons to Ukraine to replenish depleted stocks, the EU warns individual member states against going it alone.At the beginning of this week, the EU officially launched a training mission for Ukrainian troops called the European Union Assistance Mission Ukraine (EUMAM Ukraine). The general decision to install the training mission had already been taken by the foreign ministers on October 17. Hungary was the only country that did not vote in favor, but made use of the possibility of a constructive abstention, which means that the country is neither participating in nor financing the mission. Austria had already declared it would support the mission, but did not plan to be an active part of it.This is the largest military training mission the EU has ever launched. It aims to prepare an initial 15,000 Ukrainian troops for the battlefield. The mission is initially designed for two years and expected to cost around 60 million euros per annum. The money comes from the bloc's European Peace Facility, a fund that has already been severely strained, as it is also tapped to cover the cost of weapon deliveries by EU members toUkraine. The mission will be carried out by some twenty member states.Mission headquarters in Poland and GermanyThe main hub for the mission will be in Ukraine's neighboring country Poland, with secondary headquarters set up in Germany. Germany's Defence Minister Christine Lambrecht said at a meeting with EU counterparts in Brussels that Berlin was planning to train 5,000 Ukrainians ""in a wide range of skills"" by next June.Slovenia will participate in the EU mission to train Ukrainian troops with a few dozen instructors, who are expected to be deployed to Germany, Defence Ministry State Secretary Damir ÄŒrnÄec announced in Brussels on Tuesday. The instructors are to provide mostly specialist training, he said, noting that the proposal was yet to be confirmed by the government. The ministry is holding internal discussions as to in what way Slovenia could participate and which specialist skills of Slovenian army members could be useful. What kind of experts Slovenia will send also depends on the needs of the Ukrainian army, ÄŒrnÄec said. But he added that for the time being there were no plans for Ukrainian soldiers to be trained in Slovenia.Other countriesâ€™ participationSpainâ€™s Minister of Defence, Margarita Robles, announced at Tuesday's Council meeting that the country will be able to train 2,400 Ukrainian troops per year within the framework of this mission, although she recalled that Spain has already trained more than one hundred members of the Ukrainian armed forces individually in Zaragoza, AlmerÃ­a, Toledo and Madrid.""Spain has always been an ally that has been involved in all European Union missions, and we understand that this mission is important in order to help Ukraine,"" Robles said in Brussels.Belgian Minister of Defene Ludivine Dedonder announced that her country would make 50 to 100 soldiers available for the mission. The Belgian army is specialized in demining on land and at sea and is ready to share this knowhow. Last month the government already decided to invite Ukrainian soldiers to Belgium next year to learn how to operate new equipment to defuse explosives. But depending on the needs and requests of Kiev, Belgium would also be willing to provide other forms of training, such as combat training and fire support, communications and traumatology on the battlefield.Within the framework of EUMAM Ukraine, Bulgaria will train four units of a total of 60 Ukrainian military nurses and medical staff in Sofia. The country is hoping to be ready for a parliament decision on military equipment support as early as next week.At the foreign ministersâ€™ meeting on November 14, Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Bogdan Aurescu highlighted the need to continue EU support for Ukraine on all levels – political, financial, military and economic. He hailed the launch and rapid operationalization of EUMAM Ukraine and the adoption of assistance measures by the European Peace Facility. He also mentioned that Romania will continue to provide multidimensional support for Ukraine and recalled Romaniaâ€™s efforts to facilitate the export of grain and other Ukrainian products through Romanian sea ports.Unclear situation in CroatiaThe Croatian government wants to participate in the training mission for Ukrainian soldiers, but it is not certain that this will happen, because President Zoran MilanoviÄ‡, who has authority over the army, opposes the idea. As commander-in-chief of the armed forces, the president can block the government's decision. His opposition can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in parliament. After reiterating his opposition on November 15, MilanoviÄ‡ stated: ""Let Parliament discuss the matter, if two-thirds of MPs make a decision to that effect, I will accept it.""The Croatian government accuses MilanoviÄ‡ of having pro-Russian views, whereas he believes that by participating in EUMAM Ukraine, Croatia would become involved in the war. President MilanoviÄ‡ accuses the government and ministers of attempting to circumvent him in decision-making on foreign affairs and defence.After Tuesdayâ€™s meeting, Defence Minister Mario BanoÅ¾iÄ‡ was unable to say how exactly Croatia would be involved, ""I cannot comment on the mode until it passes coordinating bodies, primarily the government. The mode was proposed by the Croatian army, based on its experience in previous missions and operations."" Asked if Ukrainian soldiers would be trained in Croatia or some other EU member country if the decision was approved, BanoÅ¾iÄ‡ said that both modes had been proposed.Common weapon purchasesThe defence ministers also discussed the joint procurement of weapons. Croatian Minister BanoÅ¾iÄ‡ welcomed the previous results of a working group in terms of potential cooperation and joint procurement. Belgium is also in favor of joint procurement in the EU and has already purchased weapons together with its neighbors Luxembourg and the Netherlands. After the meeting, EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said that needs had been identified and the EU would now reach out to the industry.Before the meeting, Borrell warned that the continent could fall into a competitive race to replenish depleted stocks after already having provided so many arms to Ukraine this year.""The important is to go together, to avoid splitting the market, to avoid competition,"" Borrell said in Brussels. He said a situation like during the Covid-19 pandemic, when EU member states raced to buy vaccines for their own countries, should be avoided.""Everybody together, all together makes better prices, better quality and better time,"" he said.Brussels said that including deliveries by individual member states, the European Union had thus far provided arms and military equipment with a total value of eight billion euros to Ukraine. That's around 45 percent of the value of arms deliveries provided by the United States.This article is published Fridays. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1

For years, they oppressed different countries of the world, including #Afghanistan, #Iraq under various pretexts. I want ask Twitter to remove her blue checkmark (sic),â€ the post reads.Foster has served as the British ambassador to Somalia since February 2021.The same allegation about her was made in this tweet.But the claim is false.Not FosterA reverse image search found the photo on the website of the Centre for Historical Research and Documentation on War and Contemporary Society (Cegesoma) in Belgium.The photo is part of an archived collection, titled: â€œCollection Monsieur Van de Meerssche: Congo Belge, [1950-1960].â€Image on the Cegesomaâ€™s archivesCongo Belge means Belgian Congo which refers to a former African country ruled by Belgium from 1908 to 1960 â€” the modern-day Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).The photograph was also used as a 2020 book cover by historian Paul Van Damme.The bookâ€™s title written in Dutch translates to: â€œWhite-Black in Black and White. Together and yet apart: Pictures and Stories from The Belgian Congo.â€Screenshot of the book coverAccording to information on the Cagesoma website, the photograph was taken sometime in the decade before 1960. This makes it unlikely for Foster to be the young girl on the left; there is no evidence to show that she lived in DRC or that she had been born at the time.Fosterâ€™s official LinkedIn account shows that she joined university in 1996 â€” this is at least 36 years after the photo was archived. She was first employed in 1999.The United Kingdom Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office also confirmed to AFP Fact Check that â€œFoster is not among the girls in the photo as the posts suggestâ€.AFP Fact Check is still verifying the identity of the two girls in the photo.Under Belgian rule, the Congolese suffered greatly before gaining independence in 1960.

"Europe in brief: EU “disappointed” by COP27, UK denies looking for closer ties with EU, EU calls for emergency meeting between Serbia and Kosovo, and Croatia is worried about Austria’s position on its Schengen access
","The EUâ€™s Vice-President Frans Timmermans has shown disappointment about the results of the COP27 in Sharm el Sheikh. The British government denies reports about seeking closer ties with Brussels. The EUâ€™s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has called an emergency meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Albin Kurti, Prime Minister of Kosovo, over the license plate crisis, and Croatia is worried that Austria wonâ€™t agree to its Schengen access. The EU â€œdisappointedâ€ by the climate agreement at COP27Sharm el Sheikh (Egypt) (EFE) – Executive Vice President of the European Commission Frans Timmermans said, â€œwe are disappointedâ€ about the failure to agree on â€œstrong languageâ€ on the issue of climate change mitigation (reduction of polluting emissions) in the final text of the COP27 climate summit.The Sharm El Sheikh Implementation Plan, approved this Sunday, urges countries to progressively reduce energy generation from coal – in plants that do not have carbon capture technologies – and to gradually abandon inefficient subsidies on fossil fuels. These requests were already included in the final Glasgow text (COP26). For Timmermans, this plan â€œis not enough of a step forward for people and planet.â€â€œWe wasted a lot of time already. And our people and planet have no more time to lose. We pledge to pick up speed again, starting now and here. And regain the momentum we had in Glasgow,â€ said Timmermans, who is responsible for the European Green Deal in the Commission. The main result that has come out of Sharm el Sheikh: a fund to finance losses and damages in developing countries that are â€œparticularly vulnerableâ€ to the effects of climate change – a historic demand of these nations, which are threatened by global warming to which they have made little contribution themselves. The proposal, which still has many details to be outlined, supports the so called â€œmosaic solutionâ€ demanded by the EU negotiating bloc. Together with other countries, they advocated the use of new financial instruments, including private funding, to help cover damages after extreme events related to the climate crisis, in addition to creating a new fund within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). (November 20)United Kingdom: Government denies seeking to strengthen ties with the EULondon (AFP) – On Sunday, the British government denied press reports that London was seeking closer ties with Brussels, three years after leaving the European Union.According to the Sunday Times, â€œsenior government figures are planning to put Britain on the path towards a Swiss-style relationship with the European Union.â€An initiative that would be â€œintended to forge closer economic tiesâ€ with the European Union, according to the newspaper.However, a government spokesman quoted by the British news agency PA called the article â€œcategorically untrue.â€""This government is focused on using our Brexit freedoms to create opportunities that drive growth and strengthen our economy,"" the source added.""Brexit means we will never again have to accept a relationship with Europe that would see a return to freedom of movement, unnecessary payments to the European Union or jeopardise the full benefit of trade deals we are now able to strike around the world,"" clarified the spokesperson. (November 20)Borrell calls an emergency meeting with leaders of Serbia and Kosovo over license plate crisisBrussels (ANSA) – The EU High Representative for Foreign Policy, Josep Borrell, has called an emergency meeting with Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Kosovoâ€™s Prime Minister Albin Kurti. The head of European diplomacy, assisted by the special envoy for the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak, will hold bilateral talks with the two leaders before a joint face-to-face meeting.The objective of the meeting is to reach an agreement that will avert a new escalation of the so-called license plate crisis, which worsened at the beginning of the month with the mass resignation of ethnic Serb Kosovars from the countryâ€™s institutions. â€œWe need de-escalation of the situation, stop going from permanent crisis management & start advancing on normalisation of relations [between Kosovo and Serbia] instead,â€ Borrell wrote in a tweet ahead of the meeting.The bone of contention is the Pristina legislation that introduces the obligation to re-register cars carrying Serbian license plates and to replace these plates with Kosovan ones. The legislation provides for a roadmap for its implementation, which came into force on November 1. So far, car owners who did not comply have received verbal warnings. However, starting on November 21, a fine of 150 euros will be imposed.Serbians oppose the plan and ask for compliance with the Brussels accords by Kosovan authorities, particularly with regard to the establishment of an association of Serb-majority municipalities. Kosovo's government, on the other hand, insists on the concept of reciprocity and stresses that the creation of a single-ethnic entity goes against constitutional legislation. (November 20)Austrian ministerâ€™s Schengen opposition worries Croatia, Nehammer in Zagreb on WednesdayVienna (HINA) – On Saturday, the office of Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Peopleâ€™s Party of Austria/Ã–VP) declined to comment on a statement by Interior Minister Gerhard Karner (Ã–VP), in which he opposed the expansion of the Schengen area to include Croatia, Romania and Bulgaria.â€œAn extension of a system that in itself does not work is doomed to fail. That is why, from the present perspective, my position as the Minister of the Interior responsible for security, is a clear â€˜noâ€™,â€ Karner told Austrian public broadcaster ORF with regard to the extension of Schengen. This statement was referred to by the Austrian Interior Ministry on its website.Minister Karner explained that of the 100,000 illegal migrants recorded in Austria this year, 75,000 passed through one of the European Union countries without being registered by the authorities of those countries.The ministry said Karner had fought for a meeting of EU interior ministers next week, where migration in the Western Balkans will be the main topic. Another meeting on the same topic should be held in early December.Karner once again defended keeping border controls with Slovenia and Hungary and said that many EU countries had been carrying out such controls for a long time. HINAâ€™s request to the Austrian Interior Ministry to comment on Minister Karnerâ€™s statement has remained unanswered so far.On Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is scheduled to arrive for a working visit to Croatia. This will be an occasion to clarify Austriaâ€™s position regarding Croatiaâ€™s accession to Schengen. Nehammerâ€™s office declined to comment on Karnerâ€™s statement. The final decision on the enlargement of the Schengen area will be taken by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, which will meet in Brussels on 8 and 9 December. The Czech Presidency prepared two draft decisions, one for Croatia and one for Bulgaria and Romania. (November 19)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Migration crisis at Europe's doorstep,"Amid the French-Italian controversy over migrants, Brussels wants to combat illegal migration in the Central Mediterranean with a new action plan. However, the greater challenge is bound to be what is probably the most active migratory route in Europe â€“ the Western Balkans.A humanitarian vessel carrying 234 migrants, including 57 children, hovered for nearly three weeks in international waters. Eventually, the Ocean Viking, a ship sailing under the Norwegian flag and operated by French NGO SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e, was redirected to Toulon in France after Rome refused access to Italian ports. The incident caused a diplomatic spat between Italy and France.""We have to keep in mind that a clear majority of the people arriving via this central Mediterranean route today do not need international protection,"" said Ylva Johansson, EU Commissioner for Home Affairs. Many of these migrants mainly came from Egypt, Tunisia and Bangladesh and wanted to find a paying job in the EU, she added.The bloc has struggled for years to agree on how to share out arriving migrants and asylum seekers. Ahead of the Extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council of November 25, 2022, the European Commission presented an Action Plan on the Central Mediterranean, proposing a series of measures to address the ongoing challenges along the route. This action plan aims to curb illegal migration across the Mediterranean Sea and to strengthen the solidarity and responsibility of the Member States. Cooperation with countries of origin and transit is to be intensified, irregular and unsafe migration is to be discouraged, and solutions in the area of search and rescue are to be offered. The Commission announced that similar action plans will be developed for migration routes across the Eastern Mediterranean and the Western Balkans.According to Commissioner Johansson, the action plan also seeks to accelerate the implementation of the solidarity mechanism, which was agreed upon by 19 EU member states in June of this year. Under this agreement, member states are to take in 8,000 refugees rescued on beaches or off the Mediterranean coasts of the southern EU member states by the end of June 2023.But the dispute between France and Italy has already threatened the agreement. The new right-wing government in Rome would prefer not to allow private rescue ships carrying migrants to enter Italian ports at all. In retaliation, Paris said it would no longer take in 3,500 migrants from Italy and urged other EU countries to suspend their participation in the EUâ€™s migrant relocation mechanism and adopt similar measures. Rome stated that some NGO ships were violating international law. Meanwhile, on November 18, France denied entry into the country to 123 out of the 234 migrants of the Ocean Viking. On November 25, EU interior ministers will also hold crisis talks to head off this controversy.The issue of refugee distributionIn a joint statement, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta criticized other member states for not doing enough to share the burden of asylum seekers. They said only a small proportion of the migrants arriving in the four countries were being relocated under the current European system. According to the commission, only 117 migrants out of the 8,000 have been redistributed under the voluntary solidarity mechanism so far.  Italy's interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi, said that for his country the solidarity mechanism had delivered ""absolutely insufficient results."" He added that other states were not prepared to take on responsibility when ships with nearly 1,000 rescued migrants on board waited for days off the Italian coast for a port to be assigned. He cautiously welcomed the EU plan and stressed the importance of reviving the migrant distribution plan agreed upon in June.European Commission spokeswoman Anitta Hipper stated that there was a ""clear, unequivocal obligation"" to rescue people in danger at sea and no difference should be made between NGO ships and other vessels.For Spain, the European Mediterranean countries have already demonstrated their flexibility when it comes to the implementation of effective procedures to help tackle irregular migration, improve returns and ensure better asylum system support. With regard to the voluntary solidarity mechanism, Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said that the system should be predictable, so that each country would be able to anticipate the obligations it had to meet. According to Spain, the only way to effectively manage migration flows in the long run is close cooperation between the countries of origin, transit and destination.Germany and Belgium record high numbers of arrivalsGerman Ambassador to Rome Viktor Elbling commented in a Tweet on November 11: â€œItaly does a lot in terms of migration but it is not alone: 154,385 asylum seekers in Germany in the period Jan-Sep 2022, 110,055 in France, 48,935 in Italy. They are respectively 0.186 percent of the German population, 0.163 percent of the French population and 0.083 percent of the Italian population.â€https://twitter.com/Ambtedesco/status/1591036559578771456So far this year, the German Federal Police has detected 75,934 unauthorized entries into Germany. In September, there were 12,700 unauthorized entries, and 13,400 in October. The last time Germany recorded five-digit monthly figures was during the migrant crisis in February 2016.Meanwhile, Belgium has recently received more than 4,000 asylum applications per month and is having trouble finding enough accommodation for asylum seekers. For years, Belgium has been advocating a common European approach and is in favor of the EUâ€™s migrant relocation mechanism, but on the condition that asylum seekers are actually registered in the country of arrival and that secondary movements are prevented.The Belgian Secretary of State Nicole de Moor traveled to Congo last week and plans to visit Egypt. ""We do this on a bilateral basis and it's having an effect, but we get better results if the EU as a whole puts its collective weight in."" She particularly appreciated the emphasis the new action plan puts on cooperation with countries of origin and transit, as well as the discouragement of people who try to reach Europe but are unlikely to be accepted as asylum seekers.A new crisis is brewing along the Western Balkan RouteMigrants walking towards Camp Lipa in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Photo: Kemal Softic/AP/dpaIn recent months, there has been a significant increase in the arrival of irregular migrants via the Western Balkan route, and ""a large number of them come via Serbia, because they enter that country without visas and then proceed to the member states of the Union,"" said Commissioner Johansson on November 18.In response to pressure from EU countries, Serbia has aligned its visa policies with those of the EU for some countries in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. The visa-free entry agreements with Tunisia and Burundi expired in November. Serbia will soon introduce visas with two more countries, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ announced, but he did not specify which. Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said during his visit to Belgrade on November 16: ""Thank you the President of Serbia for advocating the end of this asylum tourism caused by visa liberalization for citizens of India, Tunisia and other countries. We had a large number of asylum seekers from India, VuÄiÄ‡ reacted and did not leave Austria in the lurch.""On November 16, Serbia, Hungary and Austria signed a memorandum on strengthening cooperation on migration and border protection, under which police officers of the three countries will work together.Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Croatia and Slovenia have become transit countries for migrants heading towards Western Europe. In BiH, there are currently about 2,600 migrants registered in reception centers, while about another 700 migrants mainly reside close to the EU border. Citizens of Burundi are among the three most numerous groups of arrivals, which is a direct consequence of the visa-free regime that the country had with BiH's neighbor Serbia.The authorities in BiH have identified the high-risk countries with which readmission agreements should be signed, but these countries are delaying the process. So far, there is an agreement only with Pakistan. BiH is responding much better to migration than in previous years, but even today the number of policemen protecting the stateâ€™s borders is still considered insufficient.Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria – external border management in the Schengen areaCroatia recorded a sharp increase of 146 percent in illegal crossings, according to Å½arko Katic, State Secretary in the Croatian Ministry of the Interior. And the countries of origin of the migrants flowing into Croatia have also changed. Traditionally, migrants entering Croatia came from the Middle East and North and Sub-Saharan Africa. This year, the top five countries of origin are Iraq, Burundi, Turkey, Afghanistan and Cuba.Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner caused concern in Croatia recently, saying he would oppose the extension of the Schengen area to Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. Austria was experiencing enormous migrant pressure, he added. This year, Austria has recorded around 100,000 migrants, of whom 75,000 were not previously registered in any of the other EU member states. However, in Zagreb on Wednesday, Austrian Chancellor Nehammer said that Austria would support Croatiaâ€™s bid to join the Schengen area.Croatia's northwestern neighbor Slovenia also experienced a significant year-on-year increase of 160 percent to 21,467 illegal border crossings in the first 10 months of 2022. And most of these migrants came from countries like Burundi, India, Cuba, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. However, after Serbia aligned its visa policy with the EU, the number of Burundian and Tunisian migrants had already decreased, the Slovenian Ministry of the Interior said. Applications for international protection in Slovenia also multiplied to 21,452 in the first 10 months of the current year, up from just 4,174 for the same period of 2021. According to the latest data, only 167 applications for international protection were approved so far this year.Even though Slovenia supports Croatiaâ€™s accession to the Schengen area, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said that the country would introduce border controls with Croatia if necessary. She said that Slovenia didnâ€™t want to become a pocket for illegal migration.Meanwhile, Schengen candidate Bulgaria has recorded an increasing number of migrants trying to illegally cross the EU external border from Turkey since the summer of 2022. In recent weeks, there have been daily accidents caused by smugglers and migrants. In September, a state of emergency was declared for the first time in three southern regions of Bulgaria due to increased migration pressure. Meanwhile, Europol has discussed the formation of joint border intervention teams with Sofia.This article is published Fridays. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1

Albania has become a member with full rights in the European Civil Protection Mechanism. Brussels proposes a cap of 275 euros on the price of gas purchasesBrussels/Madrid/CastellÃ³n (Europa Press) – The European Commission has proposed putting a cap of 275 euros per megawatt hour (MWh) on the price of gas purchases. The mechanism would be activated automatically in the event of exceptional price rises and would limit transactions on the regulated market, although it might be suspended in the event of serious disruptions to the markets.The proposal still needs to be negotiated by the Member States of the European Union, but it has already been rejected by several of them, including Spain, France and Poland, who regard the suggested price limit as too high. On the other hand, the Netherlands and Germany criticize the proposal for opposite reasons, since they do not see the need to intervene in the market. For the President of the Spanish Government, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, the Brussels proposal is ""clearly insufficient."" Spain will demand a price cap that is dynamic, takes international markets as a reference and includes a plus that must jointly be set by the 27 Member States, said Minister for Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera. (November 23, 23 and 24)Slovakian Minister of Foreign Affairs: Aggression against Ukraine threatens the system of human rights protectionBanskÃ¡ Bystrica (TASR) – Russian aggression against Ukraine threatens the system of human rights protection and the entire international order based on the rule of law. This was stated on November 21 by Slovakian Minister of Foreign Affairs Rastislav KÃ¡Äer, when he opened the 9th Annual Human Forum and the 2nd Annual Conference of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in BanskÃ¡ Bystrica. The motto of this yearâ€™s Human Forum, an international discussion forum on human rights, was Democracy in danger? Until November 23, the participants discussed the global and regional challenges for democracy and human rights, especially in times of armed aggression in Slovakiaâ€™s neighborhood, as well as the role of civil society in protecting human rights in Slovakia.According to the organizers of the forum, the geopolitical situation in the world changed after the aggressive attack of the Russian Federation on the independent state of Ukraine. Recognizing democratic values â€‹â€‹and principles is currently proven to be key to future progress. ""The main goal is to have an intensive debate between citizens, political representatives, representatives of international institutions, academics and the private business sector, so that with joint efforts, democracy can be strengthened and reduce social extremism again,"" the organizers said.According to KÃ¡Äer, the answer to those questioning the international order should be a clear value-based foreign policy. ""However, the whole of society must be aware of the importance of democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms,"" declared the head of Slovak diplomacy. KÃ¡Äer also emphasized that there must not be indifference to the aggressive behavior of authoritarian and dictatorial regimes or extremist forces or movements, because this could cost society dearly.

"Europe in brief: France keeps tough stance on migration, French President Macron to ask US to exempt EU manufacturers, Spain and EU propose removal of the â€œfence of Gibraltarâ€","At an emergency meeting about increasing migration figures, opinions of the Member States on the situation differed. On his upcoming trip to the US, French President Emmanuel Macron wants to ask for exemptions for European manufacturers penalized by US law. Spain and the EU propose to the UK to eliminate â€œthe fenceâ€ between Spain and the British territory Gibraltar.  France remains tough in the dispute over refugeesBrussels (dpa) â€” In the European dispute over the admission of boat refugees, France is sticking to its tough course against the new right-wing government in Rome. After an EU crisis meeting in Brussels on November 25, French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin reaffirmed that his country is only going to accept refugees from Italy again, when Rome ensures that rescue ships from aid organizations will no longer travel to France. â€œWe need to get out of a situation in which the same states are called upon to receive ships and take on relocations from other member states,â€ Darmanin explained.The minister was referring to the fact that Italy had recently denied the rescue ship â€œOcean Vikingâ€ entry into a port, whereupon the ship had to sail to France with more than 200 migrants on board. The government in Paris was outraged by this and pointed out that rescue ships actually had a right to go to the nearest port. Italy, on the other hand, criticizes the lack of solidarity among other EU states when taking in refugees and has called for more support. In addition, crews of rescue ships are accused of promoting the business of human trafficking in the Mediterranean.The current Czech Presidency of the Council of the EU considered the crisis meeting in Brussels a success, despite the differences of opinion among the EU states. According to Interior Minister Vit Rakusan, a new action plan from the EU Commission was welcomed. In particular, it provides for intensified cooperation with countries of origin and transit and launches a new program against human trafficking in North Africa. This could enable a special framework and guidelines from the International Maritime Organization for private sea rescue ships, which repeatedly bring hundreds of migrants to European ports. In addition, the solidarity mechanism, which was launched in June and is voluntarily supported by around 20 EU countries, should be put to better use.According to the Interior Ministry in Rome, more than 94,000 migrants have arrived in Italy since the beginning of the year. Compared to the same period of the previous year, the figure increased by around 53 percent. The responsible EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson had recently described the situation as unsustainable and pointed out that only few arrivals leave their countries of origin due to political persecution.On November 24, German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said in the Bundestag that Germany currently has â€œno major migration crisis.â€ In the past, the German Government had also repeatedly pointed out to Brussels that, as a rule, significantly more asylum applications are filed in Germany every month than in Italy. According to the EU statistics office Eurostat on November 25, almost 17,000 applicants were registered in Germany in August alone, compared to around 6,000 in Italy.Specific political decisions on how to deal with the new increase in migration figures are expected at the next regular meeting of interior ministers on December 8 at the earliest. By then, the EU Commission also wants to present an action plan on the increasing numbers of people coming to the EU via the countries of the Western Balkans. (November 25)Macron hopes to get exemptions from Biden for European manufacturers penalized by American lawParis (AFP) – As the French presidency announced on Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron, who will be on a state visit to Washington next week, intends to obtain exemptions from his American counterpart Joe Biden for European manufacturers penalized by US legislation.The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which came into effect last August, aims to reduce costs for the USA. It includes not only massive investments in the energy sector and in favor of the climate, but also generous subsidies for electric vehicles, batteries and renewable energy projects.However, many subsidies will only be paid for products manufactured in the United States, which will, for example, favor American Teslas over German electric BMWs, and American steel for wind farm projects.Emmanuel Macron will arrive in Washington on November 29 in the evening and commence his official visit the following day. (November 25)Spain and the EU propose to UK to remove the â€œfence of Gibraltarâ€Madrid (EFE) – The Spanish Government and the European Commission have submitted to the United Kingdom a proposal for the Spanish region Campo de Gibraltar – the southernmost part of mainland Europe, which borders the British overseas territory of Gibraltar – to become a â€œzone of shared prosperity.â€ This includes the removal of the border post known as â€œfence of Gibraltarâ€ in order to promote the mobility of people and goods between the British colony and the European Union (EU).Spainâ€™s Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares announced the proposal on November 25 after a meeting in Madrid with the main local and regional authorities with jurisdiction in the area, during which he explained the scope of negotiations between Spain and the Commission on Gibraltar. The talks are at a very advanced stage, which Albares described as positive.The Spanish proposal includes the protection and improvement of the rights of workers and beneficiaries of social benefits in Gibraltar while guaranteeing, with regard to customs, the freedom of movement of goods â€œwithout increasing risks for the EUâ€™s internal marketâ€, in particular in the area of unfair competition or illicit trafficking, such as tobacco. This implies for Spain to exercise, on behalf of the EU, functions of control and protection of the internal market, as customs controls between Spain and Gibraltar will be abolished.

Hungary: EU Commission wants to withhold EU funding,"In an unprecedented move, the EU Commission has proposed freezing the 65 percent of the EU cohesion funds for Hungary, namely 7.5 billion euro, over concerns about rule of law. On the other side, European Commission officials conditionally approved Budapestâ€™s 5.8-billion-euro recovery plan. Now, it will up to the EU member states to decide on both issues that could come with high political stakes.On November 30, the European Commission recommended to the EU Council that 7,5 billion euros of EU cohesion funds for Hungary should be frozen until the country has implemented substantial reforms to guarantee the rule of law. The EU Commission also approved Hungaryâ€™s recovery plan under conditions.Efforts by Budapest in recent months to tackle corruption and improve the rule of law with the aim of appeasing Brussels were not sufficient to unblock the money, the commission declared in a statement.""The direction is still the right one, but we are not yet at the goal,"" EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn said at a press conference.The commission has long criticized widespread corruption in Hungary, as have other EU bodies like the European Parliament, but this is the first time it has threatened to cut funding.17 measures to safeguard the EU budgetThe official process of restricting funding began in April 2022, using new legislation implemented in 2021 - the so-called rule of law conditionality mechanism - aimed at ensuring that EU countries adhere to the bloc's general principles as well as safeguarding the EUâ€™s budget.In September of this year, the commission announced its recommendation to freeze funding for Hungary while leaving the door open to retract in case 17 remedial measures were implemented by November 19 according to a plan agreed with Hungarian authorities.â€œWhile a number of reforms have been undertaken or are underway, Hungary failed to adequately implement central aspects of the necessary 17 remedial measures,â€ the commission said in a press release.The commission concluded that substantial steps were still needed to eliminate remaining risks to the EU budget in Hungary. There were, in particular, concerns that EU funds are not being used for their intended purpose due to corruption. The sums at stake are some 7.5 billion euros of the EU budget.A fundamental principle for putting the law into effect is whether the commission believes EU funds are being misused.27 milestones to hit for Covid recovery fundsThe commission approved Budapest's plan on how to spend the 5.8 billion euros in Covid-19 aid but stressed that no funds should be released to Hungary until all demanded reforms are fully implemented.""The 'essential milestones' must all be met in full before Hungary can submit its payment request,"" Executive Vice-President of the commission Valdis Dombrovskis said during a news conference.""If they are not met, the entire payment would be blocked, and all subsequent ones too. In short: no funds will flow until the 'essential milestones' are properly implemented.""There are 27 milestones for reform that Hungary must fulfill. Those include the measures already agreed with Budapest under the rule of law conditionality mechanism, as well as a new set of measures aimed at strengthening judicial independence.The commission has taken a similar approach in the case of Poland, whose plan was adopted in the middle of the year.Bulgaria is also adopting rule-of-law reforms, as part of the wider reforms wanted by the commission for the disbursement of the Covid recovery funds. The country will adopt new legislation to enhance the accountability of its Prosecutor General. The reforms are being prepared in coordination with the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe and are expected to be passed by June 2023.Hungary is not surprisedThe commissionâ€™s decision on Budapest's Covid recovery plan ""did not come as a big surprise,"" ZoltÃ¡n KovÃ¡cs, a spokesperson for the Hungarian government, wrote on Twitter quoting Tibor Navracsics, the country's minister for regional development.""Hungary will deliver on the remaining commitments as accurately and thoroughly as it has done so far,"" he added.At the beginning of the week, Hungarian Minister Navracsics said he hoped the funds would be disbursed next year despite a recommendation by the commission to freeze funding.Member States need to decideThe commissionâ€™s proposal still needs backing from enough EU countries. 15 of the 27 EU states, which together must make up at least 65 percent of the total population of the EU - a so-called qualified majority, need to approve withholding the funds of the EU budget. The EU countries have until December 19 to reach a decision on the commissionâ€™s proposal. Furthermore, if the EU Council does not approve the recovery plan by the end of the year, Hungary will lose 70 percent of the EU recovery funds. In their first reactions governments took a cautious approach.The Slovenian Foreign Ministry told STA on November 30 that ""the government wants to carefully examine the proposal and make a considered decision."" The ministry added, ""in any case, a decision will be made in due time, before the EU Council decision.""Austriaâ€™s minister in charge of EU Affairs, Karoline Edtstadler, told APA on November 30 that she still wants to take a close look at the commission's assessment and talk to her Hungarian counterpart, while fully trusting the commission.""The rule of law is the backbone of European democracy,"" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on the sidelines of a NATO foreign ministers meeting in Bucharest, adding that rule of law was also the basis for the bloc's single market.Â Four member states could block the suspensionFour member countries representing more than 35 percent of the European population have veto power. In this regard, the position of Italy could become decisive.â€œFreezing funds would be a barbarity. On the rule of law the European Commission is politically orientedâ€ the EU parliamentarian Nicola Procaccini and member of the far-right-governing party â€œBrothers of Italyâ€ said in an interview to the Italian newspaper Domani. â€œSooner or later they will use this argument against Italy too,â€ he warned.Last week Italyâ€™s government coalition was split in a vote about Hungary in the EU Parliament. Italian Prime Minister GiorgiaMeloni's â€œBrothers of Italyâ€ party and Deputy Premier Matteo Salvini's right-wing League party voted against a resolution calling on the European Commission and Council to resist pressure from Hungary and go ahead with the measures. The delegation from ex-premier Silvio Berlusconi's conservative Forza Italia voted in favour, as did the parliamentarian majority.High political stakesFurther developments are eagerly awaited, especially because Hungary has considerable means at its disposal to exert pressure on the EU. EU officials have indicated they were aware of the risk that Hungary might continue with blocking tactics on EU decisions requiring member state unanimity, a form of ""blackmail"" to try to ease the pressure from Brussels.Budapest has already been standing in the way of efforts to extend sanctions on Moscow -- with which it has good ties and is highly dependent on Russian energy -- over Russia's war in Ukraine.It is also holding up EU adoption on a 15 percent corporate tax rate drawn up in the OECD.Hungary denies that its obstructionism is linked to the tussle over rule of law. In this regard the Austrian minister said, â€œHungary has shown itself to be quite cooperative in this ongoing procedure."" It is now up to the Czech EU presidency to come up with a proposal, she said. ""There will certainly still be a lot of need for discussion,"" Edtstadler added.The Hungarian government has, however, blamed earlierthe dispute with Brussels for the fact that the country has yet to ratify the NATO membership of Finland and Sweden. The process is dragging on ""because the parliament's agenda is full of draft laws proposed by the European Commission,"" Navracsics said.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Eurozone inflation rate eases to 10 percent, EU aims for visa-free travel for Kosovo from 2024 onwards, European Commission recommends Bosnia and Herzegovina be granted EU candidate status","According to Eurostat, inflation in the eurozone fell slightly in November from its record level in October. EU member states want Kosovo citizens to be exempt from visa requirements when travelling to the EU by 1 January 2024 at the latest. The European Union Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ© VÃ¡rhelyi visited BiH at a crucial moment for its path towards EU membership. Eurozone inflation eases to 10 percent in NovemberMadrid/Brussels (Europa Press) - The eurozone's year-on-year inflation rate stood at 10 percent in November, down six tenths of a percentage point from the all-time high recorded in October. It is the first slowdown in 17 months, according to Eurostat. Spain is the eurozone country where prices rose least sharply, at 6.6 percent.The Spanish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation highlighted that inflation in the country was almost 3.5 percentage points below the eurozone average in November, with the consequent further improvement in competitiveness for companies and the Spanish economy. For her part, the president of the European Central Bank (ECB), Christine Lagarde, assured that the institution will raise interest rates as much as necessary to achieve stability and reach the ""right stage"", after inflation in October accelerated to 10.6 percent, a level that Lagarde does not yet consider a ceiling for rising prices. (November 28/30)EU aims for visa-free travel for Kosovo from 2024 at the latestBrussels (APA) - EU member states want citizens of Kosovo to be exempt from visa requirements when travelling to the European Union by 1 January 2024 at the latest. After a six-year delay, the EU Council decided on November 30 that negotiations on visa-free travel can begin. The EU Commission had first proposed a visa waiver scheme for Kosovo back in 2016.On the basis of the negotiating mandate, the Czech EU Council Presidency wants to start talks with the European Parliament. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky spoke of an important step towards implementing the promise of visa liberalisation for Kosovo. ""Visa liberalisation has been made possible by Kosovo's efforts to strengthen its border controls, migration management and security, and we trust that this good cooperation will only be strengthened in the future,"" Lipavsky said.Kosovan passport holders could thus travel to the EU without a visa for a period of three months. One of the conditions for this was Kosovo's accession to the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS), which is due to come into force in November 2023. (November 30)European Commission recommends Bosnia and Herzegovina be granted EU candidate statusSarajevo (FENA) – The European Union Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi has paid an official two-day visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), following the European Commissionâ€™s decision to recommend the granting of candidate status to BiH. Commissioner VÃ¡rhelyi met with the new members of the Presidency of BiH Å½eljka CvijanoviÄ‡, Denis BeÄ‡iroviÄ‡ and Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡ and other officials in BiH, where he discussed the next steps and necessary reforms on BiH's path towards EU membership.""The recommendation is to grant BiH candidate status without delay, but it comes with high expectations. The EU path for BiH is open, but results are expected from BiH, which should be achieved without further delays, and it is up to the political leadership to make it a reality,"" said VÃ¡rhelyi.He noted that it is crucial for BiH to provide tangible and clear results, which will need to be presented to the Council of the European Union. In order for this to happen, he added, the outgoing Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina is expected to fulfil everything related to the adoption of key laws, and the newly elected Presidency of BiH is expected to have the 14 priorities of the European Commission as the backbone of their future work.At the meetings with VÃ¡rhelyi, BiH officials expressed the expectation that the European Council will confirm the granting of candidate status in mid-December, adding that such a decision would relax relations within BiH and direct the focus of all political actors to the path towards EU membership and the necessary reforms.

Posts falsely claim Qatar banned German football team from landing because of plane's pro-diversity logo,"Facebook posts shared thousands of times in Africa claim that a Lufthansa plane carrying the German football team to Qatar for the 2022 World Cup tournament was banned from landing because of its â€œgay logoâ€. But the claim is false: the players flew to Oman on the so-called ""Diversity"" plane for a friendly match, before switching to a smaller aircraft without any branding to head to Qatar. AFP Fact Check also found that â€œDiversityâ€ landed in Doha on at least three occasions in November 2022.On November 20, 2022 - the day the FIFA World Cup 2022 kicked off in Qatar, a Facebook post shared two images: one showing a Lufthansa plane purportedly branded with â€œgay picturesâ€ and another of an aircraft with an indistinct name.â€œQatar refused to permit plane carrying German players to land because of gay pictures around the plane. The Germans had to return and change their Airbus. I think African countries have to learn a lot from Qatari when it comes to respecting our culture (sic),â€ reads the post published on November 20, 2022.It was shared by a Facebook page called â€œInside Africaâ€ with more than 300,000 followers.The pageâ€™s administrators are based in Kenya, South Africa and Egypt, according to Facebookâ€™s transparency section.A screenshot of the false Facebook post, taken on November 24, 2022Similar posts were published on Facebook accounts in Nigeria and Zambia – seemingly in support of Qatar for banning the plane with a â€œgay logoâ€.â€œQatar is the pride of the Arabs,â€ one post says.The treatment of the LGBTQ community people has been of serious concern since footballâ€™s governing body FIFA announced the 2022 World Cup would be hosted by Qatar, a conservative nation that criminalises homosexuality and sex outside marriage.The claim has also been shared in French-speaking countries in Africa (see here and here).The â€Fanhansaâ€ livery on the German plane in question features an illustration of people from different ethnic backgrounds standing shoulder-to-shoulder beneath the words â€œDiversity Wins.â€According to German airline Lufthansa, the mural is a symbol of inclusion â€œregardless of gender, age, ethnicity, religion, nationality, identity or sexual orientationâ€.However, the â€œdiversityâ€ plane, as it has been referred to, was neither denied entry nor were German players forced to use another plane to fly to Qatar.Flight pathThe team left Germany aboard the â€œDiversityâ€ Airbus A330-343, serial number D-AIKQ, on November 14, 2022, and landed in Oman's capital Muscat for a friendly match before continuing on to Qatar.Lufthansa spokesman Martin Leutke shared a video of the departing plane on Twitter.Team Germany is on its wayâ€¦ âš½ï¸ðŸ† @DFB_Team @lufthansaNews pic.twitter.com/50fbH6PXyh— Martin Leutke (@mleutke) November 14, 2022 A photographer for Getty Images took a picture of the football players before they boarded.( Nina LAMPARSKI)AFP Fact Check traced the flight path of the plane on FlightAware, a website which maps global air traffic.A screenshot of FlightAware showing the â€œdiversityâ€ planeâ€™s route from Frankfurt to MuscatAccording to the flight data, the plane flew from Frankfurt to Muscat on November 14, 2022, before returning to Dubai and then Frankfurt the next day.A screenshot of FlightAware showing the â€œdiversityâ€ planeâ€™s route from Muscat to DubaiA screenshot of FlightAware showing the â€œdiversityâ€ planeâ€™s route from Dubai to FrankfurtLufthansa confirmed the flight details to AFP Fact Check on November 21, 2022, adding that the team travelled to Qatar from Oman on a small local plane without any branding.According to Lufthansa, the choice of a smaller plane was for ecological purposes as it was less polluting and sufficient to transport the team and staff.Days earlier, on November 11, 2022, the German Football Federation also explained in a statement that â€œan en-route flight with Lufthansa would mean empty flights from Germany to Muscat and back from Doha. DFB and Lufthansa have jointly decided in advance on this variant of the journey.â€While the German players did not fly into Qatar on the â€œDiversityâ€ plane, the aircraft has landed in the Muslim country on other occasions.A search on FlightRadar, another website monitoring flight traffic, revealed that the plane touched down in Doha on November 16, 18 and 19, 2022, with no restrictions.Screenshot from the FlightRadar24 website showing the â€œdiversityâ€ plane landing in Doha, taken on November 22, 2022Lufthansa also confirmed that passengers flew into Qatar onboard the companyâ€™s specially-branded plane in November 2022.LGBTQ rights furoreQatar has come under scrutiny over its human rights record, including its treatment of foreign workers and its stance on women's and LGBTQ rights.Days before the tournament, Qatari World Cup ambassador Khalid Salman called homosexuality a â€œdamage in the mindâ€ and â€œharamâ€ -- an Arabic term meaning â€œforbiddenâ€ -- during a German TV interview, sparking criticism in Europe.As a show of solidarity with the LGBTQ community, captains from several leading European countries, including England, France and Germany, said they would wear armbands in rainbow colours with the message â€œOne Loveâ€ during the tournament in an anti-discrimination campaign.But they backtracked after warnings from FIFA that they would be penalised for doing so.FIFA spokesman Bryan Swanson, who is gay, has insisted that all are welcome at the event.Marin LefÃ¨vreAll articlesTranslated byMary KulunduAll articlesWorld Cup 2022Facebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyFact-Checking StylebookTrainingContactMedia/Corporate offersCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

"Europe in brief: Brussels proposes Frontex on non-EU Western Balkans borders, West agrees to cap price on Russian oil, Von der Leyen responds to US President Bidenâ€™s climate package plan and Dutch opposition to Bulgaria's Schengen accession causes reactions in Sofia","Frontex could soon be deployed to non-EU borders in the Western Balkans to curb illegal migration. The EU, G7 and Australia have agreed to place a price cap on Russian oil. Von der Leyen calls for the EU to adapt state-aid schemes in response to the US green energy subsidy package. The Netherlandsâ€™ rejection of Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area causes strong reactions in SofiaFrontex on the borders between the countries of the Western BalkansBrussels (HINA) – Strengthening border controls on the Western Balkan migrant route and deploying Frontex personnel to borders between Western Balkan countries is one of the elements of an action plan to ease migrant pressure on the EU. Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson and Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas presented the plan on Monday.On the eve of the EU-Western Balkans summit in Tirana, the Commission announced a series of measures to address migrant pressure on the EU across the Western Balkans. Around 500 members of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) are currently deployed, but only to the external borders of the EU and Western Balkan countries. The Commission will negotiate a new mandate for Frontex with Western Balkan partners, which will enable the deployment of members of that agency to the borders between certain Western Balkan countries.The Commission notes that harmonization of visa policies is essential for the good functioning of the visa-free regime between the EU and the Western Balkans. A large number of migrants from Burundi, Tunisia, Cuba and India had arrived visa-free by plane in Serbia. Belgrade had granted some states a visa-free regime in exchange for the non-recognition of Kosovo. According to Frontex data, 281,000 unregistered entries into the EU through the Western Balkans were recorded during the first 10 months of this year, an increase of 77 percent compared to last year. (December 5)Von der Leyen wants to respond to US state aid with European investmentsBruges (Belga) – The European Unionâ€™s investment policy must be adjusted now that the United States has announced large-scale state aid for its green economy. Measures are needed to â€œrestore the balanceâ€ after the distortion of competition from Washington, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said during a speech at the College of Europe in Bruges on Sunday.Von der Leyen plans further discussions with the United States to â€œresolve the most problematic aspects of their investment plan.â€ But in addition, Brussels must adjust its â€œown rules to facilitate public investment in the (climate) transition, and we need to reassess the need for European funding,â€ von der Leyen said.She additionally stressed the importance of cooperation to address the climate challenge. With the US Inflation Reduction Act comes an investment plan of hundreds of billions of dollars. That massive investment should help build a new industrial ecosystem in strategic sectors for more environmentally friendly energy.The plan includes subsidies and tax credits, so that US companies use American products or produce in the States. Average workers also benefit: They can pocket up to 7,500 USD in tax credits when buying an electric car, provided the car is assembled at a North American factory and equipped with a locally manufactured battery.In early November, European finance ministers already expressed concern about Washingtonâ€™s plans. They could cause serious damage to European companies at a time when they are already struggling with higher energy prices, the ministers said. (December 4)West wants to significantly curb Russia's oil revenuesA deep pump is located near the city of Usinsk, 1500 kilometers northeast of Moscow. Photo: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP/dpaKyiv/London (dpa) – Energy supplies in particular are financing Russia's war of aggression in Ukraine. Now the European Union (EU), the leading Western industrialized nations (G7) and Australia want to significantly reduce Russiaâ€™s revenue. They want to dictate the price at which the country can sell its oil on the world market – no more than 60 USD (57 EUR) per barrel (159 liters).This is how it is supposed to work: For transport and the necessary services such as insurance, European shipping companies will only be allowed to take on transport to third countries, such as China and India, if the price does not exceed the cap. Shipping companies from the EU are estimated to operate more than half of all tankers worldwide.More than nine months after the start of the war, an EU oil embargo against Russia is also set to gradually take effect from December 5. The launch of the EU embargo and price cap will be followed by two further steps: After stopping maritime imports, Germany also wants to stop Russian oil deliveries via the Druzhba (Friendship) pipeline by the end of the year.The turmoil on the global energy markets is also being felt by consumers. According to the German government's plans, the gas and electricity price brake will put a stop to unjustified tariff increases. Price increases are to be prohibited until the end of 2023 – unless the supplier can prove ""that the increase is objectively justified,"" according to the drafts on the price brakes introduced in the Bundestag, the German parliament. (Dec. 4)Strong reactions in Sofia as Dutch are expected not to support Bulgariaâ€™s Schengen entrySofia/Brussels (BTA) – The Netherland's refusal to support Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area triggered a wave of reactions among the eastern European country's politicians and authorities. After the Dutch Broadcasting Corporation reported that the government in The Hague had judged that Bulgaria was not yet eligible to join Schengen, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev expressed disappointment: â€œRecently, three Bulgarian police officers died guarding the external border of the European Union. Today, the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, inadmissibly suggested that this border could be crossed for 50 euros. Instead of European solidarity, Bulgaria receives cynicism.â€EU Interior Commissioner Ilva Johansson and Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Ivan Demerdzhiev pointed out that in recent months, Bulgaria has successfully passed two additional consecutive inspections coordinated by the European Commission. These have shown once more that the country meets all the requirements of the Schengen legislation.The Bulgarian prosecutorâ€™s office said it does not have data supporting Rutteâ€˜s statement to public media NOS that the Netherlands â€œwant to rule out the possibility of illegally crossing the border between Turkey and the Schengen area into Bulgaria with a 50 euro banknote.â€â€œThe prosecutorâ€™s office has no data or evidence [of such a case]. If our partners in the law enforcement system of the Netherlands have them, I expect them to be made available to us in the framework of international legal assistance in accordance with the principles of the rule of law.â€Prosecutor General Ivan GeshevThe EU Justice and Home Affairs Council will vote on the Schengen enlargement on December 8.

The long and winding road to Schengen,"Every summer, tourists used to spend hours stuck in traffic jams on the border with Croatia. This will soon be a thing of the past. The Adriatic country is going to join the Schengen area without border controls as early as 2023. But for Bulgaria and Romania, the borderless dream has not come true yet.The world's largest free-travel zone has grown by one member. As of January 1, 2023, there will be 27 member states in the Schengen area, 23 EU countries plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein. Croatia, its latest member, will join the Schengen area in less than a month. Border controls at land and sea crossings will be abolished at the beginning of the year, with airports to follow suit by the end of March 2023. With Croatia's entry into Schengen, the area is expanding for the first time in over ten years.Existing Schengen members must unanimously approve the accession of a new member. The EUâ€™s interior ministers were to vote on December 8 on the expansion of the Schengen area to include three more countries: Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia. But while the way for Croatia to join was cleared, there was no consensus on the vote on Romania and Bulgaria due to opposition from Austria and the Netherlands.What is still keeping Romania and Bulgaria out of Schengen?Efforts by Bulgaria and Romania to join have been stalled for more than a decade since the commission first deemed the countries Schengen-ready in 2011.Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer recently made it clear that for him lifting border controls with Romania and Bulgaria was out of the question at present. The reason he gave was that too many unregistered migrants were currently arriving in Austria.Dutch opposition is only directed at Bulgaria, partly because of concerns regarding the rule of law. The Dutch parliament adopted a resolution in October, saying further analysis of the functioning of the rule of law and of the pervasiveness of corruption and organized crime in Bulgaria was needed. Last week, the Netherlands' government decided that Bulgaria did not yet meet the conditions for joining the Schengen area. Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra said it was too early to agree to Bulgaria's accession. However, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte held out the prospect of the country receiving approval next year.Attempts to find a solution to the issue of Bulgaria's admission to Schengen would continue until the end of this and into the next year, Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Demerdzhiev told Bulgarian journalists in Brussels on December 8.â€œBulgaria performed very well, the very conclusion of the European Commission and the reports and opinions showed that Bulgaria and Romania meet all the requirements for our admission to Schengen. The issue was political,â€ Demerdzhiev summarized. The deputy prime minister announced that efforts were expected to be continued by the Swedish Presidency of the Council of the EU from the beginning of next year. â€œNothing is lost, on the contrary, we are on the right track and have done what is expected of us,â€ he said.â€œSpecific dates have not been set, the talks are pending. Austria has made it clear that there are compromises it would accept. We also offer joint border outfits. We are ready for constructive solutions, as long as they are related to things that are useful for protecting the border. The Netherlands do not set such requirements, the dialogue is more difficult there, there is no constructivism in their position,â€ Demerdzhiev noted.Romaniaâ€™s prime minister Nicolae Ciuca expressed his â€œdeep disappointmentâ€ at the â€œlack of consensusâ€ in Thursday's JHA Council on Romania's accession to Schengen and stressed that Austria's vote was unjustified. ""All European states except one have agreed to open to Romanians the gates of the Schengen area in recognition of our preparation, but also of the continuous efforts for years to protect Europeâ€™s external borders. Unanimity was not possible today, because only one member state, Austria, refused Romania's entry. (...) We sincerely regret it and we do not understand the inflexible position shown by Austria,"" Nicolae Ciuca stated at the Victoria Palace on Thursday.European Commission expresses regret for â€œthe citizens of Bulgaria and Romaniaâ€The EU Commission recently certified that all three countries were meeting the necessary requirements for full Schengen accession. European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas said that all three countries had done more than what was asked of them. He said that ""some small hesitations"" that existed were of a political nature and based on the wrong assumption that with the extension of Schengen, there would be less control at the external borders. â€œWe are stronger, not weaker, through Schengenâ€™s enlargement,"" Schinas told reporters ahead of the vote on December 8.Ylva Johansson, European Commissioner for Home Affairs, welcomed Croatia to the Schengen area, expressing regret for the citizens of Romania and Bulgaria: â€œToday marks a good day for citizens of Croatia – welcome to Schengen. To citizens of Bulgaria and Romania I say this: You fully deserve to be part of Schengen and I will support every step to achieve this in my mandate.â€https://twitter.com/YlvaJohansson/status/1600859793740423171Slovenia backs Croatia's accession""We are happy that Croatia will join the Schengen area on 1 January. We expect that, as a member, it will meet its obligations regarding the protection of the Schengen border consistently,"" Sloveniaâ€™s Minister of the Interior Tatjana Bobnar told reporters. The Slovenian police has a strategy prepared based on which it will conduct oversight on the internal border and ensure safety of the Slovenian citizens as part of the ""compensatory measures"", she said.The mobile police units will place special emphasis on major road connections, railway and bus stations and other locations for which analyses will show an increased risk of illegal migration and cross-border crime.Regarding the Croatian-Slovenian border dispute, Slovenia stressed in a unilateral statement that the border between the two countries, which had been set by the 2017 arbitration, was final and binding, and had to be respected. On December 8, Croatia adopted a unilateral statement of its own, saying the country was not bound by the arbitration, since procedural irregularities had been perpetrated by Slovenia, and that the border was yet to be determined.Bosnia shares 1,000 kilometers of state border with CroatiaMeanwhile, non-EU member Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which shares 1,000 kilometers of border with Croatia, expressed a different set of worries, namely that Croatia joining Schengen would impose particular challenges on BiH. However, rapporteur of the European Parliament Paulo Rangel from the European Peopleâ€™s Party Group (EPP) said to the enr that Croatiaâ€™s entry into the Schengen area is in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to him, the abolition of internal border controls between the Schengen area and Croatia will in no way affect the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Instead, he added, it means that the European Union will move even closer to BiH, which was good for a country that was expecting to be granted candidate status for membership in the European Union as early as next week – and to one day become a member of the EU itself.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: EU states want cash ceiling of 10,000 euros, airlines will have to pay for CO2 emissions on intra-EU flights, EU and Western Balkan states meet in Tirana and EU wants to overcome Hungaryâ€™s blockade of aid to Ukraine","In a bid to combat money laundering, the EU states have called for a cash ceiling of 10,000 euros. EU airlines will have to pay for CO2 emissions produced on intra-EU flights. In Tirana, leaders have called to accelerate the EU accession process of Western Balkan states. And the EU Council works on overcoming the Hungarian blockage of aid for Ukraine. Combating money laundering – EU states call for a cash ceilingBrussels (APA) – The EU states are demanding a cash ceiling of 10,000 euros in the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. As announced by the Council, the member countries adopted their common position on the corresponding legislative texts on Wednesday. The individual nation states can also set a lower cash ceiling. Austriaâ€™s Finance Minister Markus Brunner (Austrian Peopleâ€™s Party/Ã–VP) recently criticized such a limit. â€œI am against upper limits in principle,â€ Brunner stressed on the sidelines of an EU finance ministersâ€™ meeting on Tuesday in Brussels.â€œCash is an important part of our identity in Europe, which is why cash must also go hand in hand with the digital option, the card option,â€ he said.His German counterpart Christian Lindner said something similar. Germany is against an upper limit, Lindner said according to German press agency dpa. He added that cash was also an expression of privacy and data protection.Apart from introducing a cash ceiling, the EU states also intend the new regulations to apply for, among other things, the crypto market and people who trade in precious stones and metals as well as cultural goods, the Council announced. Jewelers, watchmakers and goldsmiths would therefore also be affected by the regulation. In addition, beneficial ownership rules should be made more transparent and multi-layered ownership and control structures should be clarified. The decision had to be taken by a qualified majority, meaning a minimum of 15 out of the 27 EU states, which together account for at least 65 percent of the total population of the EU. Now the states still have to negotiate this with  the European Parliament before the new rules can enter into force. (December 7)EU: Airlines will have to pay for their CO2 emissionsBrussels (AFP) – Airlines will have to pay for the CO2 emissions of their intra-European flights, with the disappearance of free quotas that they previously enjoyed, according to an agreement reached by the EU on Wednesday. International flights will remain excluded.The agreement is part of the vast European climate plan. In addition to flights within the EU, it will also apply to flights between the EU and the United Kingdom or Switzerland, but for the moment, it excludes flights between Europe and the rest of the world, according to a press release from the Council of the EU. Intra-European flights are already subject to the carbon emission quota market (Emissions Trading System, ETS), where airlines can buy and trade the â€œpolluting rightsâ€ required to offset their emissions. Until now, they have been offered free quotas covering most of their programs to protect them in competition against foreign rivals. (December 7)Leaders of the European Union and Western Balkans: accelerate the accession processTirana (FENA) – European Union officials and leaders of the Western Balkan countries signed a joint declaration on relations between the EU and the region at a summit in Tirana. It said that the escalation of Russiaâ€™s aggressive war against Ukraine threatens European and global peace and security.â€œThe EU reconfirms its full and unequivocal commitment to the European Union membership perspective of the Western Balkans and calls for the acceleration of the accession process, based upon credible reforms by partners, fair and rigorous conditionality and the principle of own merits, which is in our mutual interest,â€ the document said. It welcomes the determination of the Western Balkans partners to support fundamental European values â€‹â€‹and principles in accordance with international laws.After the summit in Tirana, European Council President Charles Michel said that future generations would be safer and the future better if the Western Balkan countries became part of the European Union, stressing that the integration process was crucial.He also said that the partners need to work on improving the rule of law, the fight against corruption and similar problems that are happening in the Western Balkans. When prompted by a journalist about the possibility of granting Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) candidate status next week, he said that there was a clear proposal on the table and added that he supported BiHâ€™s efforts to secure candidate status.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also stressed that support for the integration of the Western Balkans into the EU is very strong and expressed support for BiHâ€™s candidate status.As part of the summit, leaders of the Western Balkan countries attended the signing of a statement concerning roaming costs between the European Union and regional telecom operators.The signing was attended by Michel, von der Leyen, the President of Montenegro Milo Djukanovic, Kosovoâ€™s President Vjosa Osmani, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ and North Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar Kovacevski.The roaming declaration allows for the reduction of roaming prices between the EU and the region from 1 October 2023. (December 6)EU wants to unblock loan to Ukraine without HungaryBrussels (Belga) – Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbanâ€˜s government blocks the loan which the EU promised to Ukraine, saying they prefer bilateral assistance. Hungary may want to pressure the EU into releasing the 13 billion euros of cohesion and recovery support intended for the country. Hungary is in danger of losing it because it is not doing enough to combat corruption and ensure the independence of the judiciary.The European finance ministers, who met in Brussels on Tuesday, are now working on a solution to be able to grant the loan without Hungary, according to Czech minister Zbynek Stanjura, who chaired the meeting. The plan is still to make an initial deposit of a loan in January, with interest rates to be borne by the European countries.Hungary is also opposed to the introduction of a minimum tax on the profits of multinationals. Like the loan to Ukraine, Budapest is taking that dossier hostage to keep the other member states from blocking cohesion and recovery funds for Hungary.According to Belgium, these four dossiers should be dealt with together. They will probably be reviewed again next week at the level of the ambassadors before returning to the ministersâ€™ tables. Some member states would like to bring the discussion to the level of the heads of government, who will meet in Brussels for a summit on 15 and 16 December.

"Europe in brief: Alleged corruption in the EU Parliament, hydrogen pipeline between Spain and France, EU-US subsidies dispute and can Bosnia and Herzegovina expect EU candidacy?","The European Parliament has been in the eye of the storm since it was announced that a large-scale corruption case is under investigation. Other news: A green hydrogen pipeline to be built between the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of Europe, subsidy dispute between the EU and the US, and potential EU enlargement in the Western Balkans.Corruption scandal shakes European ParliamentBrussels (Belga) – This weekend, a court in Belgium announced that it is investigating a large-scale corruption case in the European Parliament. On Sunday, the Belgian Federal Prosecutorâ€™s Office reported that four suspects were placed under arrest. â€œThey are accused of membership in a criminal organization, money laundering and corruption,â€ it said.According to the Federal Prosecutor's Office, investigations have been ongoing for several months. Investigators from the Federal Judicial Police suspected that a Persian Gulf country was trying to influence the decision-making of the European Parliament by paying large sums of money or offering significant gifts to parties who hold strategic parliamentary positions.Sixteen searches took place on Friday and six people were arrested. Investigators also seized 600,000 euros in cash, computer equipment and cell phones. Arrest warrants were issued for four of the six people on Sunday.One of them is Eva Kaili, who was first suspended and then removed as Vice-President of the European Parliament on December 13. The Greek socialist will not be able to invoke her parliamentary immunity because she was caught red-handed. The Greek anti money laundering authority has already announced that her assets are frozen.Belgian MEP Marc Tarabella (PS/S&D) now confirmed that he was also searched on Saturday night. ""The court does its research, which I think is normal. I have nothing to hide and will answer all questions to clarify this matter,"" he said. For her part, his colleague and fellow party member Marie Arena confirmed that her assistant's office was searched on Friday. (December 13)Dispute over US subsidies: EU Commission expects results in weeksBrussels (dpa) – In the dispute over billions of dollars in subsidies for US companies, the EU Commission expects concessions from Washington by the end of the year. It was important that negotiations with the US government would deliver concrete results before the end of the year, said EU Commission Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis. Then it would be possible to analyze to what extent the EU's concerns had been met and what next steps could be taken.The background of the dispute between the EU and the US is a huge investment program that many in Europe see as disadvantageous. Washington wants to invest tens of billions of dollars in climate protection over the next ten years, for example to promote the production of solar cells and wind turbines. It is now feared that European and German companies will move sites to the US or open new plants there.""Our problem with the US is not the subsidies as such, but the fact that they are granted in a discriminatory way,"" Dombrovskis said. (December 10)Getting candidate status would be great incentive for BiHâ€™s entire societySarajevo (FENA) – Edin DilberoviÄ‡, head of the Directorate for European Integration (DEI), believes that obtaining the EU candidate status would be a great incentive for the entire society of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). It would send a message that goals are achievable and results are rewarded. He added that candidate status was a procedural step that had to be taken by any country that wanted to have access to the European family.""For some countries, it was the first step, and for us in BiH it is a step that requires a lot of preliminary work in adapting the legal, political and economic system to the rules in force in the European Union,"" DilberoviÄ‡ said.According to him, since the publication of the European Commission's opinion, the work of the institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina has focused on 14 key priorities that will remain in place even after obtaining candidate status. He says that a number of tasks related to these priorities have been realized or their implementation is underway, but some of the most important laws have yet to be adopted. These include, for example, the High Judicial and Prosecutorial Council Law, the Law on Courts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Law on Prevention of Conflict of Interest.European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi said the European Commission has sent a proposal to the member states, the European Council, to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status.

Photo: EFE/ Kai ForsterlingAlicante (EFE) – The so-called H2MED green energy subsea corridor, which will ultimately transport hydrogen, will consist of two pipelines: one between Portugal and Spain and the other between Spain and France. The cost will be around 2.5 billion euros.The project, which is expected to be operational by 2030, is seeking EU funding, according to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez. He described the submission of H2MED before the December 15 deadline as a ""first milestone"" for it to be declared a project of common interest by Brussels.â€œIt is a very good example of how three states understand how to cooperate and act together for the benefit of the entire European Union,â€said Antonio Costa, Prime Minister of Portugal.The H2MED corridor will consist of two sections, an existing section to be upgraded between Celorico da Beira (Portugal) and the Spanish city of Zamora, called CelZa, and a new section between Barcelona (Spain) and Marseille (France), known as BarMar. Both will be part of the ""first major hydrogen corridor in the European Union"", an infrastructure that will be able to transport 10 percent of the total renewable hydrogen targeted by member states in the RePower EU plan.

"UK county council approved traffic scheme, not 'climate lockdown trial' for 2024","After Oxfordshire County Council in southeast England approved a Â£6.5 million ($7.93 million) trial to reduce traffic congestion, false posts wrongly suggested that councillors had approved a ""climate lockdown"" for 2024. The council's spokesperson said that residents would be free to move around the city and no lockdown had been ordered. A campaigner who backed the trial told AFP the scheme aims to help to reduce congestion, while an Oxfordshire councillor who opposed the trial said the social media posts were ""untrue"".Social media users shared a screenshot of a misleading article titled ""Oxfordshire County Council Pass Climate Lockdown 'trial' to Begin in 2024"".The article, which was published by online magazine Vision News on November 30, suggested Oxfordshire residents would be ""confined to their local neighbourhood and have to ask permission to leave it all to 'save the planet'.""â€œOxfordshire County Council yesterday approved plans to lock residents into one of six zones to 'save the planet' from global warming.""The latest stage in the '15 minute city' agenda is to place electronic gates on key roads in and out of the city, confining residents to their own neighbourhoods,â€ the text reads.A screenshot of the misleading post, captured on December 9, 2022The claim circulated after the council approved a Â£6.5 million ($7.93 million) traffic filters trial to limit private vehicles travelling on busy city routes during peak hours on November 29.According to the countyâ€™s website, six traffic filters will be installed inside Oxford roads â€œto reduce traffic, make bus journeys faster and make walking and cycling safer.â€The screenshot and the article have been shared more than 940 times, with the claim spreading online in Australia, the United States, Canada and the UK.Sky News Australia host Rowan Dean discussed Vision News' screenshot on a TV programme and his reporting was subsequently shared by Canadian right-wing professor Jordan Peterson.US Fox News commentator Steve Milloy also shared a similar claim to his 63.9k followers on Twitter.The claim has also spread in other languages including French and Portuguese.However, the claim is false.According to a council spokesperson, residents will not be locked down in their homes as part of the plans, which aim to reduce congestion.â€œTraffic filters are not a climate lockdown, they are designed to reduce traffic on inner city roads in Oxford,â€ the spokesperson told AFP on December 8.""Everywhere in the city will still be accessible by car, although some private car drivers may need to use a different route during the operating hours of the traffic filters.""The council issued a statement in response to the misleading claim circulating online on December 7, saying its staff and councillors had been abused due to ""inaccurate information"" on social media and that it would report the most extreme abuse to the police.Conservative county councillor Liam Walker, who opposed proposals for the traffic filters trial, tweeted in response to the online claims: ""I donâ€™t support the LibDem/Labour/Green bus gate plans but this is a completely untrue tweet. Residents aren't on lockdown & traffic can enter/exit the different zones.""Traffic schemeThe six traffic filters will operate seven days a week, except for two filters on Hollow Way and Marston Ferry Road, which will operate Monday to Saturday, according to the council's website.Private vehicles without permits travelling through filters will be charged a penalty of Â£70 ($85.3). Other vehicles -- including buses, coaches, taxis, vans, mopeds, motorbikes and HGVs -- will be allowed on the routes at all times.Campaign director for Oxfordshire Liveable Streets, Zuhura Plummer told AFP on December 7 that claims of a ""climate lockdown"" were not true.""It's a scheme to help speed up buses as they get caught in a lot of traffic, and to make cycling safer and more pleasant,"" she said.Vision News falsely claimed that residents would be locked into one of six zones as part of a ""15-minute-city"" agenda.Plummer said: ""Nobody is kept in their houses and the city is not divided into zones, there are no barriers and the roads are not closed. Any claims of this sort are categorically untrue.""On its website, the council says proposals for ""15-minute neighbourhoods"" aims to ensure that every resident has all the essentials (shops, healthcare, parks) within a 15-minute walk of their home.The council's spokesperson said: ""All parts of the city will still be accessible by private cars, and there will not be any electronic gates or other physical barriers on roads.""According to the council, the trial is set to be held for six months from late 2023 or early 2024, before a public consultation to decide on a long-term strategy.Kate TANAll articlesAFP AustraliaAll articlesCLIMATEFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyFact-Checking StylebookTrainingContactMedia/Corporate offersCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

Bosnia and Herzegovina takes another step towards EU accession,"Almost seven years after submitting a formal application for EU membership, Bosnia and Herzegovina finally received the unanimous support of 27 EU heads of state and government to join the bloc. But now the Western Balkan country of 3.3 million people must deliver reforms.After years of standstill, Russia's war on Ukraine has breathed fresh life into the EU's willingness to consider welcoming more of its eastern neighbors to its ranks. The Member States agreed on December 15 to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) ""candidate status"" to join the union, putting the volatile Balkan nation at the start of a long road to membership. A recommendation to this effect was made by the European ministers of the EU states in Brussels on Tuesday. One of the reasons for this move are concerns that the country, which has a population of around 3.3 million, could otherwise increasingly orient itself towards Russia or China.In the wake of the decisions to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova in June 2022, EU member states such as Austria and Slovenia in particular had urged the EU to also grant candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina. The fact that BiH was once again ignored in this process caused great disappointment in the country. It was offered the prospect of EU accession as early as 2003, and in 2016 officially submitted an application for membership.European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi said that the Councilâ€™s decision was sending a very clear message to the citizens of BiH that the EU stands by the country. He added that it was now necessary for BiH to show its readiness to fulfill the conditions set earlier, â€œEurope delivers and now we want to see Bosnia and Herzegovina deliver as well.â€ The conditions mentioned by Commissioner VÃ¡rhelyi are 14 key reforms that the European Commission put before BiH back in May 2019. They concern reforms in several areas, including democracy, the rule of law and public administration.Political commentators in Bosnia and Herzegovina believe that the EU should have granted Bosnia and Herzegovina candidate status at the same time as the majority of other countries in the Western Balkans. This could have helped to facilitate the resolution of numerous internal problems in the country. For example, the government of the Republika Srpska entity maintains close economic and political ties with Moscow, and the absence of candidate status for EU membership only favored the growth of Russian influence.EU candidate status for BiH benefits both partiesAhead of the vote at an EU summit on December 15, Latvian Prime Minister KriÅ¡jÄnis KariÅ†Å¡ said the decision was ""mutually beneficial to both the Western Balkans and the European Union as a whole."" ""The European Union has a geopolitical interest in the Balkans,"" he added.EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said on the sidelines of the EU summit, â€œIt is a good occasion for the leadership of Bosnia and Herzegovina to push for the reforms. This is the occasion for the country to really embark on the European path. Itâ€™s a very important step for Bosnia Herzegovina and for the whole region.â€Due to the ongoing political crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina, little has been done so far to implement the set conditions. All public opinion surveys show that membership in the EU is one of the rare goals strongly supported by all three nationalities and throughout BiH. All the parliamentary parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina that are participating in the negotiations on forming a government after the elections in October have put the continuation of the European path high on their list of priorities, regardless of the fact that no one knows how long the journey will take.Slovenia advocates Western Balkans enlargementSlovenia has dedicated a lot of effort to explain to its partners why, given the geopolitical situation, BiH should receive candidate status. The decision to grant Bosnia and Herzegovina EU candidate status was described in Ljubljana as â€œa great success of Slovenian foreign policy."" At the same time, Ljubljana stresses that Slovenia is committed to bringing the entire Western Balkans into the EU as soon as possible.Prime Minister Robert Golob said at the time of the EU Council decision on 13 December that BiH had been waiting for this decision for twenty years. In the EU, he said, trust needs to be built towards the people of BiH.Slovenian top officials have put advocacy of BiH high on their foreign policy agenda, and Slovenian calls were further amplified by the developments in BIH at the beginning of the year. President Borut Pahor has repeatedly warned that the process of EU enlargement to the Western Balkan countries is too slow and that BiH should be granted candidate status immediately.Candidate status is also a clear signal to the political structures in BiH, which now have a full mandate to carry out as many reforms as possible and to show their voters that they share their vision of the country's future in the EU. ""There were many doubts about this from member states as well as the European Commission, but I think that in the end we were able to prove with arguments that Bosnia and Herzegovina has made significant progress over time,"" said Foreign Ministry State Secretary Marko Å tucin.Faris KoÄan, a researcher at the Centre for International Relations at the Ljubljana School of Business and Economics, believes that Slovenia played an important role in the decision, as it is perceived – alongside Croatia and Austria – as an EU member state that represents a kind of bridge between the EU and the Western Balkans because of its own history. ""In this context, it was important that Slovenia, together with its partners – Austria in particular, but also Croatia – put BiH high on the EU agenda,"" he added.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Austria calls for barriers at EU external borders, corruption allegations in the EU parliament, EU agrees on lifting visa requirements for Kosovoâ€™s citizens and the 27 Member States canâ€™t agree on a price cap on imported gas","At the EU summit, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer asked to â€œbreak the taboo on fences,â€ the suspected MEP Eva Kailli claims innocence in the corruption scandal that rocks Brussels, the EU agrees on a visa-free regime for Kosovo and the 27 EU Member States fail to agree on a price cap for imported gas. EU summit – Nehammer: â€œWe must finally break the taboo on fencesâ€Brussels (APA) – In view of the high number of asylum seekers, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Austria Peopleâ€™s Party/Ã–VP) has called for more barriers at the EUâ€™s external borders. â€œWe must finally break the taboo on fences,â€ Nehammer said ahead of the EU summit on Thursday in Brussels. Bulgaria needed to build a fence supported by financial resources from the European Union.This comes after Austria had blocked Bulgaria and Romaniaâ€™s accession to the Schengen area due to increased irregular migration. Nehammer said he is in â€œclose contactâ€ with the heads of state of the two countries. â€œThe Bulgarian president himself states that it is necessary to strengthen the fence against Turkey,â€ the chancellor said. According to Sofia, it would need around 2 billion euros to pay for such measures.Brussels authorities repeatedly stated that there was no money for walls, fences and barbed wire, only for infrastructure on the border. One argument for this was that otherwise there would be a lack of money elsewhere, such as for the coast guard.â€œFences themselves are nothing new,â€ Nehammer further explained with regard to the barriers on the Greek-Turkish border. â€œBut so far the nation states have been left alone; the EU Commission is not releasing the funds.â€ Bulgaria had met all necessary technical criteria for joining Schengen in 2011, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said in response to Austriaâ€™s Schengen veto. Any objection from the countries concerned was motivated domestically, he added. Radev is convinced that the majority of migrants do not come through Bulgaria. â€œWe are highly motivated to protect our borders,â€ emphasized the Bulgarian president, pointing out that three Bulgarian police had died on the border. â€œThey were shot dead while protecting the EUâ€™s external border,â€ says Radev. He therefore called for Bulgaria to be regarded as a country showing solidarity.  (December 15)Alleged corruption: MEP Eva Kaili remains in custody, claims innocenceBrussels (AFP) – Greek Member of European Parliament Eva Kaili, who is implicated in a resounding corruption scandal involving Qatar and claims her innocence, remained in custody on Wednesday after her court appearance was postponed until December 22.Stripped of her position as Vice-President of the European Parliament, Eva Kaili proclaimed her innocence via one of her lawyers in Athens, saying she did not know about the existence of the bags of banknotes found at her home in Brussels.Arrested in Brussels on Friday, the 44-year-old is suspected of having been paid by Qatar to defend the interests of the emirate, which is currently hosting the football world cup.Three other suspects detained since Sunday in this – as the federal prosecutor's office stated - Â â€œcase of corruption, money laundering and criminal organization within the European Parliamentâ€ appeared before a court in Brussels on Wednesday.Francesco Giorgi, Eva Kailiâ€™s partner, as well as former MEP Pier Antonio Panzeri, are being kept in pre-trial detention, the federal prosecutorâ€™s office announced. (December 14, 2022)EU agrees to visa-free regime for Kosovo citizensBrussels (dpa) – Citizens of the Republic of Kosovo will be able to travel to the EU without a visa in the future. Negotiators from the EU states and the European Parliament agreed to the measure on Wednesday. The EU Parliament announced that the visa-free regime for the Western Balkans state should apply from 2024 at the latest.Holders of a Kosovo passport could then come to the EU without a visa for short stays of up to 90 days. The same rules would then apply to the entire Western Balkans, including countries such as Serbia or Montenegro. Wednesdayâ€™s agreement has to be confirmed by Parliament and the EU states, which is considered a mere formality.Kosovo also officially applied for EU membership on Wednesday. Formally, the country only has â€œEU membership prospectsâ€. The main obstacle to EU rapprochement is that five EU member countries – Spain, Romania, Slovakia, Greece and Cyprus – do not recognize Kosovo. (December 14)EU members fail to agree on price limit for imported gasBrussels (Europa Press) – The member states of the European Union are still unable to reach an agreement to set a cap on the price of gas imports in times of crisis.Faced with negotiations between energy ministers stalling, the heads of state and government urged the ministers on Thursday to resolve differences in order to reach an agreement and thus â€œprotect citizens and the economy from excessively high pricesâ€ in consequence of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.On the one hand, there is a group of countries, led by Spain, that do not want to set too high a price cap. On the other hand, there are those countries that refuse to lower the limit for fear of damaging supply security. Thus, Germany refuses to apply a ceiling of less than 200 euros per megawatt hour, a figure that is unacceptable for the other block.The lack of agreement on this issue is also blocking two other regulations: The ones on joint purchases of gas and on the acceleration of permits for renewable energies.

Northern hemisphere snowfall data do not disprove global warming,"Social media posts claim record snow cover in the northern hemisphere in November 2022 is evidence against climate change. This is false; experts say a single month's measurement does not disprove the overall global warming trend, and data show snow extent varies and that cover has decreased.During the United Nations (UN) COP27 climate summit in Egypt, ""November's snowfall across the Northern Hemisphere was running at rates exceeding a half-a-century average,"" says a December 3, 2022 article from Zero Hedge, a conspiratorial website that has previously published misinformation. ""Most mainstream media outlets overlooked this data because it is an inconvenient truth for the climate change narrative they're pushing.""The claim was republished by blogs and shared in posts on Facebook and Twitter, including in French. An article tweeted by Patrick Moore, a prominent climate change denier who has made false claims about his links to Greenpeace, was shared thousands of times on Twitter.Screenshot of a Facebook post taken December 6, 2022Screenshot of a tweet taken December 6, 2022The articles cite graphs and maps with data from the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Global Snow Lab at Rutgers University in the state of New Jersey. The numbers indicate northern hemisphere snow extent reached about 41 million square kilometers (16 million square miles) in November, a 56-year high.But experts say the data do not reflect the trend for average snow extent.""You can't link one map or even one month to global climate change. One needs to look over years if not decades to get a sense of where and why the extent of snow cover may or may not be changing,"" said climatologist David Robinson, director of the Rutgers Global Snow Lab, in an email on November 28.Snow cover decreasedMore recent data show snow extent in the northern hemisphere has again dropped below the record level.""Mid-November snow cover extent was well above normal across northern hemisphere lands. However, as November ends, that is not the case,"" Robinson said. ""For instance, there has been major melting of the earlier snowpack across much of North America such that extent for late November has fallen below normal.""The Rutgers Global Snow Lab graph cited in the Zero Hedge article compares monthly readings for snow cover in the northern hemisphere to the maximum and minimum values recorded since records began in 1967, as well as the average.The graph shows snow cover (purple line) surpassed the record (blue line) in mid-November. An updated graph published by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) for the week ending November 28 showed that month's reading had dipped below the record again.Screenshot of the WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch page showing a NOAA/Rutgers graph of northern snow extentScreenshot of a graph from the WMO's Global Cryosphere Watch page showing snow extent dipping in late November 2022A 2019 study examined six datasets stretching back to 1981 and found decreasing trends for both the extent and mass of snow in the northern hemisphere (NH).The study noted ""strong negative NH snow extent trends in early winter and spring and consistently strong, negative snow mass trends from November through May.""

"Europe in brief: EU reforms carbon market, Doha brusquely rejects EU corruption accusations, Slovenia leads with ambitious targets in biodiversity protection","The EU has agreed on a reform of emissions trading, the key climate protection instrument. A week after the corruption scandal in the European Parliament, Qatar has issued a statement warning of possible negative repercussions for relations with the EU. At the UNâ€™s Biodiversity Conference, Brussels joined forces to significantly increase funding to counteract biodiversity loss.Climate: EU reaches agreement to reform carbon marketBrussels (AFP) – End of free â€œrights to polluteâ€ for manufacturers, taxation of emissions related to heating and cars, a social fund for the transition: On Sunday, the EU has reached an agreement on a comprehensive reform of its carbon market, the centerpiece of the European climate plan.After tough talks, negotiators from the European Parliament and EU member states agreed to raise the reformâ€™s ambitions and expand its scope. The multi-faceted reform, proposed by the European Commission in July 2021, should make it possible to meet the ambitious greenhouse gas reduction objectives of the EUâ€™s climate plan.The carbon market will gradually be extended to the maritime sector, to emissions from intra-European flights and, from 2028, to waste incineration sites, subject to a favorable study by Brussels. (December 18)Doha threatens Brussels, â€œrelations and gas at riskâ€Brussels (ANSA) – Qatar is sharply warningÂ the EU about the risks of a breakdown in relations, starting with gas supplies.Â A week afterÂ theÂ corruption scandalÂ rocked the European Parliament, Doha issued a statement warning of a possible negative impact on relations with the European Union, speaking of a ""discriminatory restrictionâ€ with regard to the exclusion from all legislative work and theÂ banÂ of Qatarâ€™s delegates to the European Parliament. ""It will have a negative effect on regional and global cooperation and ongoing talks on energy, poverty and security,""Â reads the statement, which accusesÂ the Belgian authoritiesÂ of usingÂ â€œinaccurate informationâ€.â€œWe firmly reject the accusations that associate our government with misconduct: Qatar was not the only partyÂ mentionedÂ in the investigation, yet our country has been criticized and attacked exclusively.â€ Doha has started a massive expansion in liquefied natural gas (LNG) production rightÂ whenÂ the EU seeks to diversify supplies from Russia. In the summer, Qatar signed wide-ranging agreements, also with Eni, for the North Field Expansion project. Within the scope of this project, LNG production will increase by 48 million tons per year in 2025-2027, bringing total annual exports to 126 million tons, about the total amount ofÂ pipeline gas and LNG suppliesÂ from Russia to Europe.Meanwhile, the investigation by the Belgian authorities is in full swing. Belgian judge Michel Claise requested from the Milan prosecutor's office to obtain the Italian bank accounts of former MEP and founder of the non-governmental organizationÂ Fight Impunity, Antonio Panzeri, as well as those of his daughter Maria Dolores Colleoni, of the International Trade Union ConfederationÂ SecretaryÂ General, Luca Visentini, and of Francesco Giorgi, Panzeri's former parliamentary assistant and former European Parliament Vice President Eva Kaili's partner.The Guardia di Finanza allegedly searched Panzeri's home for documents related to accounts in Italy, but also abroad, at Lift bank in Brazil, opening the possibility of a South AmericanÂ trail. At Claiseâ€™s request, checks by the Aosta Prosecutor's Office are also underway on alleged money laundering carried out in the purchase of an apartment in Cervinia by NiccolÃ² FigÃ -Talamanca, the founder of the NGOÂ No Peace without Justice, who is under arrest as well. (December 18)Environment Minister BreÅ¾an at COP15: Slovenia leads by example in biodiversity conservationMontreal (STA) – Slovenia is committed to ambitious targets in its efforts to counteract the decline in biodiversity and is leading by example with more than 40 percent of protected areas.

Made in Europe? The EU's response to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA),"The US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) was passed in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the public deficit and inflation. EU officials had initially welcomed this as a step in the right direction towards mitigating climate change. However, at the time they overlooked the protectionist aspects of the law.At their last summit of the year, European Union heads of state and government called on the European Commission to propose measures for the improvement of climate investment and the competitiveness of European industry until the beginning of 2023. This came in response to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) – a law which the government leaders regard as discriminatory against European companies.The alarm bells went off in the EU once the bloc realized that the IRA, passed in August of this year, included massive tax breaks and subsidies amounting to 367 billion US dollars to boost US domestic production of, among other things, electric vehicles, solar panels and batteries. The EU regards these subsidies as contrary to fair competition, as most electric vehicle manufacturers could relocate their production to the US. Today, more than 25 percent of electric cars are produced in Europe, while only about 10 percent are produced in the US.The US legislation foresees tax credits of 7,500 dollars per vehicle for US consumers who purchase electric cars, provided those meet two conditions: One is that at least 40 percent of the raw materials used in the electric battery are extracted in the US or in a country with which the US has a trade agreement. The EU and the US are major trading partners, but they have no such deal. By 2026, the threshold for the tax credits will be raised to 80 percent of raw materials.The other condition is that at least 50 percent of the battery components are made or assembled in the US, Canada or Mexico, and by 2029, that threshold will be raised to 100 percent.The IRA foresees a generous incentive program for other areas as well, such as new tax credits to promote carbon capture, clean hydrogen and investments in green energy technologies and the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. In these areas, Europe is currently the world market leader.EUâ€™s new industrial policy will be prominent on 2023 agenda""We need to give our answer, our European IRA,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in the European Parliament last week.A joint EU-US task force to address the EUâ€™s concerns regarding the US subsidy program for green technology has not succeeded so far. Meanwhile, Germany and France outlined their strategy on how to respond on December 20. Accordingly, the EU should be more flexible at introducing state-aid rules for investments in the green sector, following the US model, and halve the approval time for decisions. German Minister of Economy Robert Habeck and French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire also pushed for the US to include European companies in tax breaks planned for US businesses.Apart from proposing changes to public investment rules in the bloc, Germany and France also suggested future consultations between the US and the EU over government support granted to the industry. The EUâ€™s central problem is that not all member states have the same fiscal capacity to subsidize production. This could lead to a race in subsidies – even within the EU. And this could again result in major distortions of the single market, which would mortally endanger the bloc.Absent from the Franco-German strategy was the commission call to set up a fund for the bloc's entire industrial base funded with joint-EU borrowing. Paris and Berlin want to use untapped resources from the EU's Covid-19 relief fund, work with the European Investment Bank (EIB) and develop the bloc's capital markets for more sources of funding.One of the options is the newly established European Sovereignty Fund to support EU innovation and industrial programs. This gives raise to questions that need to be answered – for instance how big that fund should be, how it should be financed and who would determine what is to be subsidized and by what means.Spain supports the EU taking measures against the US law because it could affect Spanish investments, for example in hydrogen, and has a clear component of protectionism. Government sources said that they were ""not opposed"" to having a common financing instrument that was raised by common debt, but warned that the important question was how the money was going be spend.On the sidelines of the recent EU summit, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob noted that ""this act is not anti-China or anti-Europe, it simply is pro- USA."" Be that as it may, Slovenia's exports would be affected by the US law despite the countryâ€™s small size. Dejan Å½idan, State Secretary at the Ministry of Economy in Slovenia, regards the act as an impulse to think about whether the EU really does enough to support its own industry.According to Jure Stojan, director of research and development at the Institute for Strategic Solutions (ISR), not having a ""uniform European scheme and allowing state aid would be bad. Slovenia would have a hard time keeping up with the aid larger member states can offer their companies."" The researcher believes that given the balance of power in the Capitol, ""it is unfathomable that President Biden's administration would pass amendments to the act. This limits the likelihood of the EU being granted any major exemptions.""Maintaining Europeâ€™s attractivenessGina Raimondo, U.S. Secretary of Commerce, Antony Blinken, U.S. Secretary of State, Katherine Tai, U.S. Trade Representative, Valdis Dombrovskis, European Union Commissioner for Trade and Margrethe Vestager, European Union Commissioner for Competition, at the U.S.-European Union Trade and Technology Council talks. Photo: Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP/dpaWhile Washington and Brussels continue to negotiate possible measures to mitigate the impact on EU businesses and avoid a trade war, the EU 27 believe that measures to maintain Europe's competitiveness and investment attractiveness and reduce its dependency on third countries for essential supplies are needed in any case.In conclusions approved during the recent summit, the leaders stressed the importance of an ""ambitious European industrial policy to make Europe ready for ecological transition and reduce strategic dependencies (â€¦) in the current global context.â€ The aim, they said, was to ""safeguard Europe's economic, industrial and technological base"" at a time of energy price shocks, and to maintain Europe's ""global competitiveness.""Europeâ€™s response to the IRA could take shape at the extraordinary summit of the leaders of the EU member states on February 9 and 10, where the main topics will be migration and the EU's global competitiveness. Sweden, which is taking over the six-month Presidency of the Council of the European Union, stressed that transatlantic cooperation would be one of the key priorities.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Germany's energy bailout, Austria's Schengen veto, Spain to receive EU funding to strengthen health sector","The European Commission clears Germanyâ€™s bailout of gas giant Uniper. Austriaâ€™s Chancellor defends Schengen veto against Romania and Bulgaria. Spain receives EU aid to hire healthcare workers. German Minister of Economy Habeck: European Commission's state aid rules on Uniper show a sense of proportionBerlin (dpa) – German Minister of Economy Robert Habeck has described the conditions imposed by the European Commission with regard to the rescue package for Uniper as aid rules with a sense of proportion. On Wednesday, the green party minister said it was reasonable to have rules of the game when nationalizing a company that was competing in the market. While market opportunities would be curtailed, the company would still be able to turn a profit.On Tuesday, the Commission gave its approval under state aid law for a stabilization package for Uniper worth billions of euros. It provides for a temporary, extensive nationalization of the energy group. In the course of this, a capital increase of up to 34.5 billion euros is possible. For competitive reasons, Uniper had to commit to selling several subsidiaries and other company assets by the end of 2026. These include Russian company Unipro, hard coal-fired power plant Datteln 4 and the German district heating business. (December 21)Schengen – Nehammer denies ""political agitation""Karl Nehammer, Chancellor of Austria, speaks to journalists upon his arrival at the EU summit.  Foto: Virginia Mayo/AP/dpaVienna (APA) – In a Christmas review after the Council of Ministers, Austrian Federal Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Ã–VP) has defended Austria's veto against the Schengen accession of Romania and Bulgaria. This was not a question of ""political agitation"", he said. Emotionalization in such matters was a mistake. Rather, it was a matter of facts, he pointed out once again, saying that according to the Ã–VP, a large portion of the refugee influx came via Romania and Bulgaria.The Chancellor sees himself in good exchange with Bulgaria. He announced that he would also visit the country and promised Sofia appropriate support. Nehammer did not comment directly on the fact that Hungary should actually be the target of Austrian criticism because it just waves the refugees through. However, he stressed that he was ""not naive for a second"" about the country. But since Hungary is Austria's neighbour, there is a need for cooperation on security policy, he said.Nehammer did not dispute the fact that the Green Party thinks very little of the Schengen veto. But even where the Ã–VP and the Green Party disagree, they try to manage it in such a way that there is no deadlock, no blockade.Vice-Chancellor Werner Kogler (Green Party) also stressed that they were working on the conditions under which the accessions could take place. Ideally, they were aiming for this to happen during the Swedish Council Presidency, i. e. in the first half of 2023.At the EU interior ministers' meeting on December 8, Interior Minister Gerhard Karner (Ã–VP) had agreed to a Schengen enlargement to include Croatia, but at the same time vetoed Romania and Bulgaria. This led to massive criticism and diplomatic disgruntlement, especially on the part of Romania, where the predominant sentiment is that the country has been unfairly deprived of its Schengen membership.Spain will receive an additional 1.8 billion euros from EUâ€™s Cohesion FundBrussels (Europa Press) – Spain will receive an additional 1.8 billion euros from the European Cohesion Fund to sustain employment, finance temporary lay-offs and strengthen the health sector after the coronavirus pandemic, the European Commission said on Tuesday.Specifically, the national employment, education and training program will be financed with 1.1 billion euros to pay for temporary lay-offs, a key measure to protect employment after the economic difficulties unleashed by the pandemic. Since 2021, European funds have supported this measure with a total of 2.2 billion euros, benefiting nearly 750,000 workers in Spain.The European funds will support employment programs in different autonomous communities. Those will help people to acquire new skills and will also reinforce the healthcare system with new hires.This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

EU heads into 2023 in crisis mode,"Preoccupied by multiple crises, the EU has seen a restless year. Many of the calamities which shook the EU in 2022 will still be around in 2023. A year of multiple crises is coming to an end. Shaken by high energy prices, increasing migrant figures, an alleged corruption scandal in the EU parliament and the Russian war in Ukraine, the EU is entering 2023. These problems will hardly turn around at the threshold of 2023 – nevertheless, one EU member state has reason to celebrate.Access to Eurozone and SchengenCroatia is coming out of the year 2022 as a fully integrated member of the European Union. From the beginning of next year, the country will belong to both the Eurozone and the Schengen area without internal border controls.Thus, Croatia joined the club of what is now 15 countries (Belgium, Estonia, France, Greece, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain) which are members of the most integrated confederations on the continent – the EU, the Eurozone, the Schengen area and NATO. Croatia is the one of those members of these clubs that used to have a communist one-party system 30 years ago, just like Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Slovenia.The membership of Croatia in the Eurozone and Schengen is expected to help the country to further strengthen the economy and enhance the standard of living for its citizens. In the meantime, Bulgaria and Romania will still have to wait for the accession to the Schengen zone. The other EU member states couldnâ€™t reach the needed unanimity and decided in December 2022 to not let them enter the free travel zone together with Croatia. Therefore, Bulgaria expects the EU to help managing the countryâ€™s external borders and hopes to join the free travel area, along with Romania, by October 2023.Bulgaria is also further preparing for the membership of the Eurozone in order to introduce the euro by January 2024.Russian war in Ukraine and energy pricesThe Russian war and its repercussions are likely to continue driving the EUâ€™s agenda in 2023. One effect is the strong rise in energy prices in the EU. After months of debate on how to tackle those, the Member States found a compromise in a meeting before the end of the year. To limit excessive gas price spikes, the EUâ€™s energy ministers agreed on a cap for the wholesale price of gas under certain conditions. According to a press release, the measure will come into force as of February 15, 2023.After the meeting, its chair negotiator, Czech Industry Minister Jozef SÃ­kela, announced that the agreement unblocked other legislation aimed at tackling the consequences of Russia strongly decreasing its energy exports to the bloc.Slovenia, however, expects the bloc to come up with effective and sustainable solutions for overcoming the crisis by capping market prices of gas and electricity, and securing energy supplies for winter. Bulgaria, too, has expectations of the EU when it comes to regulating energy prices. The energy crisis, inflation and economic recession will continue to be a focus of the EU in 2023.EUâ€™s answer to the US Inflation Reduction ActFor Belgium, one of the most important issues for the beginning of 2023 will be the response to the US Inflation Reduction Act and the relaxation of state aid rules. These measures were announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She said on December 14 that in January the Commission would propose new, simple rules to subsidize green technology in the European Union.This comes as a response to Washingtonâ€™s recent landmark bill called the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). â€œWe need to give our answer, our European IRA,â€ von der Leyen said.The US legislation grants tax credits to US consumers who purchase electric vehicles with batteries manufactured domestically and in certain countries that have free trade agreements with the United States. The EU and the US are major trading partners, but have no such deal.The European Union has criticized the US subsidies of 369 billion dollars to promote climate-friendly technologies, fearing the erosion of the blocâ€™s industrial base with manufacturers relocating to the US. A joint EU-US taskforce set up to resolve these issues has not succeeded so far.Belgium insists that the answer has to be a joint European one. As the country with the highest budget deficit in the European Union, Belgium does not have the firepower to enter into a subsidy race. The announcement of massive German subsidies to soften the energy crisis has made the Belgian industry very nervous.MigrationFor Slovenia, illegal migration to the bloc is a key issue which needs to be addressed at the European level. With no immediate solution in sight, Slovenia intends to strengthen cooperation with its neighboring countries through regional initiatives, e. g. with Croatia. As soon as Croatia enters the Schengen zone and the shared border is no longer an external Schengen border, Slovenia expects closer cooperation. The country keeps highlighting that – in light of Austriaâ€™s police checks of the Slovenian border in 2022 – the Schengen system should become fully operational.As the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex announced, some 308,000 people crossed the EUâ€™s external borders irregularly in the first 11 months of 2022. This is an increase of 68% compared to the same period of 2021 – and the highest level recorded since 2016.The Western Balkans was again â€œthe most active migratory route into the EU,â€ according to the agency, which registered some 140,000 irregular crossings in the region – an increase of 152% compared to 2021.As a country with an enormous pressure on its asylum system, Belgium is also expected to keep urging for more solidarity at the EU level, the conclusion of the new European migration pact and respect for the Dublin rules until that new pact is in place.Under EU law, the country where a migrant first arrives is in charge of hosting the person and of handling asylum requests, a policy often leading to frictions between member countries.Alleged corruption in the EU parliamentAnother topic that is likely to dominate the EUâ€™s agenda in 2023 has emerged in mid-December 2022. Following the Belgian Prosecutorâ€™s Officeâ€™s accusations of participation in a criminal organization, money laundering, and corruption, the then EU parliamentâ€™s Vice-President Eva Kaili and three other suspects were arrested. The four suspects are accused of having influenced decisions in the European Parliament in favor of Football World Cup host Qatar, in return for money and gifts.European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said on December 15 that she will spearhead reforms of the EU legislature herself. â€œI am putting together a wide-ranging reform package to be ready in the new year,â€ Metsola said in Brussels. â€œI will lead this work personally,â€ she added.Metsola also announced a â€œcomplete and in-depthâ€ investigation into how the parliament interacts with countries outside of the EU. Enforcement of the EU Parliament code of conduct policies is to be reviewed. â€œThere will be no impunity, there will be no sweeping under the carpet, and there will be no business as usual,â€ Metsola said.Spanish Presidency in the second halfIn July 2023, the Spanish Presidency will take over the baton from Sweden for the rest of the year. Apart from the general elections in the second half of 2023, it will be one of the great challenges the country on the Iberian Peninsula will face next year.It will be the fifth time that Spain has assumed this responsibility and the last presidency was 13 years ago. The country is expected to take advantage of its term to increase the EUâ€™s focus on two crucial regions: Latin America and the Southern Neighborhood. A summit of the EU with the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) is planned in Brussels. Such a meeting has not been held since 2015. In addition, there are plans for a ministerial meeting in Barcelona with representatives of the EUâ€™s Southern Neighborhood, the southern Mediterranean states.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: ExxonMobil takes legal steps against EU windfall tax, Kosovo asks EU to help resolving tensions with Serbia, and Russia bans oil exports to countries complying with price cap","American group ExxonMobil has filed a claim with the EU court against the windfall tax for energy suppliers. Kosovo has asked the EU to help in resolving questions with Serbia, and Russia forbids export of oil to countries complying with price ceilings.ExxonMobil wants to block the taxation of â€œexcess profitsâ€ of energy giants in EuropeNew York (AFP) – American energy group ExxonMobil appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on Wednesday against the windfall tax for energy giants planned by Brussels, which according to the company could â€œdiscourage investment.â€Adopted at the end of September and officially called the â€œtemporary solidarity contributionâ€, this charge is supposed to be paid by oil, gas and coal producers and distributors who have made huge profits thanks to the price spikes following the start of the war in Ukraine.The system allows EU states to collect 33% of taxable profits for 2022 if they are more than 20% higher than the average of the years 2019-21. This money is then meant to be redistributed to households and businesses faced with soaring bills.When the European Commission proposed the measure, they were careful not to use the word â€œtaxâ€, as any new tax provision at the European level would have required the unanimity of the 27 Member States. (December 28)Kosovo asks the EU for help to resolve tensions with SerbiaMadrid (Europapress) â€” The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo has asked the member countries of the European Union to take measures against Serbia to assist in the peaceful resolution of tensions in the northern part of Kosovo. Kosovo became unilaterally independent from Serbia in 2008.In a letter, the ministry points out the need for Serbia to return to dialogue and reviews the latest incidents. These include the erection of barricades by the Serbian minority in the city of Mitrovica in northern Kosovo and attacks on journalists from Kosovar media.Meanwhile, the EU and the United States have demanded that the parties contribute to calming the situation and to refrain from â€œprovocations, threats and intimidation.â€Tension increased in the area when Kosovo Serb communities blocked the main border crossing between the two countries in Merdare. Afterwards, the Kosovar authorities closed traffic in Merdare, and other points continued to be blocked by barricades. The barricades would be removed, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic announced after meeting with the Serbian minority in Kosovo. (December 28/29)Russia bans oil exports to countries that comply with price ceilingsBrussels (Belga) – From February 1 next year, Russia will no longer sell Russian oil to countries that use the price ceiling agreed by the EU, the G7 and Australia in early December. This is stated in a decree signed by President Vladimir Putin.The ban on crude oil exports will take effect on February 1 and will last at least until July. The ban applies to all â€œcontracts that make direct or indirect use of the price ceilingâ€ and â€œat all stages from export to the consumer,â€ the decree states. The ban on exports of derived oil products will take effect at a later date, which is yet to be determined by the Russian government.With the price ceiling, the West wants to force Moscow to sell its oil to third countries at a maximum price of 60 dollars per barrel. If those countries pay more, companies in theEuropean Union, the G7 and Australia are no longer allowed to provide services that enable the transport of this oil. This involves sea transport or cargo trading and insurance.The majority of Western countries had already stopped importing Russian oil when Russia invaded Ukraine. In addition, Russian oil is currently sold for around 60 dollars. The impact of the price ceiling should therefore be rather limited for the time being. The West intends to evaluate the price cap every two months.Russia previously threatened to cut crude oil production by 500,000 to 700,000 barrels per day next year. Those statements caused oil prices to rise last week. Russia produced an average of 10.9 million barrels of oil per day last month, according to information that the Bloomberg financial news agency was able to access. That puts production at its highest level in eight months. (December 27)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Wednesdays and Fridays.

But the claim is misleading.The UK government announced December 15 that, by summer 2024, air travelers will no longer be limited to carrying liquids under 100 ml in their carry-on luggage. Passengers will be permitted to take bottles of up to two liters on board with them.However, this policy change -- reported by The Times newspaper in the UK on November 23 -- has not been announced worldwide.""At present, the UK is the only country to announce it will ease the restrictions on carrying liquids,"" Kalliopi Lazari, senior communications specialist for the International Air Transport Association, told AFP.'Years away'In the US, liquid volume restrictions are still in effect nationwide -- and there is no publicly announced plan to change them.The UK's policy change comes with enhanced X-ray scanning at airport security checkpoints. The machines will rely on computed tomography (CT) technology that produces 3-D images for screening passengers' items.Some airports outside the UK, including Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in The Netherlands, have also rolled out CT technology to ease their liquid carry-on policies at security checkpoints.A Transportation Security Administration (TSA) spokesperson told AFP on December 21 that CT technology is being deployed at airports in the US as well, but that ""we are years away from announcing a change to the current liquids rule.""The spokesperson added: ""Passengers with exceptions, such as people traveling with infants, nursing parents or travelers with medical needs, may carry on liquids exceeding 3.4 ounces. However, TSA requires additional screening to ensure the safety of these liquids. Travelers in this group should notify security of their medically necessary liquids.""Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt told AFP that ""other countries will carefully study the results of the UK,"" but ""even if the UK policy proves to be successful, it is uncertain whether other countries will follow suit.""Liquid carry-on rules were tightened internationally after British authorities in August 2006 foiled an alleged plot to blow up US-bound airliners using explosives smuggled in drinks and other containers.Manon JacobAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout UsFact-checking at AFPMethodologyFact-Checking StylebookTrainingContactSubscription for prosCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2022.

Europe's response to China's COVID surge,"It feels like a dÃ©jÃ  vu. In a time when Covid-19 restrictions have been eased, the EU started the year with a meeting to discuss adopting a joint approach given the surge of infections in China after Beijing reversed its strict zero-Covid policies. Talks did not yield a binding result.China is not keen on being labeled as the world's Covid spreader, but, just as it was three years ago, the lack of transparency about the data on the spread of the disease among its population has led several Western countries to take precautions by imposing swabs on those arriving from China.World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus expressed understanding for countries that have introduced testing requirements for travelers from China. A move that Beijing, fearing international isolation, deemed ""unscientific"" and ""unreasonable"". And, almost forgetting that only a few weeks ago it had applied draconian quarantines in special hotels for anyone arriving in China from abroad, it threatened to retaliate with countermeasures.At their Wednesday meeting, EU member states failed to agree on mandatory testing, but issued a strong recommendation instead. The experts also advised that passengers aboard flights from China should wear either a surgical mask or an FFP2 (N95) mask. The measures are to be reviewed by the middle of the month.Countries pushing for measuresItaly introduced on December 28 as the first country in Europe mandatory coronavirus testing for people entering from China because of the wave of infections there. Meanwhile, Germany, Britain, France, South Korea and the United States joined in imposing stricter health regulations on arrivals from China. Germanyâ€™s Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said on Thursday that German entry regulations would be changed in the short term and that travelers from China would in the future need at least one negative rapid antigen test when entering Germany.Earlier on Thursday, Belgium and Sweden had announced that they were also introducing mandatory Covid testing for travelers from China. Austria announced that it would do this for all flights from China as of next week.Slovenia, which doesn't have direct air connections with China, supports a coordinated approach of EU members in responding to the entry of passengers from China into the EU. ""Slovenia will not do anything on its own, we will stand in solidarity with Europe, just as most European countries will react, so will we,"" said Minister of Health Danijel BeÅ¡iÄ Loredan on Wednesday. Masks on airplanes would be recommended, but not mandatory.Bulgaria, on the other hand, considers it unnecessary at this stage to implement any measures concerning travelers from China. Bulgaria and China do not have any direct flight connections either. For people traveling from and to China, Bulgaria recommends covid vaccination and the use of facial masks.A similar approach is being taken by its neighbor Romania. The countryâ€™s Minister of Health, Alexandru Rafila, said that most infections were mild, and the strains circulating in Europe were similar to those in China. ""I don't think we will return to the situation of the past years, even if the number of cases will increase significantly, because the new forms of the disease, including the strains circulating in China at the moment, are not as serious, they do not pose the same danger in terms of hospitalization as the older forms.""In the Netherlands, there have been no mandatory tests for travelers from China so far. But the Dutch airline KLM is introducing extra coronavirus protection measures on its flights from China. The crew will be provided with FFP2 masks and safety glasses, KLM announced in Amsterdam, according to a report by news agency ANP. Direct contact with passengers during service on board will be kept brief. Trade unions had previously expressed great concern about the safety of KLM employees because of the strong wave of infections in China.New virus variants?The WHO continues to press for more information from the Chinese authorities.Meanwhile, WHO chief Tedros said the coronavirus variant XBB.1.5, which was discovered in the United States October and is more easily transmissible than any of the previously known variants, was a concern across the world.A spokesman for the German Ministry of Health said on Wednesday that ""above all, we are interested in setting up a virus variant monitoring system."" The variants of the coronavirus known from China so far still were the ones also circulating in Germany. ""But of course, we would like to know at an early stage whether anything is changing."" According to the German health ministry spokesman, one issue is wastewater testing at airports. This already exists at Frankfurt Airport and could be expanded, for example, by examining the wastewater of individual aircraft.However, German epidemiologist Klaus StÃ¶hr said that testing travelers from China was not an effective way to curb new virus variants, amid concerns that these may be spreading undetected. ""Monitoring is not such a bad idea, it is certainly interesting from a scientific point of view, but in purely practical terms we would then have to see how this variant behaves in the population,"" said StÃ¶hr, a former head of the WHO's influenza program.""All this takes a certain amount of time and then the variant has already slipped through. Even testing cannot prevent this,"" explained StÃ¶hr. He also added that testing would not detect every infected person. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has criticized the fact that several countries already require negative Covid tests for inbound travelers from China.""It is extremely disappointing to see this knee-jerk reinstatement of measures that have proven ineffective over the last three years,"" IATA chief executive Willie Walsh said in Geneva. According to scientific studies, such measures could at best delay the spread of coronavirus variants by a few days.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Italian democrats to vote for lifting MEPs immunity, EU recommends tests for travelers from China and Facebook mother Meta fined heavily","The Italian democrats are set to vote in favor of lifting immunity of two MEPs over the corruption scandal. In light of the Coronavirus wave in China, the EU recommends mandatory tests Meta was fined 390 million euros because of data breaches. Democratic Party will vote to revoke parliamentary immunity of Cozzolino and TarabellaRome (ANSA) – â€œThe Democratic Party will vote in favor of revoking the immunity of MEPs Andrea Cozzolino and Marc Tarabella,â€ said Brando Benifei, MEP of the Italian Democratic Party. Benifei is also a substitute member of the legal committee of the European Parliament, which will have to evaluate the request for a waiver of immunity. The Belgian judiciary requested the waiver for two MEPs to investigate their possible involvement in Qatargate.Towards the end of last year, four suspects, among them the then Vice-President of the EU parliament Eva Kailli, had been accused by the Belgian authorities of having influenced decisions in the European Parliament in favor of Football World Cup host Qatar, in return for money and gifts.After Tarabella, Cozzolino also said he was ready to renounce his immunity, pointing out his nonparticipation in the incidents. â€œMr. Cozzolino does not intend to invoke parliamentary immunity for political activities he has carried out freely and transparently. He is completely unconnected to the criminal acts for which he is being prosecuted,â€ his lawyers, Federico Conte, Dezio Ferraro and Dimitri De Beco said. The MEP, they added, â€œwill also ask the parliamentary assembly he belongs to, to be heard to answer all questions and offer all the information and clarifications useful for ascertaining the facts.â€ (January 4)Coronavirus wave in China: EU recommends mandatory testing for travelersBrussels (dpa) – Despite a massive wave of coronavirus infections in China, the EU Member States have not been able to agree on a binding test requirement for travelers from the Peopleâ€™s Republic – but strongly recommend this step. As the Swedish Council Presidency announced on Wednesday, following a meeting of health experts from the Member States in Brussels, EU countries are urged to require a negative coronavirus test, no older than 48 hours, for travelers from China heading to Europe before departure. The members also agreed, among other things, to recommend wearing a medical or FFP2 mask aboard the aircraft. The decision is not binding for the individual EU states. The measures are to be reviewed by the middle of the month. (January 4)Data privacy: Renewed heavy penalty in the EU for MetaDublin (AFP) – US enterprise Meta, the parent company of Facebook, received two heavy fines totaling 390 million euros on Wednesday for violating the European General Data Privacy Regulation (GDPR). This comes after two other heavy sanctions last fall.The Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC), which acts on behalf of the EU, said in a statement that Meta had breached â€œobligations in relation to transparencyâ€ and relied on a faulty legal basis â€œfor its processing of usersâ€™ personal data in connection with the delivery of its personalised services (including personalised advertising).â€This sanction follows the adoption of three binding decisions by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB), the European regulator in the sector, in early December.The first two concerned offenses related to the social network Facebook, for which the fine amounts to 210 million euros, and Instagram, another subsidiary of Meta, which was hit with a 180-million-euro-fine.

"Europe in brief: EU car industry under threat, Eurozone energy prices and inflation ease, Bolsonaro supporters invade Brazilian government headquarters","The head of Stellantis Group, Opelâ€™s parent company, calls upon the EU to protect the European car industry from emerging Chinese competition. The EU condemns the invasion of Brazilâ€™s democratic institutions by supporters of former president Bolsonaro. Eurostat announces that gas prices and inflation are slowing down.
Stellantis boss demands better protection of the European car market from Chinese competitionLas Vegas/RÃ¼sselsheim (dpa) – The head of Opelâ€™s parent company Stellantis has called on the EU to better protect the European car industry from emerging Chinese competition. Without EU intervention, European car manufacturers are threatened by similar conditions as the solar panel industry, warned Carlos Tavares. Stellantis is Europeâ€™s second-largest group of carmakers after Volkswagen, with numerous brands such as Peugeot, Fiat and Opel. EU regulation currently results in around 40 percent higher costs in domestic production of electric cars.German manufacturers do much better business in China than the Stellantis Group, which is struggling with sales problems and recently closed a Jeep plant in China. At the Paris Motor Show, French President Emmanuel Macron issued the industrial policy goal of making his country a great car nation again as part of the switch to electric vehicles. In this context, Macron also spoke of re-industrialization and announced government support for domestic manufacturers. (January 6)The EU closes ranks with Lulaâ€™s BrazilBrasilia/Brussels (EFE) - Brazilian authorities are assessing the damage caused when supporters of former president Jair Bolsonaro invaded the headquarters of the three branches of government in Brasilia on Sunday. They are continuing work to arrest those responsible for the attacks on democratic institutions, perpetrated by Bolsonaro's supporters. The attacks were condemned in the strongest terms by the European Union and the international community that supports President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva.On Sunday, thousands of Bolsonaro's supporters invaded the National Congress building as well as the Planalto Palace, the seat of government, and the Supreme Court building in the Brazilian capital. Control was later regained by security forces. At least 300 people were detained for these attacks, which Bolsonaro tepidly condemned on his social networks. Another 1,200 of Bolsonaroâ€™s supporters were detained in the camp that they had set up in front of the Army headquarters in Brasilia since the October elections.On behalf of the EU-27, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell reminded Brazilian political leaders, and especially ex-President Bolsonaro, that they ""need to act responsibly and urge their supporters to go home. The place to resolve political differences is within Brazil's democratic institutions and not through violence on the streets.""

The increase in consumer prices fell below the symbolic 10-percent-mark for the first time since October, when it reached a record 10.6 percent, after a year and a half of uninterrupted increases.Driven by gas, oil and electricity prices, and to a lesser extent by food prices, inflation worsened from spring 2022 with market disruptions linked to the war in Ukraine.

"Europe in brief: Metsola presents corruption reforms, NATO and EU pledge support for Ukraine, European Commission warns TikTok boss","European Parliament President Roberta Metsola presented a 14-point reform proposal to prevent another corruption scandal within the Parliament. NATO and the EU reaffirmed their defense cooperation by signing a new declaration. The European Commission urged TikTokâ€™s boss to comply with European privacy and data protection rules. A European citizens' initiative to ban the shark fin trade in the EU has collected more than a million signatures.Metsola wants swift reforms for more transparency in the EU ParliamentBrussels (dpa) – After the corruption scandal surrounding the EU Parliament, President Roberta Metsola wants to regain citizensâ€™ lost trust with more transparency and stricter lobbying rules. To this end, she submitted a proposal to the heads of the parliamentary groups on Thursday, containing 14 measures that would make it more difficult to influence MEPs.Among other things, stricter rules are planned for former MEPs who want to lobby in the European Parliament. As long as they receive the transitional allowance to which they are entitled after their mandate, they should not be allowed to be listed in the transparency register and thus would not be able to lobby in Parliament, according to a draft of the Metsola proposals obtained by dpa ahead of the submission.Further proposals are to make public all meetings of MEPs with third parties that are related to a report or a resolution, to require more detailed information on financial interests including secondary occupations of MEPs and to ban so-called friendship groups. In these groups, MEPs maintain informal relations with certain countries – but sometimes use the reputation of the parliament to do so. Instead, third countries should maintain relations with parliament through the Foreign Affairs Committee or official delegations.In addition, according to the plans, all visitors should be registered when entering parliament buildings, including representatives of third countries. The reason for the visit will also have to be stated. Former members of parliament should no longer have a permanent access pass. (January 11)NATO and EU sign third declaration of cooperationBrussels (ANSA) – In Brussels, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel signed the third declaration on EU-NATO cooperation to strengthen and extend cooperation. Key points of the declaration included full support for â€œUkraineâ€™s inherent right to self-defense and to choose its own destiny.â€""Persistent conflict, fragility and instability in our European neighborhood undermine our security and provide fertile ground for strategic competitors, as well as terrorist groups, to gain influence, destabilize societies and pose a threat to our security,"" reads point six of the document, which also addresses Beijing's role. ""We live in an era of growing strategic competition. Chinaâ€™s growing assertiveness and policies present challenges that we need to address,â€ the EU and NATO emphasize.The document extends the areas in which cooperation will be developed in the coming months. The declaration signed at the Alliance headquarters also underlines the complementarity of European strategic autonomy to NATO. ""As underlined by both the NATO Strategic Concept and the EU Strategic Compass, this is a key juncture for Euro-Atlantic security and stability, more than ever demonstrating the importance of the transatlantic bond, calling for closer EU-NATO cooperation,â€ the document states. (January 10)European Commission urges TikTok to respect privacy rulesBrussels (Belga) – The European Commission has urged the boss of social media platform TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, to respect European law. According to a European Commission read-out, Commission Vice-President for Transparency and Values VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ questioned Chew about concerns surrounding personal data protection, child safety, the spread of Russian disinformation and transparency on paid political content.TikTok has long been in the crosshairs of European authorities. The Irish privacy regulator is already investigating the video-platform for possible violations of European GDPR rules on the processing of personal data and illegal transfers to China. Moreover, with the entry into force of the European Digital Services Act (DSA), online platforms will soon face a new range of obligations, including on disinformation.Jourova appreciated that TikTok had signed the new code of conduct on disinformation and implemented European sanctions against Russian propaganda channels. According to the read-out, the video app acknowledges that foreign governments try to manipulate content on its platform. TikTok will also soon report to the Commission under the code of conduct on its efforts in this regard.

Social inequality in Europe,"2022 has been a rough year for many. The economy was still recovering from the pandemic and the restrictions that came with it. Russia waged war against Ukraine and the European continent faced high inflation rates. Despite stable unemployment rates in the EU, the situation does not look rosy for young Europeans.According to Eurostat data released on Monday, the unemployment rate in the eurozone remained stable at 6.5 percent of the labor force in November of 2022, after it had reached its lowest level ever in October. Year-on-year, the unemployment rate declined by 0.6 percentage points, thanks to the post-Covid economic recovery.The indicator has reached its lowest levels since the European statistics office began compiling the series in April of 1998. Eurostat data are based on the International Labour Office (ILO) definition of unemployment. Unemployed persons are defined as those who have actively sought work in the previous four weeks and are available to start work in the next two weeks.For the European Union as a whole, the unemployment rate amounted to 6 percent, also stable over a month and at a record low.While the sharp downturn in growth, caused by the war in Ukraine, and soaring inflation cloud the outlook for the coming months, this has not yet had an impact on employment figures.However, young people continue to be particularly affected: The unemployment rate for those under 25 years of age reached 15.1 percent last November in both the EU and the eurozone, up 0.1 percentage points from October 2022.Highest EU youth unemployment in SpainThis trend is particularly apparent in Spain. The countryâ€™s labor market ended 2022 with the lowest unemployment figure since 2007. 2.83 million people were unemployed. In 2022 a labor reform came into force that limited temporary work contracts and led to an increase of more than 4.9 million permanent contracts compared to 2021.However, the most striking aspect of the Spanish labor market is the youth unemployment figure, which according to the latest data published by the EU statistics office, Eurostat, stood at 32.3 percent in November, making it the highest in the European Union (EU).Brain drain in Bosnia and HerzegovinaIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, youth unemployment is one of the most pressing issues.It has reached a peak of almost 40 percent. Research has shown that the impossibility of inability finding a job is the main reason why young people are leaving Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in droves. According to The Economist magazine, BiH is at the top of the list with the greatest brain drain, and the fact that as many as 51.3 percent of young people still residing in the country are interested in leaving BiH is worrying.There are numerous reasons for this. One is the fact that the country went through a less than successful economic transition process. Another issue is an inadequate education system that has not been modernized, as well as low incomes. Data also indicates that the most common reasons for leaving are the unstable political situation in the country and the belief in greater chances elsewhere.Difficult living conditions despite work for Europeâ€™s youthBut even in countries where youth unemployment is declining, living conditions can be difficult for young people. In Slovenia, the number of unemployed people declined by nearly a fifth year-on-year dropped in December. A total of 53,181 unemployed persons were registered with the employment service. This number includes young people (aged 19-25), who accounted for around 20 percent, a decrease of 18.7 percent year-on-year. Employment services estimate that Slovenia has a record low unemployment rate for those under the age of 29. Only a few years ago, more than 40,000 young people were unemployed.However, the agency notes that the young often enter the labor market without appropriate skills and blames this on the education system. The youth trade union Mladi Plus warns of the hidden unemployment of young people who are not included in the records, but often have precarious jobs.In Bulgaria, youth unemployment dropped significantly from 18 percent in September 2021.  According to Eurostat data, the rate amounted to  10.9 percent in November 2022, just over 4 percent below the EUâ€™s average. However, the share of young Bulgarians working in the shadow economy is twice as high as in their parentsâ€™ generation, according to a nationwide representative survey on Bulgarians' tolerance for unregulated economic practices, conducted in 2022 by the Institute of Philosophy and Sociology (IPS) in collaboration with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.Poor despite workItaly faces inequality over different wage types. The spread of non-standard forms of work has contributed to a deterioration in the overall quality of employment, which in turn leads to lower average wage levels. The combination of low hourly wages and short-term employment contracts results in sharply reduced annual wage levels.According to the Italian National Institute of Statistics annual report 2022, about 4 million employees in the private sector (excluding agricultural and domestic work) are low-paid low wages. This means they have a gross annual income of less than 12,000 euros. About 1.3 million employees receive low hourly wages of less than 8.41 euros. For 1 million employees, the two elements come together. These are mainly young people under 34 years of age, women and foreigners, with low educational qualifications, residing in the South and employed in the service sector.Germany faces shortage of skilled workersAfter a year marked by the pandemic, the war, inflation and the energy crisis, Germanyâ€™s unemployment rate has remained stable overall, despite a seasonal uptick in December, an official said on January 3rd.In November 2022, Germany has the lowest youth unemployment rate in the EU at 5.8 percent, Eurostat data reveals. The country sees its greatest challenges for 2023 in the shortage of skilled workers.Federal Employment Agency chief Andrea Nahles predicted further uncertainty for 2023, noting the shortage of skilled workers. She said one of the aims for the year ahead would be to improve Germany's dual training system, after there had been a lull due to Covid-19.In Germany, vocational training in the dual system means that trainees divide their time between education at a vocational school and training at a company. Nahles also said that further key measures to mitigate the shortage of qualified professionals would be the attraction of skilled immigrants and the qualification and further training of employees and those unemployed.This article is published Fridays.

False posts misrepresenting German study claim gargling with salt water kills coronavirus,"Multiple social media posts falsely claim German researchers have confirmed gargling with salt water kills the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. But AFP found no such study. A scientist who led a similar study in 2020 -- which found certain commercial mouthwashes could reduce the risk of virus transmission -- said mouthwashes are ineffective in treating Covid-19. There is no scientific evidence that salt water gargling can prevent or treat Covid-19, according to health experts.""Try gargling with a mild salt water solution. German scientists conducted experiments on coronaviruses in the throat to demonstrate that gargling with salt water completely alkalizes the throat, creating a hostile environment for the virus that makes its survival difficult,"" reads a claim in Chinese shared here on Twitter on December 14, 2022.An accompanying 58-second clip showing stock videos of medical professionals working in a lab and sanitising streets and buildings has been viewed more than 2,000 times.Simplified Chinese text superimposed on the video reads: ""German-style preventive measures end Covid-19.""At the video's 35-second mark, the Mandarin voiceover can be heard saying: ""German scientists have assured the German Ministry of Health that if every German gargled daily with mild salt water, Covid would be eradicated within a week.""A screenshot of the false tweet, taken on January 11, 2023The claim began to circulate online after China abandoned its zero-Covid strategy on December 7.The surge of Covid-19 cases that followed overwhelmed hospitals across the country, sparked a run on supplies and medicines, and fuelled the spread of misinformation about the disease.AFP has previously debunked a claim that taking showers would worsen Covid-19 infections here.Similar videos with the same claim have been viewed more than 80,000 times on Twitter here; Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, here, here and here; Chinese social media platform Weibo here, here and here; and Chinese video sharing platform Xigua here.Comments on the posts suggest that some users took the claim as genuine advice against Covid-19.""After I stockpiled medications, now it's time to rush to buy salt again,"" one user wrote.""Hurry up to stock up on salt,"" said another.However, the claim is false.German studyAFP found no research conducted by German scientists indicating that gargling with salt water would eradicate the coronavirus.Instead, keyword searches on Google found a similar study published by Ruhr University Bochum on August 10, 2022, which concluded that certain commercially available mouthwashes can reduce the risk of coronavirus transmission.At that time, Toni Meister, the lead author of the study said that mouthwashes are not suitable for treating Covid-19.The study made no mention of the saline solution.Eike Steinmann, head of the Ruhr University Bochum's Department of Molecular and Medical Virology, said there is ""no scientific evidence for therapeutic and preventive effects of gargling salt water.""""Salt water doesn't have antiviral effects.

"Europe in brief: Commissioner Hahn hopeful about Schengen accessions, Commission set to review EU state aid rules, first-ever satellite launch site on mainland EU territory","Commissioner Hahn is hopeful about Romaniaâ€™s and Bulgariaâ€™s chances to join the Schengen zone. European Commission officials consider easing EU state aid rules in response to US subsidies. As of last week, Sweden is home to the EUâ€™s first-ever satellite launch site on mainland territory. Illegal entries into the EU are reaching peak levels not seen since 2016. Hahn: Expect accessions ""in the foreseeable futureâ€Vienna (APA) – Following Austria's veto of Romania and Bulgaria, EU Budget Commissioner Johannes Hahn expects that ""in the foreseeable future, both countries will be able to become members of Schengen."" On Sunday, Hahn told Austrian public broadcaster ORF that a first step could be taken in the area of flights. He was ""not happy"" with Austria's veto, Hahn said. But he had ""a certain understanding"", if 80,000 unregistered migrants came to Austria.The pressure from Austria had already led to a special EU summit on migration in February, the EU Commissioner said. Austria had rightly drawn attention to an issue here. He also understood the frustration of smaller and medium-sized EU states when their concerns were not dealt with immediately, as would happen if, for example, France or Italy voiced concerns.In the future, it must be ensured that EU candidate countries develop 100 percent the same rules as the EU with regard to visa policy, said the former EU Enlargement Commissioner and Ã–VP (Peopleâ€™s Party) politician with regard to illegal migration via Serbia. There must also be clarity about the figures, as there are contradictions between the data provided by the Austrian authorities and those at the European level. Austria's reputation in Romania and Bulgaria was ""definitely damaged by the veto, but that can be repaired.â€With regard to the EU's continued support for Ukraine, Hahn said that this was valid ""without ifs and buts."" The EU commissioner apparently does not expect a peaceful solution any time soon. ""Unfortunately, there will only be a solution on a military level."" He said the EU had the claim and the obligation to help Ukraine, with current operations, reconstruction and arms supplies. (January 15)Uphill road in the EU for state aid and subsidiesKiruna (ANSA) – It is an uphill road and one that risks dividing Europe in its response to the more than 360 billion dollars in subsidies envisaged by the United States with the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has launched a consultation with the member states on the action to be taken, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, at the start of the Swedish presidency of the EU Council, emphasized the need to be quick in taking decisions.We need â€œtargeted and temporary changes to our state aid framework,"" noted the president of the EU executive. She acknowledged, however, that this recipe did not suit all countries. And that was why, according to von der Leyen, financial instruments had to be put in place to also support the investments needed to move forward and accelerate the green transition. This strategy is supported by countries like France and Italy as well as European Commissioners Paolo Gentiloni and Thierry Breton. But it risks alienating a minority of countries – the so-called 'frugal' ones – who are opposed in principle to putting new financial resources on the table and do not want to hear about new common debt.This group of frugal countries can now count on the Swedish EU Council Presidency, which has in recent days repeatedly emphasized the need to adopt a more long-term strategy. The issue is destined to be at the center of confrontation between the EU-27 in the coming weeks, as Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson is determined to make the relaunch of the EU's competitiveness the focus of the European summit to be held in Brussels on 9 and 10 February. (January 13)First satellite launch site opened on the EU mainlandKiruna (dpa) – In the future, the EU will be able to send satellites into space from continental European territory. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, together with Sweden's King Carl XVI Gustaf and Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, opened a new launch site for this purpose in the northern Swedish Esrange Space Center on Friday, to complement Franceâ€™s EU spaceport near Kourou, French Guiana, in South America.On the road to greater independence from Russia, major importance is attached to the complex near Kiruna. ""The current geopolitical situation – not least, of course, the Russian invasion of Ukraine – has demonstrated how important it is that the European Union has access to space,"" Kristersson said at the inauguration. There, together with the king and the Commission President, he symbolically cut a ribbon in the colors blue and yellow. Fittingly, these are not only the Swedish national colors, but also those of Ukraine.""It is a big moment for Europe. It is a big moment for Europeâ€™s space industry,"" said von der Leyen. The spaceport offers independent European access to space and provides exactly the infrastructure that is needed, she added. On the one hand, smaller satellites are to be launched into space from the sparsely populated and heavily forested northern part of Sweden, and on the other, reusable rockets are to be tested there. The first satellite launch is currently planned for the end of 2023. (January 13)Number of illegal entries into EU at highest level since 2016Warsaw (Belga) – The number of illegal entries into the European Union in 2022 is up 64 percent compared to the previous year. It has now reached its highest level since 2016. Some 330,000 people entered and registered in the EU, 45 percent of them through the Western Balkan route. The European border security agency Frontex announced this on Friday.""This is the second year in a row with a steep rise in the number of irregular entries,"" Frontex stated in a press release. ""Syrians, Afghans and Tunisians together accounted for 47% of the detections in 2022."" For Syrians, the figure was 94,000, double that of the previous year.Through the Western Balkan route, 145,600 people were registered, up 136 percent from 2021. Via the Mediterranean route, 100,000 people arrived illegally in Europe. Here, there was a 50 percent increase.About one in ten illegal entrants is a woman and about nine percent of cases involve minors.Frontex also counted 13 million fleeing Ukrainians who entered the EU through Ukrainian borders or via Moldova. Meanwhile, ten million Ukrainians made the reverse move and returned to their country. (January 13)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Corruption scandal: Reforms and ongoing investigations,"The corruption probe attracts ongoing attention to the EU Parliament, which is trying to restore public trust with a series of reforms. At the same time, criminal investigations continue.In December 2022, the then-vice-president of the EU Parliament, Eva Kaili, as well as former EU lawmaker  Pier Antonio Panzeri and two other suspects were arrested by the Belgian authorities on suspicion of participation in a criminal organization, money laundering and corruption. According to the Belgian prosecutorâ€™s office, the suspects are accused of having influenced decisions in the European Parliament in favor of football World Cup host Qatar in return for money and gifts. As things are still unfolding, the EU Parliament is looking into reforms to guarantee the transparency and accountability of its members.Reforms for more transparencyThis week, EU Parliament President Roberta Metsola presented a first set of anti-corruption reforms in Strasbourg. Metsola promised to ensure ""more transparency"" and ""accountability"" with a ""first-step approach"" that would include greater scrutiny of ""those representing third countries and their interests.â€The Christian Democrat politician plans to introduce a so-called ""cooling-off periodâ€, during which former EU legislators may not register to lobby after the termination of their mandate. Among other things, measures will also include improved accountability and checks of lobbyists as well as better controls of access to the parliament's premises.Parliament sources previously said that some proposals of the reforms could be implemented within the next few weeks if there was political support.The Green Party already announced that the proposals do not go far enough and demanded, for example, the publication of penalties for parliamentarians who do not comply with guidelines and rules. The conservative ECR group said it was absolutely clear that the parliament could not continue in this way and welcomed the proposals. The Social Democrats, who were particularly affected by the scandal, also agreed in principle.Further consequencesIn this weekâ€™s plenary session, the EU Parliament has voted for Marc Angel to become one of its 14 vice-presidents. The socialist lawmaker from Luxembourg replaces Eva Kaili, who was stripped of her office after the suspicions emerged. Angel obtained 307 votes, exceeding the 296 votes required for an absolute majority, from fellow legislators in the second round of voting at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France, on Wednesday.In the aftermath of the corruption allegations, all work involving Qatar has been suspended in the European Parliament. This includes all action on legislative files related to Qatar, including visa liberalization and the EU-Qatar aviation agreement, as well as any planned visits.However, the scandal is still unfolding. The immunity of two further members of the European Parliament, who are under investigation in a corruption scandal linked to Qatar, is to be suspended.Belgian authorities requested the waiving of immunity for two Socialist and Democrats lawmakers, Belgian Marc Tarabella and Italian Andrea Cozzolino, Metsola said on January 16. The request was now being dealt with by the parliament's legal committee, she added. The parliamentary president previously said that she expected the final decision to be taken at the next plenary session on February 13.Criminal investigationsIn the meantime Pier Antonio Panzeri, a former EU lawmaker entangled in the corruption investigation in the European Parliament, has signed a cooperation agreement, Belgium's state prosecutor said in a statement on January 17.Panzeri is to make ""substantial, revealing, truthful and complete statements"" with regards to the corruption probe linked to Qatar, including his own involvement and that of other participants, the statement read.The former EU lawmaker is to give details about the financial arrangements with other countries involved, the financial structures set up, and ""the identity of the persons he admits to having bribed."" In return, Panzeri receives a limited sentence, including imprisonment, a fine and the confiscation of all assets acquired in relation to the alleged deed. According to his lawyer, Panzeri is to receive a five-year sentence, most of which will be suspended, as he told Belgian TV station RTL on January 18. In the beginning of the week, an Italian court in Brescia approved a request by Belgian prosecutors to extradite Panzeriâ€™s daughter in relation to the so-called Qatargate scandal. The request for the extradition of Panzeriâ€™s wife had already been approved. The two cases will now be brought to the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation.Italian Prime Minister Meloni: No â€œItalian Jobâ€The corruption scandal has sent shockwaves through Europe. At the year-end press conference in December, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni stated: â€œOne thing really annoys me: Many international colleagues define these events as an â€˜Italian Jobâ€™, as if it was a stain on our nation,â€ she said. â€œThe affair does not only concern Italians, but also Belgians, Greeks and people from other nations. If anything, it is a party issue, a socialist job,â€ the far-right politician added. The Spanish president of the group of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, Iratxe GarcÃ­a, called for the full weight of the law to be brought down on those involved, because they had committed ""crimes of which they were aware."" She said that all MEPs in her political family were disappointed.  In December, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, the Spanish Prime Minister and Social Democrat, described the corruption allegations as a case of ""extraordinary gravity."" He also said that complete trust had to be placed in the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, and the Belgian justice system.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Luxembourg MEP elected new European Parliament Vice-President, all eyes on Scholz's battle tanks, Russian 'tourists' enter BiH","The European Parliament designates a new Vice-President to replace Eva Kaili, who remains in jail. The Parliament also urges German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to clear the way for the delivery of Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. Although numbers are declining, Russian citizens use BiHâ€™s visa-free regime with Russia to enter the EU.European Parliament:  Luxembourg MEP elected vice-president in place of imprisoned Eva KailiStrasbourg (AFP) – On Wednesday, the European Parliament elected a Luxembourg socialist to replace Greek MEP Eva Kaili, who has been jailed for alleged corruption, as vice-president of the institution.The European Parliament has 14 vice-presidents, to whom President Roberta Metsola delegates certain tasks and who can chair debates and voting sessions. A few days after her imprisonment in Belgium, Kaili was stripped of her vice-presidential functions by the European Parliament and excluded from the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D group).In a secret ballot held in the hemicycle of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Marc Angel, 59, MEP since 2019 (S&D group, left), was appointed vice-president by an absolute majority of 307 votes in the second round.Angel, a long-time member of the Luxembourg Parliament, competed against Annalisa Tardino, an MEP from Italy's Lega party (far-right ID group), who obtained 185 votes, and French Green Gwendoline Delbos-Corfield (98 votes). (18 January)European Parliament puts Scholz under pressure in battle tank debateStrasbourg/Berlin (dpa) – The European Parliament has called on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to clear the way for the delivery of Leopard battle tanks to Ukraine. According to a motion adopted by a large majority in Strasbourg on Wednesday, the chancellor should set up a consortium of countries that can provide such tanks â€œwithout further delay.â€ Shortly before the West is going to discuss further military aid on Friday in the German town of Ramstein, the pressure on Scholz to take a decision thus increased further.NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expects the Ramstein meeting to send the message that Ukraine will get â€œmore support and more advanced support, heavier weapons, and more modern weapons."" It was a fight for the Westâ€™s own values and democracy, Stoltenberg said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj accused the international community of hesitating too long. ""The time the free world uses to think is used by the terrorist state [Russia] to kill,"" Selenskyj said in a video address.Scholz did not yet indicate any tendency in Davos. He pointed out again that Germany, together with Great Britain and after the USA, was already one of the greatest suppliers of weapons to Ukraine, which was attacked by Russia. ""We will continue to be such a big supporter,"" he promised. Germany would supply weapons for as long as necessary. Scholz reiterated that he would only decide on new steps together with Germanyâ€™s allies. He explicitly mentioned the USA and France. He said that the aim was to continue to avoid a war between NATO and Russia.After being sworn in on Thursday, Scholz's new Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was scheduled to meet his US counterpart Lloyd Austin in Berlin. Worldwide, 20 countries have the modern Leopard 2 tanks, which are produced in Germany. The German government must therefore approve any transfer of these tanks – regardless of the country. As a rule, this is stipulated in the purchase contracts. This means that Scholz is at the lever for the delivery of the tanks to Ukraine.The European Parliament's call on Scholz was included in a report on the common security and defense policy upon request by the Greens. The report is not legally binding. However, the fact that a head of government of an EU country is explicitly mentioned by name and asked to do something in such a report is considered exceptional, even more so since the motion was an initiative of the Greens, who are part of the German government coalition headed by Scholz. (January 18)Citizens of the Russian Federation enter BiH as â€˜touristsâ€™SARAJEVO (FENA) – The current influx of citizens from the Russian Federation to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on alleged tourist visits has decreased somewhat compared to the end of last year, Advisor to the Director of Border Police of Bosnia and Herzegovina Svevlad Hoffmann told FENA.Since the beginning of the year, the entry of a total of 366 citizens of the Russian Federation through the airport in Sarajevo has been registered. A smaller number entered through other airports as well as by land.Hoffman said that those Russian citizens were abusing the visa-free regime between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Russian Federation. After landing at the airport, they cited tourist purposes as the reason for their arrival in BiH and showed paid vouchers for hotels. They often had considerable amounts of money.â€œThen, instead of heading to the hotel where they allegedly booked accommodation for their stay, they go towards Velika KladuÅ¡a, with the aim of entering the territory of the Republic of Croatia and thus of the European Union and seeking asylum there,â€ explained Hoffmann. Velika KladuÅ¡a is a town in the north-west of BiH, bordering the EU member state Croatia.It is believed that one of the motives of Russian citizens for taking this path is Croatia's entry into the Schengen zone, because they believe that once they enter the territory of the Republic of Croatia, which has been a member of the Schengen zone since January 1, they can continue their journey to other EU countries unhindered.Towards the end of last year, an increased number of Russian citizens, mostly of Chechen and Dagestan origin, were recorded at the BiH side of the border crossing at Maljevac, trying to enter Croatia. Many of them claimed they were fleeing military mobilization in Russia. (January 18)Von der Leyen outlines plan for green and competitive European industryDavos (Belga) – In Davos on Tuesday, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen offered more insight into the Commission's plan to support the European industry on the path to climate neutrality. With less strict procedures and state aid rules, a new investment fund and an assertive trade policy, von der Leyen aims to keep companies in Europe, which are groaning under high energy prices and are tempted by US and Chinese subsidies.The Green Deal Industrial Plan comprises four pillars. Besides accelerated and simplified procedures for the establishment of new production capacities and a focus on developing new skills for the labor market, von der Leyen wants to increase funding. A temporary relaxation of state aid rules, for which Germany and France are pushing, is in the works, but the Commission President said that state aid was ""only a limited solution, which only a few member states can use.â€To avoid fragmentation of the single market, von der Leyen says European funding is also needed. As part of the multi-year budget review, the Commission will put the creation of a European Sovereignty Fund on the table later this year. How that fund would be financed, she left open, but von der Leyen did acknowledge that the initiative would take time. Therefore, ""we will look at a bridging solution to provide fast and targeted support where it is most needed.â€The Commission is expected to put concrete plans on the table by the end of January. On February 9 and 10, the heads of state and government of the 27 Member States will hold a special summit to discuss industrial policy and European competitiveness.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo commented on von der Leyen's plans during a debate on international trade in Davos on Tuesday. He pointed out that an industrial policy is now at the top of the agenda. Five years ago, this was by no means sexy, the Belgian prime minister said. But such an industrial policy was necessary now because the EU needed to be more self-sufficient in certain areas of strategic importance, he stated. ""For energy, we were too dependent on Russia, for security on the US. And for semiconductors, we have an excellent knowledge center in Belgium, but production is done elsewhere.""Europe should come up with its own industrial plan in response to the US Inflation Reduction Act, De Croo argued. He took a positive stance on the incentives for a green economy in the US in themselves, stating that ""they are now on the right side of the table. But the Commission should avoid the relocation of European companies with its own plan. ""Our plan should not be a copy of the American one, but focus on our own strengths,"" De Croo believes.

Posts link Covid-19 vaccines to 'turbo-cancers' without evidence,"Social media posts claim Covid-19 vaccines have caused a surge in aggressive forms of cancer. This is unproven; experts say available data do not show an increased risk -- and health authorities recommend the shots for cancer patients, whose treatments can leave them immunocompromised and more vulnerable to the coronavirus.""Doctors and Pathologists now reporting on 'TURBO CANCERS' due to damaging impact of ï¸(vaccines) on the immune system,"" says a January 2, 2023 Instagram post.The post includes a clip from an hour-long video titled ""Sudden Death + Turbo Cancer, Canadian Doctors Speak Out.""Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization that was banned from Facebook in 2022 for spreading Covid-19 misinformation, published the recording on Rumble in November 2022. In it, Charles Hoffe, a family doctor from British Columbia, claims he has observed a dramatic uptick in stage-four cancer diagnoses since the rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.""New cancers being diagnosed, the tumors are bigger than ever, they seem to grow very aggressively, spread very aggressively and be very resistant to treatment. So this is being nicknamed 'turbo-cancer,'"" he says in the video. ""Cancer pathologists around the world have noticed this -- that unfortunately now, people who have previous cancers which were in remission are flaring up since their shots because of the damage to their immune system by the Covid shots.""Screenshot of an Instagram post taken January 18, 2023AFP has previously fact-checked Hoffe's claims about Covid-19 vaccines. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia (CPSBC) has cited Hoffe for alleged misconduct, including inaccurate statements about vaccination, and he will face a hearing in February 2023.The clip shared online also features Stephen Malthouse, a family physician from Denman Island, British Columbia whom the CPSBC suspended from practicing medicine in March 2022. Both Malthouse and Hoffe have appeared in other misleading, pandemic-related videos from a series titled ""Canadian Doctors Speak Out.""Oncologists and public health authorities told AFP the doctors' claims about Covid-19 vaccination and cancer are baseless.""There is no evidence in Canada or globally that vaccination leads to any forms of cancer or that Covid vaccines lead to rapid advancement in cancers,"" British Columbia's Ministry of Health said in a statement emailed January 11. ""There is also no evidence to support Covid vaccines leading to harm to the immune system; on the contrary evidence strongly supports that Covid vaccines produce strong, effective immune responses that protect from serious illness from SARS CoV-2.""AFP has previously debunked social media posts linking the vaccines to cancer, a claim that the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City says is a ""myth.""""None of the vaccines interact with or alter your DNA in any way, and therefore cannot cause cancer,"" the treatment center says on its website.Bruno Quesnel, director of research and innovation at the French National Cancer Institute (INCa), agreed.""There is no credible mechanism that could explain this, there is no biological rationale,"" he told AFP on January 13.Spike proteinUnlike traditional vaccines, Covid-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) shots do not introduce a weakened or inactivated virus to produce antibodies. Instead, they give cells instructions for how to produce the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus.https://www.youtube.com/embed/NGjppkdEYHcSome social media posts claim that spike protein production is the reason for a supposed increase in stage-four cancers, saying it ""disrupts (the) P53 gene, our ability to suppress cancerous mutation.""But David Gorski, co-director of the Michigan Breast Oncology Initiative, said this is not possible.""To cause cancer, long-term inhibition of P53 activity is required (months to years), which the vaccine can't do,"" he told AFP on January 14.Gorski pointed to limited evidence from computer modeling ""that SARS-CoV-2 spike protein can interact with P53,"" but noted that he is ""unaware of any direct biochemical evidence to support this interaction.""The posts also mislead by invoking ""turbo-cancer,"" he said, as the term is not used by oncologists.""I can't recall ever having heard the term 'turbo cancer' before recently,"" Gorski said. ""It does not appear in any paper I could find in PubMed. It's a term made up by anti-vaxxers.""One tweet shared an article focused on a Swedish study that found the spike protein may inhibit DNA repair.The paper was published in 2021 in the journal Viruses, but it was retracted in May 2022 after the lead author said ""improper experimental design"" likely affected the integrity of the data. The study also did not examine the full spike protein.""Statements regarding the effect of the spike protein on the adaptive immunity are misleading as in this article no experiments related to the adaptive immunity were performed, and the full-length spike-based vaccine was not studied,"" the retraction note says.Shots recommendedLarge studies have demonstrated cancer patients are at high risk for Covid-19 complications.BC Cancer is among the Canadian provincial health authorities that strongly recommend vaccination. British Columbia's Ministry of Health told AFP there are cases where a cancer patient can be immunized during the course of treatment, while other situations require vaccination prior to or following treatment.Covid-19 vaccines have undergone extensive safety monitoring around the world. Canadian health officials have not detected a causal link between the shots and cancer.The best available statistics only detail the number of Canadians diagnosed with cancer through 2018, so it is unclear if there has been an uptick in cases during the pandemic. However, British Columbia's Ministry of Health said there are concerns that people may have skipped routine screening when lockdown policies were in place.""The Covid crisis has created a delay and an underuse of screening and this may have led to diseases being screened at a more advanced stage, but we know that vaccination is particularly beneficial to vulnerable populations and in particular to people with cancer,"" said Pierre Saintigny, an oncologist at the Centre Leon Berard, a hospital specializing in cancer in Lyon, France, on January 12.""It is criminal to blame vaccines as a 'booster' of tumors, especially since pharmacovigilance does not show any signals in this direction.""AFP debunked similar claims in French here.

"Europe in brief: Michel proposes Ukraine reconstruction plans, Franco-German leaders revive their friendship, EU-Iran row over condemnation of Revolutionary Guard","The President of the European Council Charles Michel proposes to use money from frozen Russian assets for Ukraineâ€™s reconstruction. Iranâ€™s Intelligence Ministry warns the EU in response to the European Parliamentâ€™s condemnation of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz regenerate the countriesâ€™ political friendship. Use frozen Russian billions for reconstruction of Ukraine, Charles Michel suggestsBrussels (Belga) – European Council President Charles Michel wants to transfer ownership of frozen Russian assets worth some 275 billion euros to Ukraine. The authorities in Kiev could then use that money to rebuild their country, Michel suggested in an interview with business newspaper Financial Times on Monday.The president of the Council of the EU heads of government told the British newspaper he considered this to be ""just and fair."" However, he did stress that it had to be legally feasible. He said he will actively insist on European government leaders to back the plan.The money in question originally belonged to Russia's central bank, but was lodged in the EU. The European Commission has long been looking for ways to use frozen Russian assets for Ukraine. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, for instance, also announced in November of last year that she wanted to ""actively manage"" the money.Brussels argues that the billions do belong to their rightful owner. The money may be returned if sanctions are lifted. However, this will only be decided upon during final peace negotiations, as Russia must contribute to the reconstruction of Ukraine, EU officials argue. (January 23)Iran's intelligence warns EU over its measures against Revolutionary GuardTehran/Strasbourg (EFE) – On Sunday, Iranâ€™s Intelligence Ministry said it reserved the right to take reciprocal measures, should the European Union carry out any act contrary to the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran. It also declared ""full solidarity"" with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as ""the main pillar of the country's defense forces"" and condemned the resolution passed by the European Parliament to designate the group as terrorists, which it described as ""a useless, hasty and reckless action.â€Last week, the EU Parliament passed a resolution calling on the Council of the European Union to consider the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and its subsidiary forces, such as the paramilitary Basij militia and the Quds Force, as a terrorist organization. Parliament also called for sanctions against Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi and their families, as well as the punishment of the Prosecutor General, Mohamad Jafar Montazeri, as responsible for the repression of protests.The demonstrations in question began last September over the death of a young Kurdish woman named Mahsa Amini, but they have evolved and the young men and women who are leading them are calling for an end to the Islamic Republic. The Iranian authorities have responded with a heavy police crackdown that has resulted in almost 500 deaths and nearly 20,000 arrests, according to NGOs based outside Iran. In addition, four protesters were executed, one of them publicly, and at least 17 people have been sentenced to death by hanging.On Monday, EU ministers decided on a fourth round of sanctions since the protests began in September. In total 37 targets – 18 individuals and 19 entities – were hit with an EU asset freeze and travel ban. Altogether, 164 individuals and 31 entities linked to human rights violations in Iran have now been targeted. Among them are people and entities linked to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). (January 23)Scholz and Macron invoke Franco-German friendshipParis (dpa) – After considerable tensions in recent months, Germany and France have reaffirmed the importance of their friendship for the future of Europe on the 60th anniversary of the ElysÃ©e Treaty. During a ceremony at the Sorbonne University in Paris on Sunday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Germany and France were like ""two souls in one breastâ€ to him. ""For a Frenchman to talk about Germany is to talk about a part of himself,"" he told more than 30 ministers from both governments, and around 200 parliamentarians.""The Franco-German engine is a compromise machine""In French, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz thanked the ""French brothers and sisters"" for their friendship. He assessed the differences of opinion between the two countries as normal in such close cooperation. ""The Franco-German engine is a compromise machine – well oiled, but sometimes noisy and marked by hard work,"" Scholz said. ""It is not driven by sweet talk and empty symbolism, but by our firm will to transform controversies and differences of interest into unified action again and again.""The ceremony was combined with a joint cabinet meeting, which produced few concrete results. In it, France and Germany pledged ""unwavering support"" for Ukraine, without mentioning details about specific weapons systems such as battle tanks.At the joint press conference with Macron in the evening, Scholz praised the cooperation on energy issues. A year ago, he said, it would have been inconceivable to cope with a loss of Russian gas supplies without there being an economic crisis. ""But we have succeeded in doing so, with European solidarity."" He pointed out that France helped Germany out with gas, while Germany helped France out with electricity.Series of upsets in recent monthsSince Chancellor Scholz took office a little over a year ago, there had been a series of upsets in Franco-German relations. Last autumn, for example, France disliked German opposition to a European gas price cap and the German government's 200-billion-euro program to cushion the high energy costs. At the time, Macron accused Germany of isolating itself in Europe. The consultations between the two governments, which were actually planned for October, had to be postponed because they could not reach agreement on all points.Most recently, the vote on arms deliveries to Ukraine did not go smoothly. At the beginning of January, Macron pushed ahead with the decision on armored reconnaissance and infantry fighting vehicles, announcing it one day ahead of Scholz and US President Joe Biden.The final declaration of the joint cabinet meeting deals with a broad range of cooperation from defense to transport to climate protection. (January 22)H2Med hydrogen pipeline between Barcelona and Marseille to be extended to GermanyParis (AFP) – The European hydrogen pipeline project H2Med, which aims to develop the use of hydrogen on the continent, will be extended from southwestern European countries to Germany, French President Emmanuel Macron and the Spanish government announced on Sunday.""We have decided to extend the H2Med project, which, thanks to European funding, links Portugal, Spain and France (...), to Germany, which will be a partner in this hydrogen infrastructure strategy,"" said the French president at a joint press conference with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the reconciliation treaty between Paris and Berlin.In Madrid, the Spanish Energy Ministry confirmed Sunday's agreement ""for Germany to join H2Med"", which follows ""discussions between the Spanish, German, French and Portuguese governments, fostered by their deeply European vision.""

Building a European Leopard tank alliance,"In a historic decision on Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz stated that Germany would send several of its Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine and that other countries would also be allowed to export them to the country. While some nations in Europe and beyond have publicly committed to sending tanks to Ukraine, others remain hesitant.On Wednesday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz promised the Ukrainian government in Kiev 14 Leopard 2 tanks from Bundeswehr stocks. Shortly after, US President Joe Biden announced that the USA would deliver 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks.The German government will also issue the necessary export licences for other countries to send the German-made tanks. As Leopard 2s are produced in Germany, the German government must approve any transfer of these tanks – regardless of the country. As a rule, this is stipulated in the purchase contracts. This means that Scholz is at the lever for the delivery of the tanks to Ukraine.Scholzâ€™s move cleared the way for other European nations that operate Leopards to send tanks from their own fleets to Ukraine, further building up the combined-arms arsenal Kiev said it needs to launch counter-offensives.Poland, Finland and the Baltic states had been pushing for tanks to be sent. Currently, at least eleven EU countries as well as Turkey and Norway are in possession of the German-made Leopard 2 tanks. Altogether, they hold over 2,000 of them. Germany, the United States and other allies want to support Ukraine in the war against Russia with significantly more than 100 Western-designed battle tanks.The first Leopard 2 battle tanks from Germany could be in Ukraine in about three months, the German government said. Berlin's goal is to quickly assemble two tank battalions with Leopard 2s, with the addition of tanks from other European countries.Commitments to send Leopard 2 tanks to UkraineAmong the nations which have publicly announced they are ready to send tanks to Ukraine are Poland, Spain, Norway and Finland.Poland had exerted considerable pressure on Germany in the discussion about the battle tank deliveries. The Central European country with a direct border to Ukraine has no less than 247 Leopards, according to its Ministry of Defense. Last week, Polish President Andrzej Duda had already announced that 14 of them would be handed over to Ukraine.Spain said it was ready to send some of its German-made Leopard tanks to support Ukraine's fight against Russia after Berlin granted approval for their European transfers. The Minister of Defense, Margarita Robles, stated on Wednesday that Spain is willing to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine and to train in their use, always in coordination with the allies.Spain has 347 Leopard battle tanks, of which 108 are 2A4 models bought from Germany in the 1990s, the oldest currently in operation. They require an overhaul that would take around a month and a half, according to defence sources, who point out that training the Ukrainian military would require another month. The remaining 239 tanks are so-called 2E models, the Spanish version and one of the most modern.Norway will send Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine as part of Western aid, its Defense Minister BjÃ¸rn Arild Gram said, joining other European countries.  According to the Ministry of Defense, the country purchased 52 used Leopard 2A4s from the Netherlands in 2001, but not all of them were operational.Considering further military aidAs the debate about supplying Ukraine with more efficient military equipment continues to unfold, some European governments remain on the sidelines to carefully consider their next move, while others distanced themselves from the debate.France ""welcomes"" the German green light to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine, saying it ""extends and amplifies"" the arms support to which Paris had committed, the ElysÃ©e Palace said on Wednesday. The French government itself has not yet decided whether to send its own heavy Leclerc tanks, a possibility that President Emmanuel Macron has not ruled out. On January 4, Paris had announced the sending of ""light battle tanks,"" followed by a similar decision by Germany and the United States.On Sunday, President Macron assured that ""nothing is ruled outâ€, but issued three criteria for any potential action: It must not be escalatory, it must provide real and effective support to the Ukrainians, taking into account the time needed for training, and it must not weaken French defense capabilities. In any case, no decision on this subject was expected in the very short term, Paris warned.Italy is not part of the debate about Ukraineâ€™s request to send German Leopard 2 tanks to help fight off the Russian invasion, Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said on Monday at the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. Together with the French the country is now committed to deliver anti-missile defence systems to Ukraine, the foreign minister added.Slovenia does not possess any Leopard 2 tanks, but supports Ukraine in any possible way, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said on the sidelines of the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday. Last autumn, Slovenia sent 28 M55S tanks to Ukraine, which had remained in the country after the withdrawal of Yugoslavian forces in 1991 and were modernized later. This was part of an agreement with Germany on an exchange of military vehicles. Slovenia sent 28 tanks to Ukraine and received 40 German-made transport vehicles in exchange.Croatia is also among the EU members that do not have German Leopard 2 tanks. At the very beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Croatian government approved the delivery of infantry weapons – machine guns, assault rifles, ammunition and protective equipment – with a total value of about 16.5 million euros, enough to arm up to four brigades.Bulgaria mainly has Soviet era military equipment and does not operate Western tanks or fighter jets. The country decided last December to provide military support to Ukraine. Each individual delivery will require parliamentary approval.Bulgaria's Chief of Defense, Admiral Emil Eftimov, said that a specified set of armaments and materiel was proposed on the basis of findings about the progress of hostilities in Ukraine and the condition and capabilities of the Bulgarian defense industry, as well as those of its EU and NATO allies.This article is published Fridays.

"Europe in brief: Johansson rejects Austria's border fence request, Commission approves German labeling plans for livestock farming, Iran sanctions EU and UK","EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson discarded Austriaâ€™s request for EU funds for the extension of the fence along the Bulgarian-Turkish border. The European Commission preliminarily approved German plans to introduce livestock farming labels for meat in supermarkets. Iran sanctioned EU and UK officials and entities, in response to sanctions imposed by the latter on Monday.EU Commissioner: No money for border fencesBrussels (APA) – EU Commissioner Ylva Johansson has rejected Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer's demand for funding to extend the fence on the Bulgarian-Turkish border. There is â€œno money in the EU budget for this, so if we spend money on walls and fences, there will be no money for other things,"" Johansson said before an informal meeting of EU interior ministers in Stockholm on Thursday. Interior Minister Gerhard Karner renewed the demand.Many countries at the external borders needed help, Karner emphasized in view of his recent on-site visit to the Bulgarian-Turkish border. ""I think that many countries would be interested in making this external border protection more robust,"" Karner said. This would require the support of the EU Commission ""in various respects"", for example for technical equipment, but also "" with regard to the fences.â€Nehammer and Karner had traveled to the Bulgarian-Turkish border at the beginning of the week. Austria vetoed the Schengen accession of Bulgaria and Romania in December because of illegal migration. The chancellor called for investments in border protection, a reduction in seizures of unregistered migrants as well as speedy procedures and more readmission agreements. Two billion euros would be necessary to expand the border fence, Nehammer said in Bulgaria. (January 26)Ministry: EU Commission preliminarily agrees to livestock farming labelsBerlin (dpa) – According to its own information, the German Federal Ministry of Agriculture has been given the preliminary green light by Brussels for a planned livestock farming label for meat in supermarkets. ""The EU Commission has examined the draft law for binding livestock farming labels in Germany in principle,"" the ministry announced on Wednesday. The Commission had not expressed any reservations during this procedure. The review is intended to ensure that the regulation complies with EU law and is compatible with the principles of the internal market.The labeling is to be launched for consumers in 2023, starting with fresh pork. The labeling system will assign five categories, depending on how the animal is reared. These will range from compliance with the legal minimum standards in the stable to organic farming. Meat from abroad may be labeled on a voluntary basis. The bill is currently being discussed in the Bundestag, the German parliament. According to the agricultural ministry, if major changes are made, the EU Commission might have to re-examine the bill. (25 January)Iran adopts sanctions against Europeans and UKTehran (AFP) – On Wednesday, Iran retaliated the recent sanctions from the European Union and the United Kingdom by taking reciprocal measures, more than four months after the start of the protest movement sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini.Tehran sanctioned 25 individuals and entities from the European Union, among them ten French citizens, including the mayor of Paris, and nine from the United Kingdom, in retaliation to sanctions imposed by the latter on Monday.The Iranian authorities accuse these persons and entities of ""supporting terrorism and terrorist groups,â€ ofâ€œencouragement to terrorist acts and violence against Iranian people"" or of ""dissemination of false information about Iran,"" the Iranian Foreign Ministry explained.The EU said ""these Iranian measures are purely politically motivated,"" insisting the European sanctions were ""adopted on clear legal grounds"". (January 25)European Parliament seeks to curb political microtargetingBrussels (Belga) – Using citizens' personal data unsolicited to bombard them with tailored political ads? In the run-up to the 2024 European elections, the European Parliament wants to sharply curb such so-called microtargeting.Microtargeting is a technique where advertisers target their message to a specific audience, based on analysis of their personal data. Someone who profiles as a cycling tourist online could thus be shown advertisements for cycling equipment. The UK campaign surrounding the Brexit referendum and the 2016 US presidential elections made it clear that microtargeting has also taken root in politics, and is susceptible to manipulation.""We are going to consign misleading online political ads to the past, by making it impossible to still prey on people's specific weaknesses,"" declared Italian MEP Sandro Gozi after the approval in committee of a draft regulation to make the world of political ads more transparent and fortify democratic systems against disinformation and foreign interference.The text of the draft prohibits the use of certain sensitive personal data, such as ethnic origin, religious affiliation or sexual preference, for targeted political ads, both online and offline. It limits the online use of the technique to four categories of personal data, for which the user has to give explicit consent. The rules will be tightened further in the 60 days prior to elections or referendums, when targeted ads can only be based on location, language and the information that someone is a first-time voter. Microtargeting minors will be banned.""The era of platforms using huge amounts of data unsolicited to influence voting behavior – or, even worse, to pit groups of people against each other – is coming to an end,"" explained Belgian MEP Tom Vandenkendelaere. ""In the future, users will be able to decide for themselves which personalized online political ads they want to receive. This will be an important step forward to protect democracy ahead of the European elections in 2024.""The MEPs also want more information on political ads to be made available to citizens, authorities and journalists. Thus, they are pushing for a new database of political ads and related information. The draft regulation should make it easier to obtain information on who funds a political ad and how much was paid for it and where the money came from. Information should also be published about specific target groups and what personal data was used to target them.MEPs also intend to sanction and potentially ban individuals or organizations from third countries paying for political advertisements in the European Union.

"Europe in brief: Scholz does not want to discuss jets for Ukraine, Petr Pavel wins Czech elections, Baerbock's controversial Russia statement fallout","German Chancellor Olaf Scholz does not wish to engage in a debate about sending fighter jets to Ukraine. According to analysts, the newly elected President of the Czech Republic Petr Pavel promotes close ties with the EU and wants to help Ukraine repel Russiaâ€™s invasion. Following German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbockâ€™s controversial statement regarding the war in Ukraine, the German Federal Government clarifies that the country is no party to the conflict.Scholz wants to close the debate on sending fighter jetsBerlin (HINA) – On Monday, during his visit to Chile, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz rejected the sending of fighter jets to Ukraine and expressed his desire to end the debate.The German chancellor explained that he had already ruled out the possibility of sending fighter jets in a conversation with US President Joe Biden right at the onset of the Russian attack on Ukraine.In a recent interview, Saskia Esken, the president of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) – to which Olaf Scholz also belongs – did not categorically reject the possibility that Germany, after the decision to deliver Leopard 2 tanks, would also deliver combat planes to Ukraine.Scholz, in an interview before leaving for Latin America, assessed that the discussion about which weapons should be delivered to Ukraine currently resembled a race. (January 30)New Czech president more open to EU and UkrainePrague (AFP) – The newly elected Czech President Petr Pavel, a former NATO general, will promote close ties with the EU and help Ukraine stand up to Russia's invasion, analysts told AFP.Pavel won Saturday's presidential election, defeating billionaire populist Andrej Babis. His victory follows the recent Czech EU presidency, which was widely regarded as successful. He succeeds Milos Zeman, who is known for his ties to Moscow and Beijing.""We know that his contacts at NATO, as well as with peers from NATO member states... are very strong, and foreign policy will be his domain,"" said Pavel Havlicek, a scientist at the Association for International Affairs in Prague.""He is very much in favour of Ukraine, he has repeatedly voiced his support, and he's very critical towards Russia,"" said Jiri Pehe, a political analyst at New York University Prague.Pavel's ""firm commitment to European values"" was welcomed by the head of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. ""Your experience in security, defence and foreign relations will be precious to maintain and strengthen Europe's unity in support of Ukraine,"" she added. (January 29)After Baerbock's statement, Federal Government emphasizes: Germany is not party to warBerlin (dpa) – Following a controversial statement by German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, the German government has stressed that Germany is not a party to the war in Ukraine. ""NATO and Germany are not a party in this war of aggression by Russia against Ukraine,"" said deputy government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann in Berlin on 27 January. Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, referring to the recent decision to supply Leopard 2 battle tanks to Ukraine, also stressed that this did not make Germany a party to the war.""We are fighting a war against Russia and not against each other."" With these words Baerbock called for cohesion among Western allies at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg on 24 January.The Russian state media seized on this statement as a key phrase of war propaganda and proof that Germany and the other EU countries were direct parties to the conflict in Ukraine and were fighting against Russia. On January 27, the spokesperson of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, had demanded an explanation from the German ambassador in Moscow on ""contradictory"" statements from Berlin.A Foreign Ministry spokesperson explained in Berlin that the lengthy discussion in which the statement was made had been about emphasizing that the EU, the G7 states and NATO were united against the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine. ""Russian propaganda is always taking statements, sentences, attitudes, positions of the German government, of our partners, and twisting them to serve its purpose,"" the spokesman said. ""The one who is escalating here is Russia."" In the sense of international law, Germany was not a party to the conflict, he added. (January 27)Nehammer and Rutte want to pull together on migrationVienna (APA) – The Netherlands and Austria want to join forces at the special EU summit to call for solutions to mitigate illegal migration. On Thursday, during a visit to Chancellor Karl Nehammer, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said that he saw ""a consensus forming"" in the EU. Nehammer reiterated the demand for financial EU support for Bulgaria and Greece for EU external border protection.However, it would take several EU summits to resolve these issues, Rutte said. When the EU-Turkey refugee deal was concluded in 2016, it was easier, the Dutch prime minister stated. Now, he added, the EU had a plethora of problems, including Schengen, Frontex, the Dublin system and repatriations.""If we want to keep the EU as a safe haven for refugees, we also have to make sure that the numbers are manageable,"" Rutte said. He explained it was clear that more external border management measures were needed. However, Rutte argued one could not dictate to the EU Commission what it had to pay for.Nehammer said that Austria had the same problems as the Netherlands with the transfer of Dublin cases. He accused the EU Commission, which does not want to finance fences, of taking an ""ideological approach"" to this issue. The guidelines for the protection of the EU's external borders also included construction measures. It was ""not okay to leave Bulgaria alone with the costs."" In reality, the Bulgarian border guards were also protecting the borders of Austria and the Netherlands. ""This is not an ideological question, but a pragmatic one,"" Nehammer added. One had to be flexible and creative.Austria blocked the Schengen accession of Bulgaria and Romania in December because of illegal migration. The Netherlands had also expressed reservations about Bulgaria. During a visit to the Bulgarian-Turkish border on Monday, Nehammer demanded EU funds to the tune of 2 billion euros to expand Bulgaria's border fence.Under the Dublin system, the country of first reception would be responsible for asylum procedures, but in practice the system does not work well in the EU.

Biden gun reform speech manipulated to add derogatory heckling,"A video viewed nearly 200,000 times on Instagram appears to show a crowd interrupting US President Joe Biden with an expletive-laden chant during a speech on gun reform. But the clip has been manipulated; the original footage of the address shows Biden reacting as the father of a school shooting victim stood up to call for a greater response to gun violence.""Sit down, you'll hear what I have to say,"" Biden says in the video, as the crowd, unseen in the background, appears to drown him out with jeers of ""Fuck Joe Biden.""The January 23, 2023 Instagram post racked up more than 11,000 likes and 198,000 views in a matter of days. Similar clips have circulated online for months.Screenshot from Instagram taken January 27, 2023But the video has been digitally altered, to layer the chant over footage of Biden's July 11, 2022 remarks in commemoration of the passage of a law aimed at reducing gun violence, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act.Reverse image searches using frames from the edited video and keyword searches based on the words Biden spoke led AFP to the original footage.The original video and White House transcript from the event show that as the president spoke, he was interrupted by Manuel Oliver, whose son was killed in the 2018 mass shooting at Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Oliver's protest made headlines across US media.https://youtu.be/uUomeoCG2xQHowever, Oliver did not chant the anti-Biden slogan. Instead, the father-turned-activist called for more action in response to gun violence in the US and suggested that the White House open a separate office devoted to the issue.""We have to do more than that,"" Oliver shouted, according to the White House transcript.Several US news organizations recorded videos of Oliver as he spoke and was confronted by security agents. Photos of the episode show him acting alone.https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xo5FHXzkM7AOliver later clarified his remarks to ABC News, saying he did not arrive with plans of interrupting the president but became frustrated by the event's celebratory tone given the country's ongoing struggles to stop gun violence and mass shootings. Security escorted him out.""I didn't say F... Biden,"" Oliver said in a January 30 Twitter direct message to AFP. ""I asked him to open an office dedicated to Gun Violence and nothing else. I respect Mr Biden and gave him my vote.""AFP also reached out to the White House, but no response was forthcoming.AFP has previously debunked several other videos that were digitally altered to include anti-Biden chants, including here, here and here.January 30, 2023 This article was updated to add comment from Manuel Oliver.Bill MCCARTHYAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesUS POLITICSFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookTrainingSubscription for prosContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2023.

"Europe in brief: Two MEPs lose their immunity, European Parliament debates border fences, Commission presents Green Deal Industrial Plan","The European Parliament voted in favor of lifting the immunity of MEPs Marc Tarabella and Andrea Cozzolino. While some political groups in the Parliament demand EU funding for fences along the Bulgarian-Turkish border, others reject this. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen unveils details regarding the Green Deal Industrial Plan.Corruption: European Parliament lifts immunity of two MEPsBrussels (AFP) – On Thursday, the European Parliament lifted the immunity of two MEPs targeted by the Belgian judiciary in the scandal over alleged corruption benefiting Qatar and Morocco, paving the way for further inquiry by investigators.Voting by show of hands, MEPs in Brussels gave the green light to the lifting of the immunity of Belgian Marc Tarabella and Italian Andrea Cozzolino.The two MEPs, who were temporarily excluded from the Socialists & Democrats (S&D) group, deny any wrongdoing. Tarabella, who was present in the chamber, voted to lift his own immunity.""It is to the justice system that I will give information on the questions that [the investigators] want to ask me. I want the justice system to do its job,â€ said the Belgian MEP as he left the chamber.From now on, ""everything will be possible, (...) this does not necessarily mean that there will be coercive measures, but the justice system is giving itself all the means to be able to work as it would for any person subject to trial,"" Eric Van Duyse, spokesman for the Belgian federal prosecutor's office, told AFP. (February 2)Calls for funding of border fences in EU parliamentBrussels (BTA) – The European Parliament has debated the issue of migration, with several political groups backing a call to the European Commission to allocate funds for a fence between Bulgaria and Turkey.According to the European People's Party group, fences and walls should no longer be taboo. The Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group takes the opposite view, saying that building walls is supported by the right and the far right, but does not solve the problems.The Renew Europe group demanded immediate easing of the situation at the external borders. The Greens accused Commission President Ursula von der Leyen of proposing a plan to turn Europe into a fortress.The Identity and Democracy group said the Commission's proposals were realistic, because efforts needed to be focused on protecting external borders.The European Conservatives and Reformists slammed the Commission for claiming that there is no money in the European budget for border walls. The left accused the far right of inciting xenophobia over a ""non-existent migration wave."" (February 2)Von der Leyen puts green industry plan on the tableBrussels (Belga) – On Wednesday, the European Commission presented its long-awaited green industry plan. The â€œGreen Deal Industrial Planâ€ is Europe's answer to US billions in subsidies for green industry and against unfair competition from China. In the short term, member states will have the prospect of 250 billion euros in European loans and subsidies, although little new money is included.With its green industry plan, the Commission wants to safeguard the lead that European industry currently has in green technology. Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s proposals are not explicitly directed against other countries or power blocs, but it is no secret that Europe is concerned about its competitiveness and industrial development. In the Commissionâ€™s view, there appear to be well-founded fears that the United States, with its Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), is luring or inducing European companies to invest there, rather than in the EU.The European plan should primarily facilitate investment in and financing of homegrown clean tech. To this end, the Commission is pursuing several avenues. As has been known for some time, it wants to relax state aid rules. That should make it possible for member states to invest money into the production of batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps, electrochemical cells, CO2 capture and storage, and into the raw materials needed to produce such goods. It should also be possible to support the financing of all renewable energy sources.The new state aid framework will already be launched in the coming weeks and remain in force until the end of 2025. In addition, the Commission wants to raise the ceiling for the notification of state aid, known as the â€œblock exemptionâ€. The roll-out of cross-border projects of common European interest involving several countries will be simplified.Because all member states will be able to operate in the same way, the Commission hopes to minimize distortion of the single market in the context of the global subsidy race. But of course, not all member states have the financial capabilities of countries like Germany and France to support their industries. Therefore, access to European support for the green industry will be facilitated. Specifically, member states will be able to set up the new REPowerEU chapter (which allows them to get investment support from the Covid recovery fund) in their national recovery plan in such a way that it allows them to subsidize their green industry. Among other things, the Commission advises them to grant tax credits and other tax breaks, as well as invest into retraining workers for jobs in in clean tech.The Commission is holding out 250 billion euros to member states. Of this, 20 billion euros is new money, made available in the form of grants. The 5.4 billion euros from the fund to mitigate the impact of Brexit could also be used for green investments, the Commission suggests. The remaining 225 billion euros are loans still available under the Covid fund. To unlock European funding quickly – considering that Washington will come up with new guidelines for tapping IRA grants in March – the Commission wants to tap other sources, such as the Innovation Fund. In the medium term, member states should also benefit from a new investment fund – a sovereignty fund, in the Commission's words. When the European multiannual budget is revised in summer, the Commission will announce more details on this.Besides more funding, the green industry will also benefit from a simpler and more predictable regulatory framework, the Commission believes. To this end, it elaborated a 'Net-Zero Industry Act'. Speeding up authorization procedures for industrial projects is one of the main objectives. There will also be a critical raw materials act, to help the EU gain access to strategic raw materials for its industry – for example, lithium.The plan will be discussed at the European Summit of heads of state and government on 9 and 10 February. (February 1)EU to train another 15,000 Ukrainian soldiersBrussels (dpa) – The extent of the current EU training mission for the Ukrainian armed forces is to be doubled. The new target is to train 30,000 Ukrainian soldiers in EU countries, several EU officials said in Brussels on February 1. Previously, the goal had been to train around 15 000 soldiers.The launch of the EU training mission had been decided by the foreign ministers of the Member States in November. At that time, it was said that up to 15,000 Ukrainian soldiers would be trained in Germany, Poland and other EU countries. With this deployment, the EU wants to help Ukrainian troops to better defend themselves against Russian attacks.Within the framework of the EU mission, the German Bundeswehr offers, among other things, combat training for companies as well as tactical exercises for brigade and subordinate battalion staff. In addition, the German offer includes training for trainers, medical training and weapon systems training in close cooperation with industry. According to original plans, Germany wanted to train a brigade of up to 5,000 Ukrainian soldiers in the first few months.

Ahead of special EU summit: Â Commissioner Johansson regards building walls around the EU as â€œnot a good solutionâ€,"With rising migration numbers putting pressure on the EU, the heads of state and government of the Member Countries are expected in Brussels next week to discuss this matter, among others. On Tuesday, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson discussed border walls, the Schengen area, the Dublin Regulation and the new pact on migration with the enr-correspondents.The EU is currently facing high numbers of migrants into the bloc. In an interview on Tuesday, EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson told enr-correspondents that last year saw a â€œsteep increaseâ€, with 330,000 irregular arrivals coming from countries such as Turkey, India, Cuba, Egypt and Morocco.At the same time, nearly 1 million people applied for asylum in the EU, the commissioner said. According to Johansson this was putting pressure on some member states, such as Belgium and the Netherlands.For next weekâ€™s special summit, the EU heads of state are expected in Brussels to discuss some of the open questions surrounding migration into the EU. There are some sticking points likely to play a role.Border fences financed from EU funds?One of the points of debate will probably be the financing of fences from the EU budget. Johansson stated in the interview that the EU was financing border protection, but â€œthat building walls and barbed wires around [the] European Union is not a good solution for many reasons.â€â€œWe have a long-standing principle of not financing walls and barbed wires. And I think that should not be changed. But I also think that we should have a pragmatic approach. Of course the majority of financing for border protection comes from the national budget and we should focus on what we can do best with the EU money,â€ Johansson added.At the same time, the commissioner did not rule out that ""physical infrastructure"" at the external borders could be financed from the EU budget. This could be technology for border surveillance, for example.However, in the fall of 2021, more than ten EU states had already demanded from the EU Commission that physical border barriers should be paid from the common budget, at least in part. Back then, the Brussels authority had firmly rejected this. Most recently, Austria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer demanded 2 billion euros from the Commission for the expansion of the border fence between Bulgaria and Turkey.Schengen and internal border checksIn the free travel Schengen area, there are currently border checks in place between its members, for example on the Austrian-Slovenian border.â€œWe need to get rid of the internal border checks,â€ Johansson said in that regard. The EU Commission was reaching out to the concerned member states and their neighbors in order to find ways to prevent irregular arrivals as well as to protect the countries from security risks without internal border checks, she added.At a meeting with his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte on January 26 in Vienna, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said that the border controls currently in place between Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia showed that the Schengen system of open borders was failing.Enforcement of the Dublin Regulation and SchengenIn her interview with the correspondents, Johansson stressed the importance of a well-functioning Schengen area, which would also include an effective registration of people entering the bloc.â€œI'm concerned about the situation where in Austria, for example, 75% of the irregular arrivals there have not been registered before they turn up in Austria. In the Netherlands it's 90% of the irregular arrivals that turn up there that have not been registered before,â€ she said.The EU's Dublin Regulation provides for migrants to be returned to the country where they first entered the bloc and for their asylum requests to be handled there. The regulation puts great pressure on Greece, Italy, Spain and Malta, due to the high volume of arrivals via the Mediterranean Sea.For years, southern EU states have charged fellow bloc members with a lack of solidarity, as many refuse to take in a fixed share of some of the tens of thousands of migrants that reach the EU each year.At the Vienna meeting on January 26, the Dutch Prime Minister MarkRutte demanded that the registration of migrants at the EU's external borders, as provided for by the Dublin Regulation, should be restored with as few gaps as possible.Access to Schengen areaOn Tuesday, Johansson confirmed that Romania and Bulgaria were fulfilling all criteria to enter the Schengen area. She was confident that there would be a decision on the access of Romania and Bulgaria â€œpretty soon.â€Austria had vetoed Bulgariaâ€™s and Romania's Schengen accession at the end of 2022 because of irregular migration across their external EU borders.New pact on migration and asylumIn Tuesdayâ€™s interview, Commissioner Johansson said that there was â€œa good progressâ€ on the legislative package. Johansson was confident that all aspects of the pact would be â€œdecided during this mandate.â€ The term of the current EU Commission is due to end 2024. At the same time, the Commissioner warned that â€œit will still take some years before everything is implemented.â€In September 2020, the EU Commission had proposed a so-called new â€œPact on Migration and Asylum.â€ This came after it transpired in 2015/2016 that the current system, as well as the mandatory distribution of refugees among the member states, wasnâ€™t working.Another central issue is the repatriation of migrants without the right to stay. EU interior ministers already discussed the topic last week. This debate is likely to continue at the upcoming summit.On January 26, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote a letter to the EU heads of state and government, in which she presented her proposals for short-term success in migration policy. Among other things, she emphasized the protection of external borders, faster repatriations and the complete registration of migrants who reach the EU.This article is published Fridays.

Fake Starbucks CEO quote on 'traditional marriage' resurfaces online,"Social media users claim Starbucks interim chief executive, Howard Schultz, said people should not buy the chain's coffee if they support ""traditional marriage."" But there is no evidence Schultz ever said this, and the company said the quote is made-up.""Starbucks CEO: 'If You Support Traditional Marriage DON'T Buy Our Coffee,'"" says text over an image of Schultz shared January 26, 2023 on Twitter.The claim soon accumulated thousands of interactions.

But there is no evidence Schultz ever said the quote shared online.""This is false,"" Starbucks told AFP in a statement emailed February 2.The posts appear to misconstrue something Schultz -- who led the company as CEO for many years -- said during a 2013 shareholder meeting when analyst and investor Tom Stauber challenged the company's position on same-sex marriage.""Until January a year ago, we existed without making gay marriage a core value of our company,"" Stauber said. ""Hence we did quite well.""He claimed a boycott organized by the National Organization for Marriage, a group that advocates against LGBTQ rights, was partly to blame for ""disappointing"" financial results.Schultz, then CEO, replied: ""It is not an economic decision to me.

"Europe in brief: EU-Ukraine summit aftermath, Franco-German Washington trip, no walls on Bosnia and Herzegovina-Croatian border","EU officials return from a meeting with the Ukrainian government in Kiev, leaving the door open for Ukraineâ€™s accession to the EU. German and French economy ministers embark on a journey to Washington to discuss green subsidies plans with the Biden administration. Croatian president Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ announces that his country will not build barriers of any kind along its border with Bosnia and Herzegovina.Selenskyj: EU accession negotiations can start this yearKiev (dpa) – Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj continues to press for his country's swift accession to the European Union after the summit with EU representatives in Kiev. ""We are already speaking as members of the EU,"" Selenskyj said in his evening video message, broadcast in Kiev on 3 February. The status just needed to be enshrined in law, he stated. However, the European Commission, headed by President Ursula von der Leyen, had stressed that Ukraine still had a long way to go before becoming a member of the European Union.""There is an understanding that it is possible to start negotiations on Ukraine's membership in the European Union this year,"" Selenskyj said. There were no such concrete statements from the EU side. Von der Leyen had praised Selenskyj's determination and will to reform in Kiev, but also stressed that there was still work to be done. There is no timetable.Selenskyj is traditionally euphoric about Ukraine's quick EU membership. ""We are preparing Ukraine for greater integration into the internal market of the EU – that means more income for Ukrainian companies, more production and jobs in our country. And more income for our state and local households,"" he said. ""This is what will really make Ukraine stronger."" Ukraine would do everything to ensure that Russian aggression turned into a ""suicide"" for Moscow, Selenskyj added. Thus, he said, the EU had now also welcomed his plan for peace in Ukraine. The core of Selenskyj's plan is the withdrawal of Russian troops before negotiations begin. Russia, which controls almost 20 percent of Ukraine's territory, rejects this request as absurd.Selenskyj also reported on the visit of Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak. Within the Western tank coalition, everything is being done to ensure that Ukraine receives modern heavy weapons as soon as possible. The tanks should not only help the country to stop the Russian advance, but also to reverse the conquest of occupied territories. Selenskyj admitted that in the face of massive Russian attacks, the situation in the Donbass region in eastern Ukraine was difficult. (February 5)French and German economic ministers fly to Washington to demand state aid transparencyBrussels (ANSA) – Paris and Berlin are taking the initiative after the European Commission's proposal to open the spigots of state aid in response to the US Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). French Minister of the Economy Bruno Le Maire and his German counterpart Robert Habeck fly to Washington on Tuesday to demand ""transparency"" from Joe Biden's administration, which is committed to deploying its 370-billion-dollar-package of subsidies for the US energy transition, including tax cuts for electric cars and US-made batteries.In talks with US Commerce and Treasury Secretaries Gina Raimondo and Janet Yellen, Le Maire and Habeck will demand that the US government share the amount and recipients of aid within the scope of a â€mutual transparency mechanism.â€ ""We have to be realistic, IRA is a turning point,"" Le Maire said before the trip, stressing that the US law ""offers competitive advantages that, together with very low energy prices in the US, pose a risk for European industries.â€ The challenge, for the French minister, â€is to succeed in developing together, in the US and Europe, an efficient and competitive green industry, the most innovative on the planet.â€ (February 5)Croatia will not build walls, fences or wires on the border with Bosnia and HerzegovinaMostar (FENA) – Croatiaâ€™s Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡, in an address to delegates of the Croatian National Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) – the political umbrella organization of parties with a Croatian background in BiH – promised that his country would continue to provide strong support to the Croatian people in BiH, to help solve all their existential problems.Considering that more than a quarter of Croatian citizens were of BiH origin, said PlenkoviÄ‡, it was quite logical that the Republic of Croatia placed major emphasis on the rights of Croats in BiH. On the other hand, he added the Croatian government would not do anything that would violate the rights of other nationalities in BiH.The Croatian Prime Minister called for a strengthening of cooperation in all areas of bilateral relations. Croatia would not build walls, fences or wires on the border with BiH, but with the cooperation of its institutions, the police would prevent illegal migration, he added.PlenkoviÄ‡ stated that the Republic of Croatia would do everything in its power to help BiH on its European path. He congratulated BiH on its candidate status for membership in the European Union, announcing that he would do everything in order for BiH to catch up as soon as possible with other countries in the south-east of Europe, which were in a somewhat more advanced stage of accession negotiations. (February 4)G7 and Australia agree with EU on Russian oil price capBrussels (AFP) – On Friday, the G7 powers and Australia reached agreement on a price cap for Russian oil products, following an EU deal earlier in the day and two days before the start of an EU embargo on the products.In a joint statement, the partner countries announced that they had reached an agreement ""on the maximum prices for seaborne Russian-origin petroleum products.â€It is to be implemented from Sunday ""or very soon thereafter,"" says the text signed by the EU, Germany, Australia, the UK, Canada, France, Italy, Japan and the US.On Thursday during a visit to Kiev, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen estimated that the existing price cap on Russian oil was already costing Moscow around 160 million euros every day.On Friday, she said the bloc was readying a new round of sanctions against Russia – its 10th package since the war started a year ago.""We must continue to deprive Russia of the means to wage war against Ukraine,"" she stated, also highlighting the EUâ€™s import ban on Russian petroleum products from Sunday, February 5.""With the G7 we are putting price caps on these products, cutting Russiaâ€™s revenue while ensuring stable global energy markets,"" she said. (February 3, 2023)25-million-euro-grant for North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley projectLjubljana (STA) – The North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project, involving Slovenia, Croatia and Italy, has been awarded a 25-million-euro-grant under the Horizon Europe call for proposals. The project would start this year, as soon as the date was agreed with the European Commission, most probably in the second half of the year, said Holding Slovenske elektrarne, the Slovenian state owned power generation company and the project's lead partner.The tender was launched under the Clean Hydrogen Partnership, a public-private partnership supporting research and development of hydrogen technologies in Europe. Nine projects were selected in the tender, with a total value of 105.4 million euros, the partnership said in a press release.The North Adriatic Hydrogen Valley project is a collaboration between Slovenia, Croatia and the Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia. Among the objectives is the decarbonization of important industrial sectors, such as steel and cement production. (February 2)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Europe in brief: In the earthquake regions, more and more bodies are being recovered, while Germany and other states increase humanitarian aid.","International support is gradually arriving in Turkey and Syria, but many earthquake victims are still waiting for the help they need; an EU donor conference is planned for March. Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s new foreign minister, Elmedin KonakoviÄ‡, paid an official visit to Brussels. Migration into the EU: The Slovak Republic and others stressed the necessity of strict protection of the external borders. Bulgaria and Romania insist they have fulfilled the conditions to be accepted into Schengen.Number of earthquake deaths increases – Berlin boosts aidIstanbul/Damascus (dpa) – In regions in Syria and Turkey hit by the devastating earthquakes, more and more bodies are being recovered from the remains of collapsed buildings in the search for buried people. The Turkish authorities have corrected the number of confirmed victims upwards several times – more than 11,700 people died in the two countries (as of February 8). Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised those affected financial support, while acknowledging difficulties in rescue operations. Meanwhile, international aid has been stepped up. In Berlin, for example, the federal government increased its humanitarian aid for Syria and Turkey by a further 26 million euros. According to the Federal Foreign Office, a total of 25 million euros are earmarked for two United Nations aid funds and one million for the German Catholic NGO Malteser Hilfsdienst. Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in the Bundestag that Germany was already delivering aid to Turkey and was in close contact with the United Nations to bring humanitarian aid to the Syrian earthquake area.The situation is particularly confusing in northern Syria. Support there is difficult, not least because of the political situation – for example at the only open border crossing Bab al-Hawa between Turkey and Syria. There, a damaged road delayed the delivery of humanitarian aid. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the road has now been repaired. The UN was confident that the first trucks would be able to drive again on February 9th.Bab al-Hawa is the last of what were once four border crossings through which aid can also reach parts of Syria that are not controlled by the government. Civil war has been raging in Syria since 2011. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government now controls around two-thirds of the fragmented country again. Aid supplies that come into the country via the capital Damascus are distributed by Assad's government. There have repeatedly been reports over the past years that the government is enriching itself and ignoring areas that it considers hostile. Thousands of people are still missing in Syria alone. There is a lack of equipment to clear debris.Given the freezing temperatures, time is of the essence. Turkey in particular can rely on help from abroad. On February 8, around 50 volunteers from Germanyâ€™s Federal Agency for Technical Relief (THW) arrived in Gaziantep in the south-east of the country. Diakonie Katastrophenhilfe, a church-run aid organization, announced that partner organizations had begun distributing mattresses, winter clothing, blankets and drinking water to those affected. Many organizations called for donations. According to the Federal Ministries of the Interior and Defense, tents, sleeping bags, camp beds, blankets, heaters and generators, among other things, are being sent to the disaster area from Germany. An Interior Ministry spokesman said the deliveries amounted to about 82 tons of material with a total value of 1 million euros. According to the German air force, the Bundeswehr wants to fly out around 50 tons of relief supplies on February 9th. There are said to be three flights a day with aid deliveries.To support the earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wants to host an international donor conference together with Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson. The event is planned for March in Brussels, both sides announced on February 8, without giving a specific date. (February 8)After London and Paris, Zelensky meets EU members in BrusselsBrussels (AFP) – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in Brussels on February 9 to ask leaders of the 27 Member States meeting at the summit to deliver combat planes to him in the face of the advances of the Russian army, a year after the start of the invasion of Ukraine.After stops in London and Paris the day before, the Ukrainian President will thank the leaders of the European Union for their military, financial and humanitarian support. According to their own estimate, aid from the EU and member states has amounted to ""at least"" 67 billion euros since the outbreak of the conflict.European Parliament President Roberta Metsola hailed the visit ""a historic day for Europe.""Zelensky spoke to speak to MEPs gathered in plenary, attend the EU summit and conduct bilateral talks with bloc leaders. (February 9) New Bosnia and Herzegovina foreign minister in reform talks with EU Brussels (FENA) – The new Minister of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Elmedin KonakoviÄ‡, paid an official visit to Brussels, where he discussed with high-ranking officials of the European Union the necessary reforms that BiH must implement after it was granted the status of a candidate country last year.KonakoviÄ‡ also met with the EU-Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement, Oliver VÃ¡rhelyi, who said that the candidate status was a sign that the EU believes in BiH and shares the hope and faith of the countryâ€™s people for a better future. He added that BiH was now facing many challenges and a lot of work in the implementation of the reform agenda.Minister KonakoviÄ‡ pointed out that with his first official visit to Brussels, he wanted to underline BiH's strong commitment to the European path and the continuation of the reform process. He emphasized that after BiH had been granted the status of a candidate for EU membership, the time had come for the country to turn over a new leaf and continue the necessary reforms that would bring a better life to the citizens.During his visit to Brussels, KonakoviÄ‡ also met with the chairman of the European Parliament Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) David McAllister, the rapporteur of the European Parliament for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Paul Rangel, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Belgium, Hadja Lahbib. (February 7)Commission against setting new requirements for Bulgaria and Romania to join Schengen areaBrussels (BTA) – It is not fair to set new requirements for Bulgaria and Romania to join the Schengen Agreement, said the Vice-President of the European Commission (EC), Maros Å efÄoviÄ, after a meeting of the EU General Affairs Council. His comment was in response to a question about the additional conditions imposed by Vienna and The Hague.    â€œWe have repeatedly stated that Bulgaria and Romania fulfill all the conditions to be accepted into Schengen, both countries are really doing everything possible to prepare well for membership,â€the deputy chairman of the EC, Maros Å efÄoviÄ, said.Sefcovic said that the meeting discussed the expectation of several countries that the EU would provide a budget for the fence along the border between Bulgaria and Turkey. The EC aimed to provide a European budget where it would bring the greatest added value, explained Å efcoviÄ‡. The Commission is ready to allocate funds for the repair and expansion of border posts, for border surveillance and maintenance, new computer networks and training of border guards.In an interview for BTA, MEP Ilhan Kyuchuk stated that the issue of the Schengen accession was undermining the trust of Bulgarian citizens in the EU and stigmatizing Bulgarian society.

Europe's emergency response to the earthquake in Turkey and Syria,"On Monday, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake struck south-eastern Turkey, near the border with Syria. While the death toll continues to rise and search rescue operations drag on, countries in Europe and beyond are offering their assistance.The quake, which has cost thousands of lives so far, is one of the most devastating in the region in recent history. While Turkey is not a member of the EU and relations have not always been smooth, offers of assistance came quickly. Providing assistance for victims in Syria, however, may yet prove more difficult, with more than a decade of civil war making humanitarian access to many regions hard.By Friday afternoon, the number of deaths in the aftermath of the earthquake and aftershocks along the Turkish-Syrian border had surpassed 22,000, as hopes of still finding survivors in the rubble faded by the hour.Following the disaster, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ announced that the so-called EU Civil Protection Mechanism, through which other countries can request emergency assistance from the EU, had been activated.The mechanism, established by the European Commission in October 2001, aims to strengthen cooperation on civil protection to improve prevention, preparedness and response to disasters between the EU Member States and 8 participating third countries (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and Turkey).Turkey, soon after it was rocked by the earthquake, requested assistance through the mechanism. Following the request, the EUâ€™s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) began to mobilize assistance and expertise.On Wednesday, Syria also requested assistance by appealing to the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism. When Damascus made the move, LenarÄiÄ said the European Commission was asking European countries ""to respond favorably to this request.""The Syrian government launched an appeal to the EU to lift sanctions against the country. LenarÄiÄ pointed out that the measures were introduced after the Syrian civil war erupted in 2011, and are targeted solely at the regime for its repression of the population. These sanctions would not hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid or emergency assistance, he assured.The operations in Turkey and Syria are among the largest search and rescue operations ever launched under the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism. In addition, the European Union is releasing 6.5 million euros in emergency humanitarian assistance for the victims of the devastating earthquakes, the European Commission announced on Wednesday.On Thursday, Commissioner LenarÄiÄ traveled to Turkey to visit the affected areas. In the early afternoon, he arrived in Gaziantep, a city in the south-eastern part of the country near the epicenter of the earthquake.European rescue squads join forcesThe EU, together with other countries in Europe and beyond, responded with humanitarian aid from the onset of the emergency in Turkey and Syria.Up until Thursday, European countries had deployed a total of 31 rescue teams and 5 medical teams, composed of over 1,500 rescue personnel and about 100 rescue dogs. The teams were dispatched from 20 European countries, including numerous EU member states, Albania, Montenegro and Serbia via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.On Monday, Romania was among the first countries to respond to Turkeyâ€™s request for international assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. A comprehensive support team of 58 people has been deployed, the Romanian Department for Emergency Situations announced. On Wednesday, three military airplanes of the Romanian Air Force transported a rescue team, medical personnel, search-and-rescue materials and equipment, as well as basic supplies to Turkey. Currently, two support teams from Romania are present in Turkey.Also on Monday, two Bulgarian military transport aircraft flew to the region hit by the disaster, carrying 73 rescuers and over 30 units of specialized equipment. On Wednesday, Sofia sent two teams of its Military Medical Academy, 58 firefighters and 12 rescuers to Turkey and, on Thursday, said it was ready to provide 30 more medics and secure one or two more flights to Adana on Saturday. The cost of these flights is to be reimbursed by the EU.The spokeswoman of the Ministry of the Interior of the Slovak Republic, Zuzana EliÃ¡Å¡ovÃ¡, said on Monday that Slovakia is sending ten members of its Fire and Rescue Corps (HaZZ) and five mountain rescuers with specially trained dogs to Turkey. Slovakia sent the aid in response to a request from the European Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC). The deployment of the teams from HaZZ and the Mountain Rescue Service was supported by the European Union.Slovenia sent a group of seven rescue dogs with handlers plus four assistants to Turkey on Tuesday. It also sent an expert to assist with coordination under the European Civil Protection Mechanism. Two more assessment and coordination experts from Slovenia are ready to depart if called upon.Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ stated that 40 rescuers from Croatia, including members of the Civil Protection Directorate, firefighting units and the Croatian Mountain Rescue Service (HGSS), had left for Turkey Monday evening.The Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina approved half a million euros from the state budget with the aim of repairing damages after the devastating earthquakes in Turkey. Around 100 members of civil protection have been sent to Turkey so far.The Spanish Ministry of the Interior activated the Military Emergency Unit, personnel from the Community of Madrid and emergency air transport to support search tasks. In addition, a field hospital will be sent to the disaster area by the Spanish Agency for International Cooperation and Development.Additional initiatives and future assistanceWhile rescue operations continue, local, national and international donor initiatives kicked off throughout Europe. Their aim is to provide Turkey and Syria with material aid, such as food, other goods and shelter.In Bosnia and Herzegovina, several humanitarian organizations established emergency aid hotlines. Many people responded to the call for help and substantial donations were made, which will be directed to helping the victims of the earthquakes.On Tuesday, Caritas Croatia – the Croatian branch of the Catholic international nonprofit organization for humanitarian relief and development assistance – started collecting donations for earthquake victims in Turkey and Syria. Caritas Internationalis and Caritas Europa are also involved in the efforts to help victims in Turkey and Syria.Slovenian aid and charity organizations, including Unicef Slovenija, the Slovenian Red Cross and Caritas Slovenia, have also launched aid and donation campaigns.Several donation campaigns were organized in Bulgaria to support the earthquake victims, through both social media and official institutions. Municipalities all over the country, as well as various civil and political organizations, started fundraising and volunteer campaigns to help.In Romania, several tons of food, water and clothes, heaters and generators, hygienic and sanitary materials, powdered milk and diapers intended for victims in Turkey and Syria were collected to be sent to areas affected by earthquakes.On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that the EU plans to host a donor conference in March to mobilize international aid for Syria and Turkey to deal with the devastating impact of this week's earthquake.""We are now racing against the clock to save lives together. Soon we will provide relief aid, together,"" von der Leyen wrote on Twitter.The EU said the conference would be held early next month in Brussels in coordination with Turkish authorities to ""mobilize funds globally for the affected communities"" of both countries.The event is aimed at coordinating the international response to the disaster and ""will be open to EU member states, neighboring countries, UN members, international financial institutions and other relevant stakeholders"" and international lenders, the European Commission stated.This article is published Fridays.

"Fabricated quote about defeating Russia to 'avenge Napoleon, Hitler' attributed to EU diplomat","As Western countries pledged to step up deliveries of weapons to Ukraine, social media users in Thailand shared a fabricated quote that the European Union's most senior diplomat Josep Borrell called to ""keep using Ukrainians as our bait"" in order to defeat Russia and ""avenge Napoleon and Hitler"". While Borrell mentioned Napoleon and Hitler in a speech about the war in Ukraine, he was speaking in the context of Russia's past military victories and did not say they should be ""avenged"".""Europe declares Russia must be defeated to wash away the shame of Napoleon and Hitler,"" reads a Thai-language Facebook post shared on January 21 on a page with more than 54,000 followers.It says the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell gave a speech to ""cheer up"" EU members, in which he said: ""We used to fight to the end. Russia was almost defeated in the past but then it rebuilt everything. Russia did that to European leaders Napoleon and Hitler, who were painfully defeated.""For this new war, we have to keep using Ukrainians as our bait. The Europeans, on behalf of NATO, have to do everything to not lose to Russia, otherwise our predecessors Napoleon and Hitler will be ashamed of us.""Napoleon invaded Russia in 1812 but suffered a catastrophic retreat from Moscow that proved a huge blow to his plans to dominate Europe. During World War II, Hitler's forces occupied vast swathes of Soviet territory before Germany's crushing defeat in 1945.Text superimposed on a photo of Hitler says in Thai: ""EU proclamation! Russia must be defeated to avenge Napoleon and Hitler"", while the post links to a blog post that repeats the false claim.Screenshot of the misleading Facebook post, captured on February 2, 2023Similar Facebook posts shared the fabricated quote, including here, here and here, as Western countries stepped up their weapons deliveries to Ukraine, nearly a year after Russia's full-scale invasion.Moscow has drawn parallels between World War II and the Ukraine conflict and referred to the invasion as a ""special military operation"" to ""de-Nazify"" its neighbour.'Manipulation'The European Commission's lead spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy, Peter Stano said the claim was ""manipulation and disinformation"".Borrell had ""absolutely not"" spoken of avenging Napoleon or Hitler, he told AFP on January 26.Stano pointed AFP to a Spanish-language speech that Borrell gave at a New Economic Forum event in Madrid on January 20, in which he mentioned Napoleon and Hitler.But he had spoken about Russia's ""performance in the war against the armies led by them"".In the speech, Borrell says in Spanish: ""Ukrainians are still defending their country. There is no wave of Ukrainians fleeing, which is what Putin wanted to provoke.""But let's keep in mind that Russia is a great country, it's a great nation that is used to fighting to the end. And it is used to almost losing and then recovering. It did that with Napoleon and it did that with Hitler. It would be absurd to think that Russia has lost the war or that its military is incompetent. So far it has been losing the war but it still has enormous strength and capacity to continue it.""That is why it is now when it is necessary to continue arming Ukraine, with the material and military means necessary to wage the kind of war it has to wage, not only a defensive war, but a war that allows it to take the initiative, to break fronts and to prevent Russia from launching a new very powerful and bloody offensive in a few months' time.""Various news outlets reported on Borrell's comments, including Russian state broadcaster RT and Spain-based publications Notimerica and ElNacional.cat.AFP has debunked a wave of misinformation on the Ukraine-Russia conflict.Panisa AEMOCHAAll articlesAFP ThailandAll articlesUkraine-Russia conflictFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2023.

MEP Tineke Strik thinks the EU should better support Bosnia and Herzegovina and other states in the Western Balkans.Belgium backs Commission in Hungarian 'anti-gay' law case before EU CourtBrussels (Belga) – Belgium is joining the European Commission's proceedings before the EU Court of Justice against Hungary over its so-called 'anti-gay law'. Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib announced this on Monday.The controversial law, officially designed to protect minors, prohibits the representation or promotion of ""different gender identity at birth, gender reassignment or homosexuality."" Quickly, the legislation became known as an ""anti-gay law"". The Commission opened infringement proceedings against Hungary in 2021, claiming the law discriminates against individuals on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity. In particular, the Commission believes that the law curtails the fundamental rights of LGBTQI+ persons.Because Hungary did not heed the criticism, the Commission went to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg last year, which must now examine whether the legislation is compatible with European law. Belgium was now siding with the Commission in that procedure, Minister Lahbib said.""The fight against discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression has always been a priority for our country,"" explains Lahbib. She recalls that Belgium was at the forefront of a joint declaration by 18 EU member states in 2021, in which they expressed concern about the Hungarian law, which discriminates against LGBTQI+ persons â€œunder the guise of child protectionâ€ and â€œviolates the right to freedom of speech.â€The fact that Belgium is now intervening before the EU Court is a logical consequence of this statement, according to Lahbib. "" We note that the rights of the LGBTQI+ community are under increasing pressure in many places, including within Europe. (â€¦) It is a worrying trend that needs to be reversed. That is why Belgium – after putting the case on the international agenda – will now also intervene before the European Court of Justice to defend the rights of LGBTQI+ people. Our country has the firm ambition to continue playing a pioneering role both nationally and internationally.â€ (February 13)Greece and Turkey get closer diplomatically after earthquakesAthens (dpa) – After the devastating earthquakes in Turkey, there is a cautious rapprochement with neighboring Greece, despite many conflicts between the two countries. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias unexpectedly flew to the disaster area on 12 February and met with his Turkish counterpart MevlÃ¼t Cavusoglu. As shown on Greek state television, the two politicians hugged. Cavusoglu thanked Greece for the aid the country provided. The states would try to solve their problems in a dialogue, he added. ""Greece's help to the Turkish people does not end here,"" Dendias assured. Athens would ""do everything"" – bilaterally and also within the EU framework – to help Turkey, Dendias added. He was the first EU foreign minister to visit the disaster zone, Greek state television reported. Several Greek rescue teams are working in the Antakya and Hatay region. For days, political observers and commentators in the Greek press had been expressing hope that the aid spontaneously given by Greece to Turkey could be a new start in relations between the NATO members.After the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece in 1999, there had already been a relaxation in the relations between the two countries. At that time, the two countries had provided each other with rescue teams and humanitarian aid. This aid gradually developed into a rapprochement known as ""earthquake diplomacy"", which initiated a phase of dÃ©tente that lasted for more than ten years. Recently, there had been renewed tensions.Athens and Ankara have been arguing over sovereign rights in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean for decades. In recent months, the Turkish president had repeatedly threatened to invade Greek islands. On the other hand, there have been gestures of dÃ©tente between Armenia and Turkey of late. The former Soviet republic sent rescue teams to the neighboring country despite the strained relationship. Not long ago, Turkey had opened a border crossing with Armenia. (February 12)MEP Tineke Strik: The European Union should provide more active support to BiHBrussels (FENA) – The Dutch MEP Tineke Strik believes that the European Union should make a stronger commitment and provide more active support to Bosnia and Herzegovina and actors working for the rule of law and civil society. The bloc should also offer young people an economic perspective for the future.Speaking at the meeting of the Association of Independent Intellectuals, Circle 99 (Bosnian: Krug 99) – a leading Bosnian think-tank established in Sarajevo in 1993 – on the topic ""From Dayton to Brussels: BiH's path towards the EU and the latest decisions of the OHR"", Strik said that the elections held in BiH last year should have been a day of celebration of democracy. They should have been an important step and an incentive for further reforms in BiH, but due to the decisions of High Representative Christian Schmidt, a step back towards ethnic divisions and nepotism had been taken.The Office of the High Representative (OHR) is an ad hoc international institution responsible for overseeing the implementation of civilian aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement ending the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina. High Representative Christian Schmidt imposed changes to the Election Law of BiH on the day of the General Elections in October last year. Schmidt argued he had made the move to remove a blockade.""My colleagues from the European Parliament and I criticized the decisions of the High Representative, because we need reforms that will be inclusive and we need to follow a path that will lead us to full democracy instead of returning to nationalist divisions,"" said Strik.She stated that, in light of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the level of awareness in the European Union regarding the importance of the Western Balkans getting closer to the EU had increased, that greater commitment was underway and that the EU had determined that one of its priorities was to speed up the accession of the Western Balkan countries to the EU.""In order to achieve this, we need unity within the EU related to policies towards the Western Balkans, but we also need unity against foreign interference by states in internal affairs. We must also make sure that member states such as Croatia and Hungary donâ€™t prioritize their national interests unilaterally in the processâ€,"" Strik added.According to her, the European Union should take a stricter stance regarding the conditions of further funding and the EU accession process. Strik added that 14 priorities of the European Commission were known and that the EU should be very clear that it was necessary to implement democratic reforms. (February 12)EU to provide funds for Bulgarian-Turkish border securityBrussels (BTA) – The European Commission will fund two pilot projects for border guards, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said after an extraordinary European Council meeting on February 9.Von der Leyen said the EU would provide funds for vehicles, cameras and watchtowers along the border. Bulgarian President Rumen Radev said that in recent months, efforts had been made to provide more solidarity and support to all countries on the frontline of the EU's external borders.Acting Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Demerdzhiev said that the Commission intended to carry out a pilot project on the Bulgarian-Turkish border. He said that the debate on the fence and its financing was ongoing. In his words, the costs of building fences on the external European borders cannot be borne by the states independently.In an interview, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, who had been pushing for the EU to provide 2 billion euros for a better wall along the Bulgarian-Turkish border, said that with the European Council's decision Bulgaria would get funds for staff, vehicles, technical equipment and security, and would thus be able to redirect national funds for the fence.The European Parliament decided to discuss again the issue on Wednesday. According to the president of the European Council Charles Michel, EU heads of state and government will discuss the issue again at their next meeting in March.

"Europe in brief: Brussels sues Poland, Bulgaria suspends military supplies to Ukraine pending parliament's decision, MEPs urge EU states to ratify directive against violence against women","The European Commission sues Poland over EU primacy challenge. Bulgaria stops sending weapons to Ukraine until the formation of a new government in April. MEPs demand the EU to ratify the Istanbul Convention to mitigate violence against women. Compliance with EU treaties: Brussels takes Poland to EU courtBrussels (AFP) – On Wednesday, the European Commission announced that it would take Poland to the EU Court over rulings by the Polish Constitutional Court that challenge the primacy of European law, a move that could ultimately lead to financial sanctions.The European executive, which monitors compliance with the EU treaties, had sent Poland a ""reasoned opinion"" last July, which was the next step in an infringement procedure launched in December 2021.Warsaw's response, which rejected the ""reasoning"" of the reasoned opinion, ""does not address the commissionâ€™s concerns."" The Commission has therefore decided to bring an action against Poland before the Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU), Brussels said in a statement.For several years, the EU has been engaged in a tug-of-war with the conservative nationalist government in Warsaw over its judicial reforms, which are accused of undermining the independence of judges. (February 15)Sofia opposes sending weapons to Ukraine but reaffirms support for Ukraineâ€™s territorial integritySofia (BTA) – Earlier this week, Bulgarian President Rumen Radev told journalists that he was categorically opposed to sending weapons from the reserves of the Bulgarian Army to the zone of hostilities. He expected the next decisions on military assistance to be taken after another early parliamentary election in April and the formation of a regular government.â€œIn the first hours Bulgaria stated a clear position and strongly condemns the Kremlinâ€™s aggression against a sovereign state, but I continue to believe that this conflict does not have a military solution, which can only be achieved with an immediate ceasefire and dialogue,â€ said President Rumen Radev.Bulgariaâ€™s Foreign Ministry reaffirmed the countryâ€™s commitment to Ukraine: â€œWe stand united in our support for all Ukrainian citizens, we pay tribute to Ukraine and its people for their courage and sacrifice in defending their inalienable right to decide their own future. We remain committed to our unwavering support for Ukraineâ€™s independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, as well as its European perspective.â€(February 14, 15)EU Parliament wants to mitigate violence against womenFoto: Denis Lomme/EP/dpaStrasbourg (dpa) – According to the European Parliament, the EU should accede as soon as possible to the Convention to Combat Violence against Women. The Istanbul Convention remains the most important instrument for mitigating violence against women, MEPs said in Strasbourg on February 15. One in three women in the EU has already experienced physical or sexual violence. Therefore, the convention must finally be ratified by the EU, they said.Six years after the convention was signed, the EU has reportedly still not ratified it because six EU countries – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia – have so far refused to do so in the Council. However, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in 2021 that the EU could ratify the agreement even without a joint agreement. Poland is currently trying to revoke the agreement.

State of play after 15 years of Kosovo's independence,"Today, Kosovo marks the 15th anniversary of its declaration of independence from Serbia. While the EU continues to facilitate a dialogue aimed at normalizing relations between Serbia and Kosovo, Belgrade is balancing between its ties with Russia and China and its wish for EU membership.Tensions between Belgrade and Pristina have been high ever since Kosovo declared independence from Serbia on February 17, 2008. The EU plays a pivotal role in the dialogue process between Belgrade and Pristina to ensure the de-escalation of tensions between Serbia and Kosovo and bring about peace and stability in the Western Balkans region.Kosovo, which is almost exclusively inhabited by ethnic Albanians today, used to be part of Serbia, which does not recognize its former province as a sovereign state.The most recent tensions were originally sparked by the Pristina government's decision to invalidate old Serbian car license plates, which most residents in northern Kosovo and the surrounding area still use to drive around today. At the end of 2022, following the arrest of a former police officer of Serbian ethnicity on allegations of inciting attacks on electoral commission officials, militant Serbs erected barricades at a dozen points in the region, blocking access roads to two border crossings into Serbia. Under pressure from Western embassies, Kosovo's Prime Minister Albin Kurti suspended the implementation of the number plate decree. Serbia agreed to stop issuing licence plates with Kosovo Cities' denominations.Serbia, as well as five EU member states – Romania, Slovakia, Cyprus, Spain and Greece – do not recognize Kosovoâ€™s sovereignty to this day. The Serbian government, backed by Russia and China, is blocking Kosovo's integration into international institutions.Ongoing negotiations: progress or impasse?Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani recently recalled that it was crucial to stabilize the Balkans region, particularly with regard to migration. The issue of migration flows along the Balkan route was ""key for Italy,"" he said. Many irregular migrants were entering Europe along that route, he added. The Western Balkans route was the most active migratory route in 2022, with more than 139,000 illegal entries being recorded that year.On the situation between Serbia and Kosovo, Tajani said that ""we need a comprehensive and binding deal, otherwise we will always find ourselves mediating in tense situations that calm down for a few months and then start again."" Referring to the dialogue facilitated by the EU, the Italian minister added that ""the EU has the responsibility to help solve open issues.â€During last weekâ€™s European Council summit, EU leaders adopted a conclusion on the dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina. The conclusion ""emphasizes the urgent need for progress in the normalization of relations between Kosovo and Serbia"", adds that the European proposal is a ""historic chance"" for the European perspective and calls for the implementation of all obligations, ""including the agreements from 2013 and 2015 on the creation of the Association/Community of Serb Municipalities.""In 2013, under the EU dialogue, Belgrade and Pristina reached an agreement on the establishment of an association/community of municipalities with a Serbian majority, especially intended to facilitate the integration of 4 municipalities in northern Kosovo, from Serbia into Kosovoâ€™s system – the so called â€œBrussels Agreementâ€. Currently, the Kosovo authorities do not control 10 municipalities, where the Serbian majority lives. The authorities in those 10 municipalities are under direct control of Belgrade.On Monday, February 13, Serbian Prime Minister Ana BrnabiÄ‡ said that Serbia was always ready for dialogue and would always be there to talk with Pristina, but that the Association/Community of Serb Municipalities had to be established and that this time this had to be the joint position of Serbia and its Western partners – primarily the EU and the US. Kosovo, however, has not yet implemented the association/community.Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti said that he supports the proposal in principle and that it was a good basis for negotiations that should lead to a solution. At the same time, Kurti emphasized six principles. Firstly, the association/community of municipalities with a Serbian majority must exist in accordance with the constitution and laws of Kosovo. Secondly, it cannot be mono-ethnic. Thirdly, it must not have executive power. Fourthly, the principle of reciprocity is applied, meaning that Albanians in Serbia have the same rights as Serbs in Kosovo. Fifthly, the illegal structures of Serbia in the north of Kosovo are to be terminated and all illegal weapons to be handed over. Finally, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ should withdraw the letters he sent to the leaders of the 5 EU member states that do not recognize Kosovo. In those letters, VuÄiÄ‡ asked them to reject Kosovo's candidacy for EU membership.The president of the Bosnia and Herzegovina entity of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, stated that the Association/Community of Serb Municipalities should have executive powers and resemble the Republika Srpska, which has a high degree of autonomy based on the Dayton Peace Agreement. Said agreement, signed on 21 November 1995, ended the war in Bosnia, preserving the country as one state composed of two entities.The comparisons to Republika Srpska, in regard to the situation between Kosovo and Serbia, were rejected by international proponents of the formation of an association/community of Serb municipalities in Kosovo. US State Department adviser Derek Chollet said that it was important for the United States of America that the Association/Community of Serb Municipalities be formed in Kosovo, but that it should not resemble the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina.Belgradeâ€™s dilemma after the Russian invasion of UkraineRussia's attack on Ukraine ended the previous approach of trying to normalize relations between Serbia and Kosovo.Under the leadership of Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, Serbia negotiated with the European Union, to which he promised reforms. He also had excellent relations with Germany during the time of Chancellor Angela Merkel. On the other hand, he cooperated well with Russia, China and Turkey.With the Russian attack on Ukraine, the security situation has changed and Serbia has been under enormous pressure to decide which camp it will join. While it is being asked to impose sanctions on Russia – which it still persistently refuses – Russia threatens to recognize Kosovo's independence if Belgrade joins Western sanctions against it.A recent German-Franco proposal stipulates, among other things, that Serbia and Kosovo need not formally recognize each other, but should mutually accept each other's statehood within the current borders. In particular, Serbia should stop blocking Kosovo's applications to become a member of international organizations – as it has been doing with active Russian support.At the beginning of February, VuÄiÄ‡ told the Serbian parliament that this stipulation in particular was difficult to comply with or even unacceptable from Serbia's point of view. International negotiators have threatened to stop talks on Serbia's accession into the European Union, which have been ongoing since 2014, as well as halt foreign investment, if Belgrade does not comply.VuÄiÄ‡ recently stated that Western negotiators had given him two options: Either to accept the plan or to face the termination of EU accession negotiations and the withdrawal of foreign investment. ""It is in Serbia's vital interest to stay on the European path,"" the Serbian leader emphasized.Last week, High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said he had invited Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti and Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡  to ""return to Brussels soon, in a couple of weeks.â€ Borrell said he wanted to push through the proposed German-Franco agreement for normalizing relations between Belgrade and Pristina, emphasizing the importance of both sides ""avoiding any type of escalation"" and ""working seriously on the proposal"" for an agreement.According to Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, â€œthe work on the EU dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina continues every day. The EU Special Representative Miroslav LajÄÃ¡k continues to reach out to partners at his level and High Representative Borrell at his top political level.â€Borrell will meet both Kosovo Prime Minister Kurti and Serbian President VuÄiÄ‡ in Munich, Germany, over the weekend for separate bilateral talks, â€œto see how to move the process forward based on the recent EU proposal,â€ Stano added. Today, the European External Action Service confirmed that Borrell will also meet Kurti and VuÄiÄ‡ in Brussels on 27 February.This article is published Fridays.

Other topics: EPP cancels Naples summit over Berlusconiâ€™s Ukraine remarks and Austria maintains military neutrality in the Ukraine war. Brussels expects political will to unblock judicial reform in SpainBrussels (EFE) – The European Commission (EC) still expects ""political will"" to soon unblock the renewal of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ) and reform the system for electing judges in Spain, said Vice-President and Commissioner for Values and Transparency Vera JourovÃ¡.At a meeting with European media, including EFE, JourovÃ¡ recalled the two requests that Brussels had addressed to Spain in the annual reports on the rule of law in the European Union, the last of which was published in July.""We insist that Spain has to do two things: put the judiciary in order and appoint and designate the necessary judges"" for the replacements, to ensure a full functioning of the institutions and a ""reform the system,"" Vera JourovÃ¡ added.The 2022 Rule of Law report encouraged Spain to proceed with the renewal of the CGPJ ""as a matter of priority"" and to ""initiate, immediately after the renewal, a process to adapt the appointment of its members, taking into account European standards,"" she recalled.

""I have never received requests that we should supply weapons,"" Schallenberg said on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference (MSC) last Friday. ""It is recognized that we are doing an incredible amount in other areas,"" Edtstadler added, referring to humanitarian aid.In this regard, Edtstadler recounted her recent visit to Kiev, where there was a fire following a Russian missile attack. ""The firefighter was wearing protective gear from [the Austrian city] Graz,"" she said. Schallenberg pointed out that, measured in terms of its economic output, Austria ranks first when it comes to humanitarian aid for Ukraine. He also said Austria was ""riding sharply on the edge (of) what is possible under neutrality law"" in the conflict.The foreign minister also aroused attention with his positive comments on German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who had been heavily criticized domestically for his perceived hesitation on military support for Ukraine. ""I am glad that the leaders of these states who are delivering [it] are not taking it lightly, but are very visibly struggling for the right decision, which also takes time,"" Schallenberg stressed. He said he expected that the war ""will be with us for most of the year, if not all of it"" and that ""not all levels of escalation have been reached yet."" ""What we don't want is for this war to expand,"" he stressed.

Beyond Fake News: Fact Check workshop in the European Newsroom,"Disinformation, misinformation, fake news - journalists are confronted with these every day in their work. How can you tell if a social media account is genuine and a photo really represents what it depicts? Around 20 journalists from news agencies across Europe got to the bottom of these questions in enr's  fact check workshop.Does the internet video really show an attack on Kyiv airport? Is that really the Instagram account of the Russian foreign minister? And how to can I find deleted tweets on the web? The program, organized by AFP, included tricks for verifying pictures, videos and social media accounts. In addition to the basics of fact-checking, participants learned the latest methods in fact-checking and can now check whether a photo really shows what it suggests, or whether a social media account is real or fake.Correspondents from the Italian ANSA, the Belgium Belga, the Croatian HINA, EFE from Spain and the Romanian AGERPRES explored these questions together with AFP's fact checker Alexis Orsini in a workshop. For this purpose, they met in mid-February in the European Newsroom in Brussels. In a second session, colleagues who could not be on-site attended the online workshop. There were journalists from Romania's AGERPRES, North Macedonia's MIA, Bosnia and Herzegovina's FENA, Slovenia's STA and Bulgaria's BTA as well as the Spanish Europa Press. https://twitter.com/enr_newsroom/status/1628066332129341442",1
Misinformation swirls over EU edible insects,"Eurosceptics have a new bugbear, claiming that Brussels has a clandestine plan to make people eat insects in a misinformation narrative flourishing on and offline.Recent European Union approvals for food ingredients derived from house crickets and beetle larvae, which the EU says are part of a push to find more sustainable nutrition sources, have stoked a surge in misleading claims on social media.Some social media posts falsely suggest that there will be no labelling requirements for food containing the ingredients, or make unfounded links between the insect products and a litany of diseases.Â Other posts suggest the EU approvals are further proof of a conspiracy theory that a global elite is plotting to cull humanity – this time by force-feeding people dangerous bugs. But the wave of scaremongering has gone beyond online echo chambers.Â Politicians in several European countries have variously framed the product approvals as a move by Brussels to dupe people into eating creepy-crawlies, an assault on traditional national cuisines and, at the more extreme end, a sinister masterplan that puts lives at risk. ""I don't want locusts for my breakfast!"" spluttered British arch-eurosceptic Nigel Farage. ""On the labelling of the food, it will say 'Acheta Domesticus'. So we all understand fully what that means, obviously,"" he said on the GB News channel on January 27, referring to the scientific name for the house cricket. Farage framed the approvals as a reason for Britain to disengage from EU food standards in what he described as a ""proper Brexit"".French senator Laurent Duplomb, of the conservative Les Republicains party, told the Senate on January 25 that French people would ""eat insects without their knowledge"" and that the new ingredients would be included in food ""without clearly informing consumers"".""How did we get here, having to consume crickets that come from the same family as grasshoppers or locusts, while France is the country of gastronomy and terroirs?"" said Duplomb, a farmer who has criticised the EU for, he says, undermining the French agricultural sector.What do the EU regulations actually say?In fact, the newly approved ingredients must be listed by both their scientific and everyday names, according toÂ labelling requirements in the publicly available European Commission authorisation documents from January 2023. The documents state that labels on foods containing insect products must feature a warning that they may cause an allergic reaction.Â The documents also explain that the ingredients have been deemed safe for human consumption through a scientific analysis by the European Food Safety Authority.Since 2021, the EU has authorised the sale of products derived from the house cricket, the migratory locust, yellow mealworm larvae and lesser mealworm larvae, all with the same labelling requirements and health checks.Nevertheless, in Bulgaria, where anti-EU rhetoric from some political parties is ramping up ahead of the country's unlikely plan to join the euro in 2024, the move was presented as life-threatening. The former interior minister and leader of the pro-Russian ABV party, Rumen Petkov, described the permissions as a ""crime against Europe"" in anÂ interviewÂ with pro-Kremlin media outlet Pogled.Â He accused the European Commission -- the EU's executive arm -- of being ""prepared to kill our European children"", who he suggested would unwittingly eat the insect products in their favourite snacks.Although the EU approvals do not make insect ingredients mandatory in any food product, some politicians framed the permissions as an imposition from which their countries must be protected by national government.In Hungary, where tensions with Brussels have been high over frozen funds, agriculture minister Istvan Nagy warned that ""traditional eating habits may be in danger"" and promised the government would bring in new regulations to ensure what he said was clear labelling. Just another euromyth?Half-baked stories about EU regulations on everything from the bendiness of bananas to the sizing of condoms have circulated for decades.But the idea that Brussels is obsessed with feeding insects to the people of Europe seems to be travelling more widely than other so-called ""euromyths"", says Simon Usherwood, Professor of Politics and International Studies at The Open University. ""What's interesting with this story is that it's popping up in lots of different countries, because historically euromyths have been very country specific,"" he told AFP. ""It might just be the nature of the subject -– it speaks to general disgust,"" he said.Usherwood added that euromyths can have a significant impact on public opinion over time, filling a knowledge gap about the EU with tropes about bonkers Brussels bureaucrats. ""None of these stories in themselves is like the end of civilisation. It's a quirky thing,"" Usherwood told AFP.Â ""But it's that cumulative drip, drip, drip aspect that reinforces prejudices and conceptions and misconceptions about what the EU is."" Usherwood cited the example of the UK's 2016 referendum that resulted in it leaving the EU.""Whilst it is often meant as just a bit of fun, it also comes with an agenda that, as we've seen if you think about the British debate, does actually contribute over the long run to real significant shaping of public attitudes towards the European Union."" ""With the (Brexit) referendum, for a lot of people, if you said 'bendy bananas' it was a thing you knew about. In terms of what (the EU actually) did, most people didn't know.""This article is written by AFP's Laura Mannering, with Nathan Gallo, Rossen Bossev and Ede Zaborszky.Copyright AFP 2017-2023.

"The invasion of Ukraine, one year on","One year after Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, the EU and the US stand united with Kiev. Time for a recap and look ahead. On the anniversary of the beginning of the conflict, Ukraineâ€™s First Lady Olena Zelenska said in a video address before the United Nations on Wednesday that Russia must be held accountable for crimes. ""Ukraine's victory will mean the victory of human rights over lawlessness, torture and destruction. Therefore, justice for Ukraine is justice for the entire world,"" she told UN delegates.A year into Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine, the EU and the US continue to stress that they stand with Ukraine and condemn Russia's military aggression. United with Washington in supporting Kiev, European leaders are supplying Ukraine with arms. So far, 3,6 billion euro were mobilized under the European Peace Facility. On top of this, there is military training for the Ukrainian armed forces. In total, EU military support for Ukraine – provided by the European Peace Facility and the Member States directly – amounts to approximately 12 billion euros.Besides, the EU has sought to weaken Russia's economy with harsh sanctions. In the aftermath of the start of the military operation in Ukraine, the Russian economy seemed on the brink of collapse, crushed by unprecedented Western sanctions: The stock market closed for a month, the ruble exchange rate plummeted and there was the specter of an 8-percent drop in GDP and inflation at 20 percent. Twelve months later, it is clear that Moscow has been hit but has not been brought to its knees or isolated from the world, relying especially on a very strong increase in oil and gas revenues. Although, points out UCLA economist Oleg Itskhoki, as energy prices fall, ""the crisis could take its full toll in 2023.""At the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the European Union, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez warned that the EU could not lower pressure on the Kremlin, while recalling that it was necessary to reinforce the successive packages of sanctions that have been adopted over the last year and close any remaining gaps. SÃ¡nchez demanded that the tenth package of sanctions should be launched on February 24.In addition, SÃ¡nchez stressed that it was vital to maintain the unity of the EU in the face of the Russian invasion and to ensure that countries which are not part of the club also support the peace plan presented by the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky.Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said the key word for Ukraine and the West was sustainability: â€œSustainability of Ukrainians in their resistance, sustainability of Western aid to Ukraine and sustainability of Western governments to live up to the challenges they are faced with, namely energy prices, inflation, food and keeping of social cohesion in our countries.â€Humanitarian and financial supportIn addition to military aid, the EU and most its members have provided extensive financial and humanitarian aid, constantly emphasizing that Ukraine can count on the EUâ€™s support as long as it is needed. Furthermore, for the first time in the history of the EU, the Temporary Protection Directive was unanimously adopted by all EU countries, granting beneficiaries residence rights and access to housing, schools, health care and jobs. So far, around 4 million persons fleeing Ukraine have registered for temporary protection.Slovenia supports Ukraine with humanitarian, material and military aid. In addition to providing assistance to approximately 8.000 Ukrainian refugees who have so far applied for temporary protection in Slovenia, the country has also announced support in the reconstruction of critical infrastructure as well as demining. According to a recent assessment by Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, the total value of aid sent to Ukraine from Slovenia so far exceeds 27 million euros.Since last February, some 1,100,000 Ukrainian refugees have transited Bulgaria. About 150,000 asked for international protection and 50,000 decided to stay in the country, data shared by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees show. Bulgaria granted 240 million euros worth of humanitarian and other aid to Ukraine, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. Sofia sent military equipment and materials for shelter and self-protection to Ukraine, and received wounded Ukrainian soldiers for treatment. Bulgarian experts also train the Ukrainian military within the scope of the EU Military Assistance Mission.Bosnia and Herzegovina: Divided over the war in UkraineBy signing the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) committed to follow the EU's security and foreign policy, but this causes problems in practice. BiH has not taken a unified stance on the Ukraine war. While the members of the Presidency elected in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡ and Denis BeÄ‡iroviÄ‡, unequivocally condemn the Russian invasion, the Chair of the Presidency elected in the BiH entity Republika Srpska (RS), Å½eljka CvijanoviÄ‡, insists that Bosnia and Herzegovina should remain neutral, despite the fact that RS maintains close ties with Moscow.When the war had already started, CvijanoviÄ‡ and Milorad Dodik, the leader of the Serb political party Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD) in BiH, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, assuring him that Bosnia and Herzegovina would not side with the western countries over Ukraine. A delegation from the National Assembly of Republika Srpska, led by Chairman Nenad StevandiÄ‡, traveled to Moscow this week, reaffirming that RS would not â€œjoin the anti-Russian hysteriaâ€, while condemning any attempt to portray RS as a Russian platform in Europe. ""We hope the future will show that our neutral stance was right. Small countries like ours do not have the privilege of interfering in conflicts,"" StevandiÄ‡ added.This division within the state further fuels fears of a spill-over of the Russian-Ukrainian crisis into Bosnia and Herzegovina, although analysts believe that destabilization of the Western Balkans is not a realistic scenario at present. Nevertheless, the EUFOR forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina received a reinforcement of 500 soldiers last year because of the concern that the crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine could spread to the Western Balkans, particularly to Bosnia and Herzegovina.New world order?Russia's invasion of its neighbor has upended parts of the world order and led to a forming of blocs not seen since the Cold War. The war has intensified conflicts and confrontations, as well as the pre-existing global tendency for countries to form blocs centered around either Washington or Beijing.""We've shifted into a disordered multipolar world where everything is a weapon: energy, data, infrastructure, migration,""  said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell in December.""Geopolitics is the vital word, everything is geopolitics,"" he added. Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Balkans, Africa and the Asia-Pacific region have been arenas of competition for influence between powers like China, the EU, Russia and Turkey – be it through financing infrastructure projects or by striking deals on trade, military or diplomatic cooperation.The war on Ukraine has further shaken things up, weakening Russia's grip on former Soviet republics in Central Asia and opening a new role for Turkey as a mediator.""This  reorganization is real, but probably temporary,"" said Pierre Razoux, head of France-based think-tank FMES. ""Inevitably, the end of the war will leave Russia and Europe weakened and worn down, while the two big winners from this situation will be the US and China,"" he added.Real and potential challengesAlthough the end of the war is not yet in sight, Russian President Vladimir Putin apparently misjudged Ukraineâ€™s spirit of resistance and counted on breaking the unity within the European Union and NATO. So far, the EU, with some concessions to Hungaryâ€™s Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, who refuses to send weapons to Ukraine, has still managed to preserve unity and vote in sanctions.Regarding the dependence of a large number of EU members on Russian gas and oil, almost all of the countries found alternative sources of energy, albeit at significantly higher prices, which aggravate inflation.The Western stance towards Russia would be complicated if China decided to grant Russia military support. This would put Ukraine in a much more difficult position. The United States and the EU have openly warned Beijing not to do so.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Bulgaria's eurozone perspective,"According to EC Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, Bulgaria could join the eurozone in 2025. Macedonians score above the European average in terms of their foreign language skills. Slovenia presents plans on cooperation in criminal law to its EU colleagues.Dombrovskis: Bulgaria may join the euro area from 1 January 2025Sofia (BTA) – European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis visited Sofia for meetings with President Rumen Radev, acting Prime Minister Galab Donev and government ministers. Last week, Bulgaria had said it would not be ready to introduce the single European currency from 2024 because of its inability to meet inflation requirements.â€œA possible date for Bulgaria to join the eurozone is January 1, 2025. The inflation requirement is subject to assessment by the EC experts. This assessment shows that the requirement cannot be met. Bulgaria must also adopt important laws in the fight against money laundering,â€ said Dombrovskis.According to him, the first step to curb inflation is to calm energy prices. In Dombrovskiâ€™s words, this is a problem not only for Bulgaria but for the whole of Europe. Second are measures to support the economy. Fiscal policy must be stable, so support measures must be temporary and targeted, he added. (23 February)Macedonians speak more foreign languages than the European averageSkopje (MIA) – North Macedonia is above the European average in terms of foreign language skills. Accordingly, 68.3 percent of Macedonians speak a language other than their mother tongue.According to Eurostat data published by Euronews on the occasion of International Mother Language Day, about 65 percent of the population in Europe know at least one foreign language. By comparison, in the United States only about 20 percent of the adult population speak another language.There are considerable variations between the European regions. In the Nordic countries, a large percentage of people know at least two languages, while in Southern Europe this is not the case.In Great Britain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Romania, Albania, Hungary and Bulgaria, less than 50 percent of the people are multilingual. (23 February)Slovenia is preparing an international treaty on cooperation in criminal lawBrussels (STA) – Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon has presented an initiative to ministerial colleagues from other EU member states to sign an international treaty on cooperation in the field of criminal law. If signed, this would, among other things, enable cooperation in the prosecution of war crimes in Ukraine.The treaty aims to establish a mechanism for law enforcement authorities from EU member states and third countries to cooperate and exchange information more easily. It would allow cooperation in the prosecution and investigation of crimes against humanity, war crimes, other international crimes and genocide.""This shows that Slovenia has a very clear policy of investigating accountability, including when it comes to war crimes in Ukraine,"" Fajon said of Slovenia's participation in drafting the treaty. At the end of May, Slovenia will host an international conference on this initiative, which has so far been joined by 77 countries.At a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, Fajon also supported joint procurement of ammunition to be sent to Ukraine. Ukraine is facing a huge need for ammunition, especially artillery shells. (20 February)Germany appeals to China: Do not supply weapons to RussiaBrussels (dpa) – On the sidelines of an EU foreign ministersâ€™ meeting in Brussels on February 20, Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said that she had appealed to China not to supply Russia with weapons for its war against Ukraine. In talks with the Chinese delegation at the Munich Security Conference during the weekend, she had emphasized that China, as a member of the Security Council, was responsible for world peace. Baerbock added, ""Of course, this also means that China must not supply weapons – and that includes dual-use goods – to Russia. I have underlined this intensively in my talks.""The US government has recently expressed concern about possible arms deliveries from China to Russia. The US had information that China was ""considering providing lethal support"" to Russia, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on US television on 20 February. When asked what he meant by that, Blinken replied, ""weapons, primarily weapons."" Ammunition would also fall into this category, he added.Blinken had met with China's top foreign policy official Wang Yi at the Munich Security Conference. He said afterwards that he had made it clear to Wang that such assistance would pose a serious problem for US-China relations. Blinken stated that Chinese companies were already known to have supported Russia with ""non-lethal"" equipment. According to a report in the Wall Street Journal, these included, for example, commercial drones from manufacturer DJI. Such drones can be classified as so-called dual-use goods – meaning products that can be used for civilian and military purposes.

Biden did not trip down plane stairs arriving in Poland,"Social media users are claiming a video shows Joe Biden tumbling down the stairs as he disembarked from Air Force One upon arrival in Warsaw, Poland, on February 20, 2023. This is false; other footage shows the US president exiting the aircraft without incident and via a separate ramp, and the White House confirmed a different person fell.""BREAKING! Biden has landed in the Poland and already fell!"" says one February 21 tweet sharing the video, which shows an unidentified person spilling down the jetway attached to the rear of the plane.Screenshot from Twitter taken February 24, 2023The television footage was captured after Biden's jet touched down at Warsaw's Chopin Airport, according to Polish-language text in the lower third of the screen.The president, traveling to Poland on the heels of an unannounced trip to Kyiv, championed democracies worldwide and reaffirmed his support for Ukraine as he spoke in Warsaw days before the one-year anniversary of Russia's invasion.The same clip of a person falling appeared in similar posts on Twitter and other platforms -- such as Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Truth Social -- and in languages including French, Spanish, Russian and Dutch.The posts mocking Biden build on a narrative among his critics that the 80-year-old leader is physically incapable of holding office, recalling previous incidents in which he fell from his bicycle in 2022 and stumbled while boarding Air Force One in 2021.""Did Joe Biden fall down the stairs of Air Force One AGAIN when landing for his Ukraine visit?!""

Europe in brief: Von der Leyen reacts to migrant shipwreck near Italian coast,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen calls for renewed efforts on the migration and asylum pact, after a ship full of migrants sank near the coast of Italy. The EU adopts new sanctions against Russia and Iran. Bulgaria marks one year since the start of the war in Ukraine with marches in major cities.Von der Leyen after Crotone shipwreck: 'redouble efforts for migration pact'Brussels (ANSA) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has called for redoubling â€œour efforts on the Pact on Migration & Asylum and on the Action Plan on the Central Mediterranean"" after the tragic deaths of migrants that occurred off Steccato di Cutro in southern Italy. ""I am deeply saddened by the terrible shipwreck off the coast of Calabria. The resulting loss of life of innocent migrants is a tragedy,"" von der Leyen wrote in a tweet.So far, 59 bodies have been recovered and 80 people rescued. Twenty-one are in hospital, over 100 are presumed dead. The number of dead children is said to be around 20. The boat on which the migrants were traveling, a wooden sailing vessel that left four days ago from Turkey, broke in two because of the rough sea. At the end of 2020, the European Commission had presented a new pact on migration and asylum, including a common European framework for migration and asylum management as well as a crisis preparedness and response system (February 26).New EU sanctions over Ukraine war target 121 individuals and entitiesBrussels (AFP) – The European Union's new sanctions over the war in Ukraine target 121 individuals and entities, including Iranian drone manufacturers, the EU announced on Saturday.The successive round of EU measures are ""the most far-reaching sanctions ever – depleting Russia's war arsenal and biting deep into its economy,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. ""We are also turning up the pressure on those trying to circumvent our sanctions,"" she added.The latest package of EU sanctions targets an additional 96 Russian entities (companies or state agencies) including three Russian banks, an EU statement said.The package also covers seven Iranian entities, all of which are manufacturers of explosives drones used by Russia to strike Ukrainian targets, including infrastructure and residential buildings. (February 25)Marches in major Bulgarian cities to mark one year since the Russian invasion of UkraineSofia (BTA) – Marches in support of Ukraine took place in Sofia and many other Bulgarian cities to mark one year since the start of the war.In Sofia, the march began with chants of ""This is not Moscow"". Participants demanded that Russian Ambassador Eleonora Mitrofanova should be recalled from Bulgaria and that arms should be sent to Ukraine.President Rumen Radev will honor the Ambassador of Ukraine to Bulgaria, Vitaly Moskalenko, with The Madara Horseman Order – conferred on foreign and Bulgarian nationals with particularly big contributions to the establishment, as well as the strengthening and development of bilateral relations with Bulgaria – for the ambassador's dedicated work in the difficult conditions of the war against his country. The decoration is also awarded for Moskalenko's particularly great services to the deepening and expansion of bilateral relations between Bulgaria and Ukraine, the presidency said in a statement.The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) said that since the first day of the war it has consistently been demanding a policy of supporting diplomatic efforts to achieve peace, of refraining from providing arms to war parties, in favor of de-escalation and against imposing economic sanctions.The leader of the conservative GERB party Boyko Borissov stated that Bulgaria had to take sides in this aggression and this conflict. He pointed out that he had joined the demand of ""Democratic Bulgaria"", submitted three years ago, to dismantle the Soviet Army Monument in Sofia.Continue the Change Party, which is seen at first or second place by newest express polls before the parliamentary elections on April 2, promised to follow-up on Parliamentâ€™s decision to send more weapons to Kiyv. (February 24-27) All EU businesses and households to have high-speed internet by 2030Brussels (Belga) – The European Commission wants to make high-speed internet available to all households and businesses by 2030. On Thursday, European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton proposed a strategy.The existing European infrastructure is no longer sufficient to give citizens, businesses and governments smooth access to things like artificial intelligence (AI) or virtual reality, which are likely to play a bigger role in the future. This will require more bandwidth at higher speeds.Investing in that infrastructure for 'Gigabit connectivity' is expensive. The European Commission wants to lower the price tag for governments and network operators by amending a 2014 directive on the rollout of 5G and fiber optic networks. It would speed up the process by reducing red tape as much as possible. For instance, the Commission wants to digitize permit applications and facilitate consultation between local governments and network operators so that they can work together to build underlying infrastructure. According to Breton, cost savings of up to 70% are possible.The Commission also wants all new or substantially refurbished buildings to have fiber optic lines unless there are valid reasons not to install them, and the European Union's executive board is going to consult the sector on how to share the costs of rolling out 5G and broadband. ""The burden of these investments is increasingly heavy,"" Breton said at a press conference in Brussels on Thursday. This is â€œdue, among other things, to the low return on investment in the telecommunications sector, the rising cost of raw materials and the global geopolitical context,"" he added.According to financial news agency Bloomberg, the EU has long been thinking about making major streaming services such as Netflix or YouTube co-pay for telecom infrastructure rollouts. Telecom operators have been demanding this for years. (February 23)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

The Istanbul convention: Combatting violence against womenÂ ,"Femicides, domestic violence, cyber-stalking: the Istanbul Convention aims to prevent and eliminate violence against women. While some EU members and other European nations have ratified it, others have yet to agree.
On Tuesday, a week ahead of International Women's Day, the European Parliament once again urged the EU to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence as soon as possible. One in three women in the EU had already experienced physical or sexual violence, necessitating a swift ratification by the 27-country bloc, several MEPs said.Several of the countries that have already ratified the document also redefined their laws to protect women. Others still lack a national plan to implement the Convention.The Istanbul Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe, a non-EU organization monitoring human rights, in 2011. The ratification of the Convention needed 10 ratifications by 10 States. Of these 10 States which were first to ratify it, 8 were members of the Council of Europe. By signing it, the countries committed themselves to prevent, prosecute and eliminate violence against women. It entered into force on 1 August 2014 and was signed by the EU on 13 June 2017.Nearly six years after signing the Convention, the EU has still not ratified it, because six members – Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia – have refused to do so in the EU Council. However, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in 2021 that the EU could proceed with ratification even without unanimity.Poland, which ratified the Convention in 2015, is currently trying to revoke it, deeming it ""harmful"" because it requires schools to teach children about gender. Turkey withdrew from the Convention in 2021. Despite the war, Ukraine was able to ratify the Istanbul Convention, the first international treaty to set legally binding standards to prevent violence against women, last year.'Yes means yes': Progressive laws in Spain and SloveniaSlovenia and Spain have both ratified the Istanbul Convention (Spain in 2014, Slovenia in 2015) and even redefined the crimes of rape and sexual violence to adopt the ""yes means yes"" concept. This means that if a person does not clearly express their will to engage in sexual activity, this has to be considered as a ""no"". The new legislation, therefore, does not necessarily contemplate the use of force as a requirement to punish an aggression.According to a report by the European Womenâ€™s Lobby from 2020, Spain has improved in the field of prevention and prosecution of crimes against women since the ratification. The country increased financial support for affected women and created refuge centers.Complying with the guidelines of the Istanbul Convention, Spain also became the first country in the European Union to officially record all types of femicides in 2022. Even so, the eradication of violence against women continues to be a challenge in Spain, where 49 women were killed by gender-based violence last year.The Spanish Minister of Equality, Irene Montero, during the closing ceremony of the International Feminist Meeting organized by the Ministry of Equality, with a panel of leading women from different corners of the world, at the Faculty of Medicine of the Complutense University of Madrid. Photo: EFE/ Borja SÃ¡nchez TrilloSlovenia has had no major problems complying with the Convention, when in mid-2020 the Polish government started to examine the possibility to withdraw from the Convention, the Slovenian government at that time saw no need to do so. According to the report for 2021 of the Council of Europe's Grevio Group of Experts, which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Convention, Slovenia had made progress in establishing a legal, institutional and policy framework.However, more attention should be paid to women from vulnerable groups and the improvement of data collection, and the criminal justice system should take stronger action against all forms of violence against women. Domestic violence against women increased significantly during the Covid 19 pandemic. In 2020, there were ten cases of femicide. According to the latest data, every fifth woman in Slovenia has experienced some form of violence.Germany lacks a national action planThe Istanbul Convention came into force in Germany on February 1, 2018. However, for the Convention to be implemented according to the guidelines, there is a shortage of thousands of women's shelter places.The latest Grevio report on Germany stated in October 2022 that there had been a lack of a national action plan so far, even though the Convention indicates one. Women's shelters and counseling centers are very unevenly distributed and there is a shortage of them in rural areas. In larger cities, there are often long waiting lists. The experts further called for a review mechanism to analyze all gender-based killings of women and to identify where institutions need to respond differently.However, the experts welcomed some developments in the German criminal law. This included, for example, the explicit criminalization of technology-based abuse such as cyber-stalking or the unauthorized photographing of intimate body parts.Italy: Resistance to gender topicsIn 2013, Italy was the fifth country to ratify the Istanbul Convention. According to the 2020 Grevio report, Italyâ€™s laws are in many cases â€œinnovativeâ€, but too often not implemented effectively and uniformly throughout the country. In addition, the report raised various concerns regarding gender equality, data collection in courts and custody cases after women became victims of domestic violence.Furthermore, the report states, the country must ""provide adequate financial and human resources"" to implement existing laws and policies. Policies should be coordinated and monitored ""between national, regional and local authorities."" In addition, the experts call for action in establishing basic and specialized services for female victims of violence, which should be accessible throughout the country.The Grevio report notes a â€œresistance regarding gender equalityâ€ in Italy. This has for example manifested itself in both schools and universities through a delegitimization of gender studies. Some cities have â€œcensoredâ€ events that were to be held in public libraries and aimed at raising awareness on gender issues.Croatia: Controversy over ratificationLike in other Central and Eastern European countries, the Istanbul Convention was divisive for Croatian society. Croatia signed the agreement on January 22, 2013, and the Croatian parliament, the Sabor, eventually ratified it on April 13, 2018. But the ratification shook the center-right ruling party Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ attempted to appease critics, within and outside the party, by including a statement in the law stating that the convention is consistent with the Constitution of the Republic of Croatia, and that it does not contain the so-called gender ideology. Opponents, mainly circles close to the Catholic Church, pointed out that the Istanbul Convention was being misused to introduce the so-called ""gender ideology"", i.e., the separation between gender and biological gender, into Croatian legislation, education, and the media. Others pointed out that science also distinguishes between sex and gender.Women's rights activists believe that the Istanbul Convention has been inadequately implemented in Croatia. At a roundtable discussion in the Croatian parliament last November, they said the system is inadequate because judges do not know what gender-based violence is. They were particularly critical of court procedures that impose symbolic sentences for domestic violence.Another problem is that women find it difficult to report an abusive partner, being afraid they will not be believed. If they decide to report, they often do so years after the fact when they file for a divorce, and are then often confronted with doubts as to whether any violence occurred at all. Psychological violence against women is also often not acknowledged.A delegation of the Council of Europe's Group of Experts on Action against Violence against Women and Domestic Violence (GREVIO) carried out an evaluation visit to Croatia from 17 to 21 October 2022.GREVIO plans to publish its evaluation report on Croatia during 2023.Bulgaria: Pushing for laws against domestic violence without ratificationIn 2018, Bulgaria's Constitutional Court adopted a decision stating that the Istanbul Convention advances legal concepts related to the notion of gender that are incompatible with the fundamental principles of the Bulgarian Constitution. In line with this decision, Bulgaria did not support the two draft Council decisions on EU ratification of the Istanbul Convention, by which the Council seeks the consent of the European Parliament, the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) explained earlier in February.The Bulgarian government and civil society were working actively to prevent forms of violence against women and provide protection and support to the victims, the MFA added. Last December, the Bulgarian Ministry of the Interior said that a total of 3,085 protection orders had been issued under the Protection Against Domestic Violence Act between January 1 and October 31 of 2022. In these 10 months 2,656 women, 349 men and 873 children were victims of domestic violence, perpetrated by 2,713 men and 283 women.In November, the Bulgarian Justice Ministry presented a draft bill with amendments to the Protection Against Domestic Violence Act, envisaging the creation of a national information system and a national register of domestic violence cases.Bosnia and Herzegovina: Every fourth women victim of domestic violenceBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) was among the first countries in Europe to ratify the Istanbul Convention in 2013. However, the convention has not been fully incorporated into the countryâ€™s legal framework, even though some parts are included in entity laws.The Agency for Gender Equality of BiH is responsible for the implementation of the Convention and for ensuring that there is a uniform system of prevention and protection of victims of violence, without discrimination based on which entity, canton or municipality the victims live in. BiH suffers the consequences of the constitutional division of the countryâ€™s jurisdiction. This results in different practices, causing inequality in the implementation of the right to protection, but also in the availability of help and support for the victims.According to a report by the Gender Equality agency of BiH, every fourth woman in BiH is a victim of domestic violence. Increasingly, violent behavior ends in femicides, without being legally recognized as such. In total, one in two women over the age of 15 have experienced some form of physical, psychological or sexual violence.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: EU plans to deliver 1 billion euros worth of ammunition to Ukraine,"EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell urges EU countries to deliver 1 billion euros worth of ammunition to Ukraine. Bosnia and Herzegovina officially started an EU test project for the introduction of new technologies in the electoral process. Germanyâ€™s minister for foreign affairs Annalena Baerbock envisions a transformation to feminist foreign policy in her country.Borrell calls on EU countries to 'urgently' deliver 1 billion euros worth of ammunition to UkraineBrussels (Belga) – Following a European leaders' pledge to Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to speed up their arms deliveries, EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell called on EU countries to ""urgently"" deliver the ammunition requested by the Ukrainians. In a document from Borrell seen by AFP, he called for 1 billion euros from the European Peace Facility to be spent on buying 155 mm grenades for the Ukrainian army this month.If the 1 billion euros were released, then the Ukrainian army could soon be supplied with 250,000 shells from EU member states' stocks, Brussels stated.The foreign representative called on EU countries to draw from their strategic stocks. ""We must quickly mobilize the resources at our disposal and we have to make do with what we have,"" Borrell said at a joint press conference with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmitro Koeleba on 21 February.EU defense ministers will discuss Borrell's proposal at an informal council of ministers of defense in Stockholm on 7 March.The EU took the historic decision to release funds for arms supplies to Ukraine immediately after the Russian invasion on 24 February of last year. Total European financial aid currently amounts to 3.6 billion euros. The money is taken from the European Peace Facility (EPF), an off-budget fund set up in 2021 to finance European foreign policy operations. Originally, the fund had a budget of 5.7 billion euros for the period until 2027, but late last year Member States decided to raise the budget by 2 billion euros.The money is used to reimburse member states for supplies of arms and ammunition from their stockpiles. In his proposal, Borrell suggests granting ""a favorable reimbursement rate, up to 90 per cent,"" if the ammunition is delivered before a certain date. (March 1)BiH starts EU project for testing new technologies in the election processSarajevo (FENA) – The European Union's test project for the introduction of new technologies in the electoral process in Bosnia and Herzegovina was officially launched in the Central Election Commission (CEC) of BiH. CEC President Suad ArnautoviÄ‡ and the EU's Special Representative in BiH Johann Sattler emphasized that the project includes an electronic system for the identification of voters and faster transmission of election results from polling stations.The project will be implemented at 165 polling stations in 10 municipalities/cities that have been selected for testing the electronic voter identification system, the online entry system and the quick transfer of election results from the polling station to the CEC. This is the first time that digital technologies are being tested at polling stations.The EU's Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Johann Sattler, said that the project provided an opportunity to test new technologies for the first time in terms of voter identification and vote counting.â€œIts primary purpose is to test voter identification tools and secure communication of counted votes. The total value of this project is almost 700,000 euros,"" added Sattler.The Agency for Identification Documents, Records and Data Exchange (IDDEEA) will provide all the infrastructure for the implementation of the project, and stated that the efforts of the responsible institutions to introduce new technologies into the electoral process were innovative. (March 1)Baerbock: guidelines and an ambassador for feminist foreign policyBerlin (dpa) – An 80-page catalogue full of guidelines and her own ambassador: Germany's Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock wants to anchor the concept of feminist foreign policy as a working principle in the Federal Foreign Office. ""Women's rights are an indicator of the state of our societies,"" writes the Green politician in the foreword to the guidelines, which are to be presented in Berlin on 1 March. The concept is also to be applied to project funding and humanitarian aid.Baerbock wants to present the new approaches together with Development Minister Svenja Schulze after the cabinet meeting. ""We are pursuing a feminist foreign policy because it is sorely needed and because men and women are still not equal worldwide,"" Baerbock said, explaining the new approach. It is not about ""foreign policy for women, but for all members of a society."" Minister Schulze wants to present a separate concept for feminist development policy. She wants more than 90 per cent of the newly committed project funds to flow into projects that promote gender equality by 2025. The concept of feminist development policy is to be anchored in cooperation with partner countries. At least 50 per cent of the leadership positions in the development ministry are to be filled by women.Baerbock wants to name ""historically grown power structuresâ€ to overcome them and thus â€œpromote fair participation and equality for all people worldwide."" In addition, she wants to create the post of a ""Foreign Office ambassador for feminist foreign policy"" from the summer onwards, primarily to work internally. ""We will work hard to give our Foreign Service a more feminine face and increase the proportion of women in leadership positions,"" she announced. According to the Federal Foreign Office, 49.8 percent of its employees are currently women. 27 percent of the 226 German missions abroad are headed by women. (February 28)Kosovo and Serbia still have a long way to go after Brussels agreementBrussels (ANSA) – During a meeting with EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Josep Borrell, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ and Kosovan Prime Minister Albin Kurti agreed that no further discussions were needed on the EU's proposed agreement to normalize relations between the two countries. ""We have made some progress, but more work is needed,"" Borrell commented, announcing a new meeting in March to â€œfinalize discussions on the implementation annex,â€ an integral part of the agreement.The proposal was presented to the parties last September and is supported by the 27 EU Member States – as stated in the European Council conclusions of 9 February – and the United States. Italy, France and Germany played a leading role in the negotiations. This was demonstrated most recently by a letter sent by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron on the eve of the meeting in Brussels, asking VuÄiÄ‡ and Kurti to support the proposal. The text includes several elements that constitute a de facto recognition of Kosovo by Serbia.VuÄiÄ‡ spoke of a â€œdifficult meetingâ€ with Kurti and European mediators Josep Borrell and Miroslav Lajcak. In statements made at the end of the meeting, he said he believed more meetings would be needed in the future to make progress. The first, he added, would take place on 18 March in North Macedonia on the sidelines of a mission by Borrell to the region. ""Today in Brussels, we both agreed on the EU proposal supported by Germany, France, Italy and the United States without changes. I offered to sign formally, but Serbia was not ready. Negotiations on implementation will follow soon,â€ Kurti wrote, thanking Borrell and Lajcak. (February 27)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

France's 'Label Rouge' scrapped by the European Commission? Beware of these misleading claims,"No, the ""Label Rouge"" seal of quality for poultry in France will not be abolished by the European Union. Yet, online articles and commentators claim that the European Commission wants to do away with the French label in future regulation. In reality, this sign of quality assurance, which notably rewards free-range farming, is in no danger of disappearing, as explained by the European Commission and several poultry farming unions. Even so, with negotiations over the future European regulation still under way, Label Rouge poultry farmers had expressed concerns of a potential relaxation of labelling standards, which in their view ran the risk of ""confusing the consumer"". The concerns were taken into account in a new draft of the regulation made public on February 22, which protects the ""traditional free range"" label designation. Since 2021, a negotiation process has been under way at the European Union level to update poultry marketing standards within the EU as well as production method indications on poultry labels, such as the ""traditional free range"" designation.When an initial version of the new EU regulation was made public in January 2023, several online websites and political figures responded, arguing that the changes would spell the end of Label Rouge standards or ""abolish mentions of the poultry farming method"", as claimed by The Epoch Times, a website with a history of spreading unsubstantiated theories.""Good chicken's over!"", journalist Andre Bercoff claimed on Sud Radio on February 9. ""No more labelling: you'll have a choice between Romanian or Bulgarian industrial chicken, marked as free-range. And Label Rouge is over. That's Europe for you. We'll be forced to eat whatever without knowing what we're consuming.""The matter also drew a response from the president of the National Rally (RN), Jordan Bardella: in a video posted to Twitter on February 15 and shared nearly 3,000 times, the MEP claimed that the European Union ""is threatening the high-quality French poultry sector by wanting to abolish the standards that define the Label Rouge"". Label Rouge not affectedFrance's chicken sector has indeed shared its concerns since January that there would be a ""liberalisation"" of poultry labelling. In a statement released on January 25, the French poultry industry group Anvol warned of a threat ""to the production of traditional free-range poultry and to the truth and clarity of consumer information.""However, these concerns have at times been misinterpreted, as the Label Rouge itself is not under threat. The various standards and specifications regarding French and European labels -- like the Label Rouge or the AOP (Protected Designation of Origin, PDO) of Bresse Poultry -- are not affected by the planned European changes. ""These unfounded fears are in fact a matter of mixing up two different things,"" said Adina Revol, spokeswoman for the European Commission's French representation. ""First, there's the issue of quality labels (Label Rouge and AOP in this case, but also IPG (Protected Geographical Indication, PGI) for example). There is absolutely no question of abolishing them, nor of rendering them meaningless,"" she told AFP on February 17.  ""Then there's the matter of promoting production methods, and in particular of the mentions that can appear on poultry sold within the European market,"" she added. For their poultry to receive France's Label Rouge -- which was started in 1960 -- farmers must fulfil a number of criteria relating to poultry feed, as well as the farming method. Label Rouge chickens are for example birds raised in the traditional free-range method (a minimum of two square metres of outdoor space per chicken) or in total freedom (without coops). Chicken farmers as a whole also confirm that the Label Rouge is not at stake. ""We have never spoken of abolishing Label Rouge standards,"" Anvol director Yann Nedelec told AFP on February 17. Ditto for Gilles Huttepain, president of the Federation of Poultry Industries (FIA), who confirmed that Anvol had ""never said that the Commission wanted to abolish the Label Rouge"" during a press conference on February 22. Red Label poultry (Photo AFP / Christophe SIMON)'Liberalised' labelling in the first version of the regulation?Yet, Label Rouge poultry farmers did warn of a ""long-term"" threat to their farms from what they describe as ""unfair competition"".  Since late January, they have been concerned that the regulation currently under discussion will affect the existing rules on what additional criteria farmers can add to their labels to indicate the production method. Indeed, in addition to pre-existing labels (Label Rouge, AOP...), EU regulation has since 2008 set out a list of five terms that refer to the particular characteristics of the farming method (see below), each based on precise criteria. Article 11 of the present regulation dated 2008, listing the 5 facultative and exclusive denominations concerning the methods of poultry production. (Screenshot taken on February 23, 2023)A farmer can therefore indicate how the chicken was raised, if he so chooses, as long as it is in accordance with the precise label nomenclature. Indoor chicken farmers can for example specify that their poultry was raised in an ""extensive indoor"" system, while Label Rouge farmers can explicitly say that their chicken was raised using the ""traditional free range"" method or in ""total freedom"". These optional terms are exhaustive: no other description of the farming method can be used on labels of chicken sold in the European Union. But in late January, French chicken farmers argued that the proposed regulation would de facto abolish the exclusive nature of the nomenclature. According to them, this would allow other farmers to include other -- less stringent -- terms, which would result in confusing the consumer. Anvol provided as examples potential terms like ""Field chicken"" and ""Open-air chicken"". According to the French farmers, this would enable, say, German or Dutch farmers to include terms that would enhance their indoor farming methods in the eyes of the consumer. This was notably expressed by Bernard Tauzia, president of the National Union of Poultry Labels of France (Synalaf), during a press conference on February 22. This would ""undermine good consumer information and the development of alternative"" poultry production, according to Synalaf. Anvol, which notably represents Label Rouge chicken farmers, denounced the Commission's desire to ""abolish standards allowing consumers to clearly identify poultry production methods thanks to the five set terms allowed to date"" but also its willingness to open the floodgates to a ""forest of terms"" that could confuse the consumer, as expressed by Gilles Huttepain during a press conference on February 22. Labelling 'deregulation' or the 'enhancement of other factors linked to animal welfare'?The first version of the new regulation -- the one released in January 2023 -- does indeed appear less stringent compared to existing rules: while article 11 of the 2008 regulation made the five terms exclusive, clearly indicating that ""no other terms"" could appear on the label (below left), this notion of exclusivity no longer appears in article 10 of the initial version of the new regulation (below right). Article 11 of the present regulation dated 2008, listing the 5 facultative and exclusive denominations concerning the methods of poultry production.(Screenshot taken on February 23, 2023)Article 10 of the first version of the future regulation concerning the poultry denominations (Screenshot taken on February 23, 2023 / Nathan GALLO)   The National Institute for Origin and Quality (INAO), in charge of labels and appellations in France, also told AFP on February 16 that these changes could have the effect of ""relaxing the labelling system by allowing the use of other terms besides the optional reserved terms, which could pose an issue vis-a-vis the limited number of terms currently used on Label Rouge products"". It noted however that the matter was still under discussion. Questioned on the subject at the senate, Agriculture Minister Marc Fesneau expressed his reservations regarding the regulation proposed in January: ""There's the risk of deceiving consumers, and also the risk that the traditional free-range and Label Rouge sectors will no longer be as esteemed."" Contacted by AFP, the ministry confirmed on February 24 that this ""deregulation of the use of valorising terms for labelling poultry meat which to date had been limited to a closed list of five valorising terms would have allowed a coexistence on the European market of valorising terms defined at the European level with terms not regulated by European rules but using words or notions related to those regulated at the European level"". It also pointed to the risk of ""unfair competition"" from other poultry in countries whose farming methods are often considered less virtuous by the consumer. The European Commission addressed these concerns in an article published to the website of its French representation on February 14. It explained that, ""the discussions with member state representatives revolve around permitting other terms in addition to the five present since 2008 by allowing farmers to promote other factors related to the poultry production method, notably those involving animal welfare, and by informing the consumer of the contents of the information in a transparent manner.""""Other additional appellations could thus be worth authorising and that is the subject of discussion in the same vein of informing consumers in a trustworthy manner and protecting farmers who embark on this path,"" Adina Revol told AFP on February 16. ""Deceiving consumers with ambiguous or vague terms will continue to be absolutely forbidden"". The Commission had moreover responded to the French farmers that if new terms ""were to be proposed by farmers, they would have to be accompanied by precise criteria"" and would be subject to regular checks. A new version of the text published on February 22 that 'satisfies' farmersThe pushback from farmers and the ministry of agriculture appear to have shifted the lines, as the latest version of the future regulation, published on February 22, again mentions the exclusivity of terms, but only regarding outdoor farming. The new regulation provides in effect that the ""only terms that can be used to designate products from livestock raised outdoors"" are ""free range"", ""traditional free range"" and ""free range -- total freedom"", or in large part the same ones as those used by the French Label Rouge. Latest version of the article 10 of the future regulation, published on February 2023 (Screenshot taken on February 23, 2023)  These modifications appear to have satisfied Label Rouge farmers. During a press conference held by Anvol on February 22, the ""compromise"" was hailed across the board. During a follow-up with AFP on February 24, Anvol director Yann Nedelec said he was ""satisfied with the Commission's proposal, which protects the valorising terms of traditional free range or free range chicken.""Like the farmers, the ministry said it wanted to be ""careful"" regarding a matter that is still under discussion, though it told AFP that it was satisfied with a compromise that ""protects and maintains the exclusivity of the use of the 'free-range' terms.â€ ""The draft text still needs to pass through several steps before its publication in a couple of weeks.""15% of French poultry production certified as Label RougeThe share of chickens raised in either total freedom or in the traditional free-range manner in France is one of Europe's largest, with 19 percent of poultry raised with access to the outdoors, against just 1 percent in Germany or the Netherlands. In 2021, 17 percent of France's poultry production displayed the words ""free-range chicken"" on their labels -- 15 percent of them Label Rouge and 2 percent bio. Hence the great interest in France, with Anvol declaring in its press statement that French farmers were ""the most affected by the labelling changes"".Nathan GALLOTous ses articlesAFP FranceTous ses articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: European Commission hails UN Treaty of the High Seas,"The European Commission welcomes the UN deal to protect international waters, which was closed last weekend after 15 years of negotiations. The EU, with the support of France, plans to launch a humanitarian airlift to eastern Congo. European Commissioner for Values and Transparency Vera JourovÃ¡ emphasizes the need for quality media in Slovenia. European Commission welcomes 'historic' treaty on oceansNew York (Belga) – The European Commission called the UN treaty on the protection of the high seas ""a historic moment for our oceans."" An internationally binding agreement had been under discussion for 15 years.After a marathon session of nearly 40 hours, overnight from Saturday to Sunday, United Nations member states agreed on the Treaty of the High Seas. The accord, among other things, aims to protect international waters, some two-thirds of the oceansâ€™ surface. Currently, only 1 percent of international waters enjoy protected status.""We take a crucial step forward to preserve the marine life and biodiversity that are essential for us and the generations to come,â€ said European Commissioner for Environment and Oceans Virginijus SinkeviÄius. He added that this day was the culmination of more than a decade of preparatory work and international negotiations, in which the EU had played a key role.During the talks on the final text of the agreement in New York, the European Union pledged 40 billion euros to contribute to the further management and implementation of the agreement. Earlier that week, at the Our Ocean conference in Panama, the EU had already announced 860 million dollars (more than 800 million euros) to be invested in ocean research, monitoring and conservation by 2023. (March 5)Conflict in Democratic Republic of Congo: EU announces humanitarian airlift to GomaBrussels (AFP) – On Saturday, the European Union announced the establishment of a humanitarian airlift to Goma, with the support of France, to help people in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) who are plagued by armed groups.The airlift will be put in place ""quickly"" and will allow the delivery of â€œhumanitarian aid in the form of medical and food products as well as a series of other emergency products, in collaboration with UNICEF and other humanitarian partners,"" said a statement from the European Commission.The province of North Kivu, in eastern DRC, is affected by the resurgence of the M23 rebellion – a group of fighters of mostly Tutsi ethnicity, an ethnic group of the African Great Lakes region in which Congo and Rwanda are located.The announcement came during a visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo by French President Emmanuel Macron, who is trying to achieve de-escalation in the east of the country, but whose peace efforts are being challenged in Kinshasa. (March 4)Jourova: Slovenia needs quality public mediaLjubljana (STA) – Slovenia needs quality public service media with stable funding, European Commission Vice-President Vera JourovÃ¡ stressed on Thursday. As an important public source of unbiased information, public service media face a number of challenges, such as securing independent funding and maintaining high editorial standards.The importance of independent public media with stable funding, is also underlined by the Freedom of the Media Act, said JourovÃ¡. During her two-day visit to Slovenia, she met with representatives of all three branches of government.The discussions focused on the situation of the Slovenian media, in particular public broadcaster RTV Slovenia (RTVS). JourovÃ¡ said that she noticed hopes that the Constitutional Court would rule soon on the constitutionality of the amendment to the RTVS Act.Last July, the National Assembly adopted the amendment, through which the government sought to depoliticize RTVS, following changes the previous government made. Several RTVS top managers filed a petition for a constitutional review.The Constitutional Court suspended the implementation of part of the amendment to the RTVS Act concerning the broadcasterâ€™s management in February. A final ruling on the constitutionality of the amendment is now awaited.On Thursday, JourovÃ¡ also took part in a debate on free media as a bulwark against disinformation in times of war. Disinformation has become part of hybrid warfare, and free and independent media are crucial in the fight against its spread. This was one of the key points of the debate, which was also attended by President Pirc Musar and Ukrainian Ambassador to Slovenia Andriy Taran. (March 2)Unsustainable system: Bosnia and Herzegovina faces pension crisisMostar (FENA) – In the years ahead, Bosnia and Herzegovina will face serious challenges in terms of the sustainability of its pension and health system, demographer Aleksandar ÄŒaviÄ‡ said in an interview with FENA.Compared to the last population count in 2013, BiH has about 100,000 fewer inhabitants today, based only on the natural population movement. When it comes to migration, at least 25,000 people leave BiH annually, which is an optimistic estimate.""Given that we don't have statistics on external migration, we get these figures through Eurostat data on the number of immigrants to European Union countries, through data from diplomatic and consular missions of other countries in BiH and through non-governmental sector research,"" ÄŒaviÄ‡ explained.Data on the natural movement of the population and external migration indicate that, in the last ten years, BiH has lost at least 350,000 inhabitants. Some estimates are as high as half a million fewer inhabitants compared to the 2013 census.Data from the United Nations Population Fund show that by 2070, the number of people living in Bosnia and Herzegovina could drop to 1.56 million, or to 1.2 million according to pessimistic estimates. ÄŒaviÄ‡ believes that these data are alarming, not only because of population figures in themselves, but also because of the consequences this will have for the structure of the population.Although ten years have passed since the last census, it is doubtful if one will be held this year, given that no money has been allocated in the state budget – and for that a special law needs to be passed. The Ministry of Finance and Treasury of Bosnia and Herzegovina told FENA that funds for a census were not part of the budget request.

European countries at odds over the end of the combustion engine,"A vote on the EUâ€™s de facto sales ban for combustion engine cars has been postponed in the Council of the EU after several nations cast doubt on the decision, thereby unsettling part of the EUâ€™s package to tackle climate change.Considering that EU Member States and the European Parliament had already reached consensus on a sales ban for new combustion engine vehicles from 2035 in October of last year, a vote in the Council of the EU originally scheduled for Tuesday seemed to be a mere formality. Instead, demands made mainly by the German government to exempt engines using synthetic (e-)fuels from the regulation compromised the formal decision.Synthetic fuels are produced by combining hydrogen with carbon dioxide and the result of their combustion can be captured from the atmosphere. These fuels are only considered climate-neutral if the power needed to produce them and their components is generated from renewable sources.In addition to Germany, countries such as Italy, Poland, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic recently also voiced opposition to the plans for a sales ban. With Poland already opposed to the regulation, and Bulgaria opting to abstain, those countries could form a blocking minority within the Council.To approve it, 15 out of the EU's 27 Member States, making up at least 65 percent of the EUâ€™s total population, would have to vote in favor of the ban. Germany is the most populous EU country, while Italy is ranked third and Poland fifth. Without Germany's backing, the achievement of a majority representing 65 percent of the EU's citizens was unlikely, prompting the postponement of the vote.The plans to reduce climate-damaging CO2 emissions from new vans and cars by 100 percent by 2035 are part of a larger package to tackle climate change – the so-called Fit for 55 package, which in turn is part of the European Green Deal. The EU wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.Germany not on board without e-fuel exemptionGerman Transport Minister Volker Wissing voiced opposition to the sales ban last week, threatening that Berlin would not back it. He argued that the European Commission had not yet followed up with a complementary draft bill on how cars and vans running on climate-neutral fuels could still be registered in the EU after 2035.After a cabinet meeting, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said that the federal government was in agreement that it expected the European Commission to make a proposal on how such e-fuels could be used after 2035.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that newly registered combustion vehicles should be an exception to the ban after 2035. ""We need this legally secure, clear link between the decision on fleet limits and the possibility of new registrations,"" Lindner said. As the combustion engine technology would continue to remain important throughout the world, a car exporter like Germany should retain the expertise needed in this area, he added. He stated that for his party, the liberal FDP, technological openness was a high priority.Italy and Poland underpin the blockadeItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hailed the decision to postpone the EU vote on a proposed end to the sale of carbon-emitting petrol and diesel cars from 2035 as â€œan Italian success.â€ She said the position of the Italian government â€œis clear: a fair, sustainable transition must be planned and carried out with care in order to avoid negative repercussions in terms of production and employment.â€ Meloni continued to state that â€œit is right to aim for zero CO2 emissions as soon as possible, but states must be left free to take the path that they consider most effective and sustainable. That means not closing the door to paths for clean technologies that are different from electric [vehicles].â€In a statement sent to the representatives of the 27 EU Member States regarding the ban, Italy stressed that â€œby setting an emissions reduction target of 100 percent by 2035 and providing no incentive for the use of renewable fuels, the regulation is not in line with the principle of technological neutrality.â€ Furthermore, the document stated that â€œcombustion engine cars are owned by low-income citizens and will remain on the road beyond 2035. The success of electric cars will depend a lot on how affordable they become for these citizens.""Poland is also among the Member States that have raised objections to the ban.  â€œWe have been from the beginning and we are invariably against the ban on the sale of combustion cars after 2035,â€ said the Polish Minister of Climate and Environment, Anna Moskwa, who participated in a conference on photovoltaics in Brussels, reported on by Polish Press Agency (PAP).""There are more and more skeptical voices in the behind-the-scenes discussions. States wake up and calculate that 2035 is not that far away. Especially those smaller countries, which, as you can imagine, will be flooded with foreign technologies. Their societies are beginning to understand this reality, understand the consequences for themselves,"" Moskwa said during a meeting with journalists, PAP reported.France, Croatia and Slovenia uphold the banOn Wednesday, French Minister of Transport ClÃ©ment Beaune urged Germany to support a ban on the sale of new cars with internal combustion engines in the European Union by 2035, regretting a ""form of rebellion"" from Berlin.""If we do not keep this ambition we will be swept away industrially and ecologically,â€ Beaune stated. â€œIt is not by giving counter-signals that we will succeed in creating the electric car accessible to all,â€ the minister added. ""The signal was clear: it had been supported, including by Germany. It had been adopted under the French presidency of the European Union as a great ambition,â€ Beaune emphasized.Croatia supports the regulation for the ban, considering it an important part of the European Green Deal and one of the key intermediate steps for achieving climate neutrality by 2050.Although Croatia does not have a strong auto industry like the Czech Republic, Slovakia or Hungary, the company Rimac Automobili has emerged on the scene in recent years and has become world-famous with the development of an electric sports car. Rimac managed to attract investments from Hyundai and Porsche. Moreover, there is a joint venture between Rimac and Bugatti.Slovenia is also part of the group of member states that support the regulation for the ban. According to the Slovenian Ministry of the environment, climate and energy, the ban will contribute to achieving climate, energy and environmental objectives in the transport sector, so Slovenia has not changed its position.The ministry also highlights that, under the new regulation, the European Commission will monitor the development and deployment of zero-emission mobility technologies and infrastructure in the context of regular reviews. If necessary, the European Commission would be able to justify the need to continue selling synthetic fuel driven, zero-carbon internal combustion vehicles as part of those reviews, the ministry believes. In its opinion there are several pathways to the decarbonization of passenger cars, and the ministry is â€œnot opposed to leaving the door open to such a solution.â€Bosnia and Herzegovina making efforts for the futureEven though there is no unified state policy for the gradual transition to the use of electric and hybrid cars and the phasing out of petrol and diesel vehicles, the government of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina has recognized this trend and has approved incentives for a number of buyers to purchase electric cars. The number of such vehicles in Bosnia and Herzegovina is increasing, although the figures are significantly lower compared to European Union countries and the surrounding region.Car manufacturers are increasingly turning to hybrid and electric cars. They are aware of the need to introduce these vehicles in Bosnia and Herzegovina, especially since its capital is often one of the most polluted cities in the world. This is also demonstrated by a team of young engineers gathered in the company GS-TMT, driven by the idea of green energy, who have created the first electric delivery vehicle manufactured in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is called EVO.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: European Commission warns of new excessive budget deficit procedures starting in 2024,"European rules oblige member states to keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of GDP. However, there was an exemption in place during the pandemic, which expires at the end of 2023. The EU states want to provide Ukraine with urgently needed artillery ammunition for the fight against Russia as quickly as possible. Austria will participate in an EU mission in Niger.Brussels (Belga) – European rules oblige member states to keep their budget deficit below 3 percent of their gross domestic product and their debt ratio below 60 percent. That rule has been on hold since the coronavirus outbreak in March 2020, but this so-called general escape clause expires at the end of this year. European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis warned that the European Commission would propose to reopen excessive budget deficit procedures, based on the budget outcomes for 2023 in the spring of next year.For Belgium, the Commission expects a deficit of 5.8 percent this year, and many other member states also have a high deficit. Is an avalanche of procedures to be expected then? ""We are not going to anticipate that now,"" Dombrovskis said at a press conference on March 8. ""The forecasts will be updated several more times in the period up to spring of next year. We are providing clarity so that member states can prepare,"" Dombrovskis added.Next spring will also see European and, in Belgium, federal and regional elections. The exact date has not been fixed yet, nor has the timing of the launch of any procedures. The vice-president did note that in case of the 2019 European elections, such politically delicate decisions had only been taken after the ballot.â€œOur focus should now be on improving debt sustainability,"" stressed the European Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis.For the Commission, it is already clear that the times of broad government support are coming to an end. Dombrovskis is thinking primarily about phasing out measures to compensate for high energy prices, starting with the least targeted and broadest measures. However, investments in the green and digital transition should remain intact. (March 8)Ukraine urges more money for ammunition supplies at EU meetingStockholm (dpa) – Ukrainian Defence Minister Olexiy Resnikov has described EU plans for new ammunition deliveries to his country as insufficient. Ukraine needs one million artillery shells and around 4 billion euros would probably have to be made available to acquire them, Resnikov said at an informal meeting with EU defence ministers in Sweden on March 8. The point, he said, was being able to launch further counteroffensives against the aggressors from Russia.In a discussion paper for the defence ministers' meeting near Stockholm, the EU Commission and EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell had previously proposed providing an additional approximately 1 billion euros for rapid ammunition deliveries to Ukraine. The money should make it possible to reimburse member states willing to deliver ammunition a significantly higher share of the costs from EU funds than has been the case to date. A reimbursement rate of up to 90 percent is under discussion; so far, it amounted to less than 50 percent in some cases. In addition, according to Borrell, another 1 billion euros could be made available for a project by EU states wanting to jointly procure ammunition through the EU.Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius stressed at the meeting that money was ""not the main problem."" For example, he said, there are many technical requirements for ammunition that no one can override, ""Therefore, the production of ammunition will always take time."" In the coming weeks and months, bottlenecks will have to be overcome. That's why the current focus must be on ""gathering and delivering stocks – whatever we can deliver, given our own defence and alliance capabilities,"" Pistorius said.Russian forces fire an average of between 600,000 and 1.8 million rounds of artillery ammunition per month, according to figures from an Estonian government background paper, while Ukraine fires only 60,000 to 210,000 rounds per month. The current production capacity of the European defence industry reportedly only amounts to 20,000 to 25,000 rounds per month. However, it is possible to expand to as many as 175,000 rounds per month, according to the report. Borrell stressed he was sorry to say this, but a war mentality had to be adopted. We are in a time of war, he said. (March 8)Austria to deploy up to ten soldiers for EU mission in NigerVienna (APA) – Austria will deploy up to ten members of its armed forces for the EU military partnership mission in Niger. In addition, the Council of Ministers decided on March 8 to provide up to 30 more soldiers for preparation and up to 20 more for air transport. The EU wants to provide stronger support to the West African country in its fight against terrorists, and thus stabilize the Sahel region.According to the EU, the mission, called EUMPM Niger, will, among other things, help set up a training center and a new communications and command support battalion. The mission is initially scheduled to last three years. Total EU costs are estimated at 27.3 million euros. Austria's participation in the EU mission is initially limited until 31 December 2024.Austrian Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner said in a statement: ""If we want to avert flight and illegal migration, we have to work preventively. And this is where Austria can make a valuable contribution in Niger to sustainably prevent terrorism and thus contain the danger to Europe and make a positive contribution to increased stability and resilience in the Sahel region.""According to the statement, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said the geopolitical environment had become harsher with the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. ""As the EU, we must not leave the field to other actors, but continue to show our colors. Austria's participation strengthens security in Niger, which at the same time means more security for Europe.â€ (March 8)Bulgarian journalists are increasingly being sued for defamation, Council of Europe reportsBrussels/Strasbourg (BTA) – Journalists and media representatives in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Italy, Poland and Serbia are increasingly being sued for defamation, according to a report by the Council of Europe's platform to promote the protection of journalism and the safety of journalists.""At least 20 defamation and other types of legal proceedings were documented against journalists in 2022, with hundreds of thousands of Euros sought in damages in the name of reputational harm,"" said the report. More and more similar proceedings have been initiated at the request of politicians, including government members, the document notes. Among the examples given are fines imposed for distributing a report, such as the decision against the Bulgarian site ""Mediapool"".""The 2022 Media Pluralism Monitor (â€¦) identified eleven of 32 European countries where media pluralism is at â€˜high riskâ€™"". According to the 2022 Media Pluralism Monitor, published by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, there are, in addition, 28 out of 32 countries where news media concentration constitutes a high risk. Turkey has the highest media concentration in Europe at 82 percent, followed by Albania (70 percent), Poland (67 percent), Hungary (66 percent) and Bulgaria (also 66 percent), the data show. (March 7)French official: Bosnia and Herzegovina should join the European Union as soon as possibleSarajevo (FENA) – The French Secretary of the Ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs Laurence Boone paid an official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). During her meetings with BiH officials, Boone stressed that BiH was part of the European family and it was very important for the country to join the EU as soon as possible.Boone's visit represents the continuity of French involvement in the Western Balkans in the context of the EU's approach and the granting of candidate status to Bosnia and Herzegovina. She pointed out that there was an active civil society in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and citizens were working to promote democracy and the rule of law.During her visit, Boone encouraged the politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement fundamental reforms on the European road, as the goal of her visit was to remind of France's support in that process.Boone pointed out that France unequivocally gave full support to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and that it was committed to further assistance in all areas, especially in terms of EU integration.

"This European Union directive does not ""provide that"" owners of energy-intensive property be prevented from living in their homes","The European Union is currently working on a draft directive aimed at transforming the majority of existing residential buildings into zero-emission buildings by 2050. Since early February, internet users have claimed that this directive ""provides for the expropriation"" from 2030 of owners not carrying out the energy renovation work required to achieve this goal, by not allowing them to ""live in their own house or to rent it out"". In reality, the directive does not provide for any set penalty, as these are to be set out by the individual member states. A ban on renting out property that is too energy-intensive already exists in France, but owners can currently still live in the homes. In Belgium, the main penalties against owners reluctant to renovate are administrative fines and rent indexation bans. ""Private property will soon be a thing of the past in Europe?"", an internet user asks in this Twitter thread, which claims that ""the EU is currently working on a draft law that provides for the expropriation of owners of old residential buildings if they fail to meet new European energy efficiency standards. These buildings will lose their occupancy permits in 2030.""""Without compliance, you will not be allowed to live in your property or to rent it out,"" the internet user adds, sharing a three-minute video. In it, a man provides several sources meant to support this claim, with a caricature of European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen as his backdrop: ""Of course there is no true expropriation. You just no longer have the permission to live in your own house or to rent it out.""Screenshot taken on Facebook on February 28, 2023Screenshot taken on Twitter on February 28, 2023The same video was shared on Facebook and Telegram.In December 2021, the European Commission proposed a directive aimed at making European residential buildings -- with a few exceptions -- carbon neutral by 2050.Currently under negotiation among the various European bodies, this directive proposes several deadlines: as of 2030, all new buildings must be zero-emission and already existing residential buildings must have reached energy performance class F (based on a scale from A to G).Contrary to what these posts claim, the directive does not provide for any set penalty against owners who do not comply with the new energy efficiency standards. It is in fact a member state competence, several experts told AFP. It will be up to governments to set any potential penalties for owners reluctant to carry out the renovation work: at present Belgium mainly provides for administrative fines and a ban on rent indexation, whereas in France certain dwellings considered too energy-intensive can no longer be rented out since January 2023. The EU directive recommends that member states implement strong incentives and financial assistance in addition to those already existing to help owners renovate their property. What does the video say?The video, entitled ""7 years until expropriation: EU draft law threatens property owners!"", was first posted on January 24, 2023 to YouTube channel A.I. Financial, which shares many videos clearly made with the help of artificial intelligence that are supposed to reveal the secrets of the global elite. The channel's description says that it ""provides consolidated market and business information"" but adds the disclaimer: ""Don't make any investment or life decisions based on this content.""The video's description box includes a link to a European Parliament press release published on February 9, 2023. It announces the position of the parliament's Industry, Research and Energy Committee on the European Commission's proposed revision of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive. The Commission proposed the directive as part of the bloc's ""Fit for 55"" legislation, which aims to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030. Buildings pose a major challenge towards achieving this goal, as their construction, renovation, demolition and use account for 36 percent of Europe's emissions according to the Commission. As the European Council explains on its website, the European Commission would like all existing residential buildings to be transformed into zero emission buildings. These residential buildings should be renovated little by little to meet various energy performance levels, ending with carbon neutrality in 2050. Screenshot taken on the website of the Council of EU, on March 2d, 2023European measures for 2030 and 2050To achieve this goal, the European Commission would like to standardise energy performance scales, enabling the classification of buildings from A (zero emissions) to G, which would include the 15 percent worst-performing buildings in the national building stock. At present, these levels are not standardised across member states. The text of the revision of the directive on energy performance, which was proposed by the European Commission on December 15, 2021, is available here. The Commission proposes that existing residential buildings be renovated in such a way as to achieve a minimum energy performance class of F in 2030 and E in 2033. Members of the European Parliament are more demanding, as they set out that existing ""residential buildings would have to achieve at least energy performance class E by 2030, and D by 2033"". ""All measures needed to achieve these targets would be established by each member state in national renovation plans,"" the European Parliament's press release says. MEPs also provide for possible exceptions to the renovation requirement, including for places of worship, historic buildings or public social housing, ""where renovations would lead to rent increases that cannot be compensated by saving on energy bills"". The Parliament specifies that ""MEPs also want to allow member states to adjust the new targets in a limited share of buildings covered by the requirements depending on the economic and technical feasibility of the renovations and the availability of skilled workforce.""The draft text will be put to the vote at a plenary meeting -- the European Parliament's monthly assembly -- from March 13 to 16, 2023 and once approved, will serve as a basis for negotiations with the European Council before the European directive's final adoption.https://youtu.be/XrER97K9MgMThe European Commission's directive does not provide for banning property owners from renting out or living in their homesAn EU directive is a legislative act that sets out a goal that all member states must achieve. While mandatory, it is less constraining than a regulation as the individual countries are free to devise their own laws on how to reach these goals.In its proposal for a revision of the directive, the Commission explains that ""vulnerable households are particularly exposed to increasing energy prices as they spend a larger proportion of their budget on energy products. By reducing excessive energy bills, building renovation can lift people out of energy poverty and also prevent it.""The text recalls the importance of establishing financial incentives to encourage building owners to renovate, and specifies that governments must ensure ""that the financial incentives benefit both the owners and the tenants, in particular by providing rent support or by imposing caps on rent increases.""It mentions no ban on renting out or living in a non-renovated building, much less expropriation of an owner who does not comply with the European energy efficiency standards. ""Member states shall lay down the rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the national provisions adopted pursuant to this directive and shall take all measures necessary to ensure that they are implemented. The penalties provided for must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive,"" according to the European Commission. The European Parliament press release mentioned above also does not bring up the ""expropriation"" of owners or a ban on renting out or living in a non-renovated building. A spokesperson from the European Commission told AFP on February 23, 2023 that the draft directive ""currently under negotiation does not include any measure on the expropriation of houses"" and recalls that the goal is ""stepping up the renovation of existing buildings, particularly those with the worst energy performance, to improve the performance and efficiency of our buildings and bring down energy costs for citizens.""French PM Elisabeth Borne and the president of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels, on January 16, 2023 (Photo AFP/Kenzo TRIBOUILLARD)Asked about a potential ban on renting out or living in a non-renovated property, the spokesperson said that ""the Commission proposal provides flexibility to member states to establish measures to enforce the directive... It is up to member states to decide on the enforcement measures for those cases where the building does not reach the necessary level."" ""The current directive -- published in 2018 -- does not provide for the possibility of expropriation or a rental ban for owners who refuse to comply with the energy efficiency standards,"" said Ulrike Beuselinck, a lawyer specialising in real estate law and the author of an article on the matter. ""In any event this would violate article 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights which guarantees respect for private life and one's home,"" she told AFP. However, according to this same article 8, national authorities can ""provide for a restriction on the right, if it is enshrined in law and is a necessary measure,"" she said on February 27, 2023. ""The future transposition of this new directive should not call into question the system currently in place"" via the 2018 directive, she added. ""Construction remains a national competence. It is therefore up to member states to establish these renovation requirements,"" said Camille Defard, head of the energy centre at the Jacques Delors Institute on February 17, 2023. ""There are no penalties at the European level, as they must be defined by the member states.""According to the expert, ""Ninety percent of European real estate needs to be renovated"" to meet the carbon neutrality goal set by European law. A ban on renting out energy-intensive housing exists in France, but not in BelgiumIn France, a renting ban on the most energy-intensive apartments since January 1, 2023In France, renting out property known as ""thermic colanders"" in French -- those most poorly insulated -- has been banned since January 1, 2023 for leases signed thereafter. This measure concerns dwellings considered the most energy-intensive, which consume more than 450KWh/m2 per year. Screenshot taken on the website of the French ministry of Ecological Transition, on February 28, 2023The rental prohibition will be gradually extended to buildings rated G in 2025, then F in 2028 and E in 2034. In January 2020, the French government introduced renovation assistance which can be requested by all owners wishing to renovate their property, regardless of revenue. Owners can also request an interest-free loan.In August 2022, there were 7.2 million homes in categories F and G, according to figures from the National Observatory for Energy Renovation (ONRE). ""The point of the renovations is also to improve the tenant's quality of life,"" said Camille Defard, adding that ""today, many low-income households are seeing their energy bills explode"". Despite the assistance, the cost, deadline and duration of the renovations have already led some owners to sell their properties, as the Le Monde newspaper reported in January 2023. Beyond these renting bans, the potential non-renovation penalties for owners once the directive is in place ""will be more along the lines of fines"", said Camille Defard, who describes any potential expropriation as ""absurd"". In Belgium, no ban on renting at the moment, just administrative finesIn 2020, Belgium adopted an economic recovery plan that incorporates the energy renovation of buildings. These renovations are being led by the Flemish, Walloon and Brussels governments, which provide for various kinds of aid and bonuses for owners who wish to renovate their property -- here in the case of Flanders, for example. In January 2023, the Flemish government introduced a renovation requirement for residential properties bought from 2023 onwards: ""All houses and apartments bought from 2023 onwards with class E or F must be renovated to class D or better within five years of the purchase,"" its website said. The energetic performance of buildings certificate (PEB) in Flanders. The class G does not exist in this region. Screenshot taken on the website of the Flemish government on March 1st, 2023Failure to comply with this requirement could result in an administrative fine of 500 to 20,000 euros (repeated for as long as the owner does not comply with the requirement), but the Flemish government's site mentions neither expropriation nor a ban on renting out or living in the property. In October 2022, the Flemish government implemented a one-year freeze on class E and F rental housing prices, which can therefore no longer be indexed. Since 2022, the Wallonia-Brussels region has been working with the European Union via different programmes to renovate its real estate. The website of the Public service of Wallonia mentions administrative fines in the event of non-compliance with regard to the PEB certificate -- which assesses the energy performance of a building -- but no ban on renting out or living in one's own home. The authorities can also refuse to issue a building or planning permit if the project does not satisfy the required energy efficiency standards; rent indexation is reduced for class D and E properties and banned altogether for class F properties. Since October 2022, the Brussels-Capital region has also banned rent indexation for category F and G housing.The energetic performance certificate in Wallonia. Screenshot taken on the website of the company Certinergie, on March 1st, 2023The issue of a rental prohibition for property considered too energy-intensive was discussed in the Walloon parliament in May 2022. In response to a member of parliament's query as to whether this kind of solution was being considered in Wallonia, Housing Minister Christophe Collignon said at the time that it would be ""interesting to take stock of the French measure following its implementation and, in particular, to examine whether it had not produced more adverse effects than positive ones"", surmising that the measure "" -- from reading the French press -- was disrupting the whole real estate market significantly"". ""This type of penalty is currently not in use in Belgium,"" said Ulrike Beuselinck, adding that ""the idea has not been rejected altogether but the will for now is not to 'punish' like in France"". ""It is still possible at this time to rent out accommodation with low energy efficiency in Belgium,"" Francois Soquet, responsible for EPB certificates at the Certinergie inspection body, told AFP. The Spiegel articleThe YouTube video from above also mentions an article in the German weekly Der Spiegel which reported on the draft directive a day after it was published, on December 15, 2021. The Spiegel does not mention expropriation or a ban on renting out or living in a building not in line with the new energy efficiency standards. It does however relay some criticism, including from the Haus&Grund association of German property owners, which said that ""renovation will not be an option for many buildings in energy classes F and G... For many private owners, the EU is putting an end to their dream of owning their own four walls.""Contacted by AFP on February 22, 2023,  Haus&Grund said ""the modernisations will be extremely expensive and overburden private owners,"" mentioning also the shortage of skilled workers qualified to carry out the renovations. As for penalties, in Germany, ""it will most likely amount to a compensatory levy in the event of non-compliance with the prescribed energy status. So there will be owners who will have to sell their properties at high losses if they cannot pay for the modernisation,"" the association said. The video concludes with a quote pulled from an editorial published on June 5, 2021 in the Canadian newspaper The National Post. The editorial itself does not mention the European directive on the energy renovation of buildings, which had yet to be proposed at the time. Marie GenriesTous ses articlesAFP BelgiqueTous ses articles Twitter EmailFollow usHemHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: The week of zero-emission economy proposals,"The European Commission presents new plans for industrial competitiveness, access to critical raw materials and the electricity market this week. The Council of Europe reports that Slovakia has failed to implement recommendations by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI). Austria and six other Schengen countries raise the alarm about the onward movement of migrants within the EU.EU to present its plans for the decarbonization technology raceBrussels (EFE) – This week, the European Commission will present its plans to increase industrial competitiveness, improve access to critical raw materials and reform its electricity market so that the European Union can compete with the United States and China in the technology race for the new zero-emission economy.The plans are unveiled after a joint announcement by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and US President Joe Biden on Friday, stating they would begin to negotiate a trade pact. The pact is to favor European companies that produce electric vehicles and will establish a ""transparent dialogue"" on the subsidies both sides are giving for green energy. Von der Leyen considered the meeting ""constructive"" and noted that they had managed to find solutions to the tensions that had marked the transatlantic relationship in recent months, following the approval in the US of the so-called Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).This Washington law, with its 340 billion euros in green subsidies to local production, was the trigger for the EUâ€™s industrial plan. Brussels wants to prevent companies from leaving the EU, who might be attracted by the massive aid and cheaper energy that other powers offer to a growing industry. With China planning to invest 260 billion euros over the next five years and Japan another 140 billion, initial estimates suggest that the EU should mobilize at least 350 billion for the sector. (March 12)Council of Europe anti-racist commission: Slovakia fails to implement 2020 recommendationsBrussels/Strasbourg (TASR) – On Friday, the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI), a human rights monitoring body, published a report on the implementation of the 2020 priority recommendations in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.In the case of Slovakia, ECRI concluded that the authorities had not yet implemented the recommendation to develop an action plan for people from the LGBTI community and only partially implemented the recommendation to provide compulsory pre-school education to young children, including in municipalities with a significant proportion of citizens of the Roma ethnicity.ECRI works within the Council of Europe (CoE), and in its conclusions point to the persistent delay in adopting an action plan and related legislation to strengthen equality for LGBTI persons. The anti-racist commission highlights that an attack took place on 12 October 2022 in Bratislava, which resulted in the death of two people from the LGBTI community. The attack was judged to be the result of the long-standing use of anti-LGBTI hate speech in the statements of politicians.In the case of the second recommendation, kindergarten attendance was made compulsory for all children in Slovakia over the age of five. ECRI stresses that Roma children nevertheless suffer from the consequences of insufficient kindergarten capacities, a lack of territorial coverage, understaffing and segregation, especially in smaller towns.In the case of the Czech Republic, ECRI found that the authorities had only partially implemented the recommendation to develop a national strategy to address areas of intolerance and discrimination against LGBTI persons and that they had not implemented the recommendation to desegregate Roma children in schools. The Czech authorities have already allocated financial resources to address this problem, but this has not brought about any substantial changes in practice.Both ECRI conclusions are based on government responses and information from other sources. They concern only priority recommendations and are not a comprehensive analysis of all developments in the movement against racism and intolerance. ECRI was established in 1994. Its aim is to counteract the growing problems of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and intolerance that threaten human and democratic values in Europe. (March 10)Austria: six other Schengen countries also concerned about migrant movementsBrussels (APA) – Austria and six other Schengen countries have expressed concerns about the onward movement of migrants within the EU. In a joint statement to the EU Council of Interior Ministers in Brussels on Thursday, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland called for ""effectively contain uncontrolled migration movements."" In particular, the countries expressed concern about the current status of the EU asylum system and the Dublin system.Under the Dublin system, the EU country where migrants enter the EU first would be responsible for asylum procedures. In practice, however, the system functions inadequately across the EU. ""The implementation of the Dublin rules has, especially in the context of increased arrivals to the Schengen area across all routes as well as challenges in the asylum systems of several Dublin States,become more and more complex and consequently inefficient in practice,"" the statement said.The signatories are committed to swift negotiations on reforming the EU asylum system, particularly regarding the Regulation on Asylum and Migration Management and the Asylum Procedures Directive. These negotiations should lead to ""a future-proof and workable system with clear criteria and balanced mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection,"" the statement said. (March 9)France: Macron's close aide to stand trial for embezzlement of EU fundsParis (AFP) – On Thursday, investigating judges in France ordered a trial against a pillar of the presidential majority and ten other people in a case of misappropriation of European public funds, AFP learned from a source close to the case.FranÃ§ois Bayrou, 71, who is close to President Emmanuel Macron, will have to answer for the alleged practices of MoDem, the centrist party he chairs and which is part of the presidential coalition in parliament.Bayrou and other MoDem officials are suspected of having used EU funds to hire parliamentary assistants who would have worked, at least partially, for the party between 2009 and 2014 instead of helping elected MEPs in the Strasbourg parliament in eastern France.Alongside Bayrou, other executives of the centrist party will be tried, including a former justice minister of ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy. This new legal case is likely to be embarrassing for Emmanuel Macron and his team. (March 9)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

Von der Leyen: Consumers to benefit from electricity market reform,"This week, the European Commission unveils its plans to reform the electricity market and boost Europe's competitiveness with a clean tech plan. The European Newsroom spoke with Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the proposal presentation. According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, consumers are the main beneficiaries of the reform of the European electricity market, which was proposed in Strasbourg on Tuesday. ""At the heart of this reform are consumers,"" von der Leyen said in an interview with agencies from the European Newsroom on Monday, adding that the proposed reform of the electricity market would ""drastically reduce the impact of gas prices on the price of electricity.""â€œA fundamental objective of the reform is to bring the benefit of the low cost of renewables to consumers,â€ von der Leyen stressed. The European Commission wants to reform the electricity market to prevent skyrocketing prices for consumers and promote the expansion of renewable energies. Electricity prices had risen extremely last year. One of the reasons for this was that at times around half of France's nuclear power plants were out of action. In addition, the rise in electricity prices was a result of much higher gas prices due to the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine.The head of the European Commission said that the â€œintraday [electricity] market works well, but we have to improve on long-term contracts.â€ Wholesale prices on the electricity market change from hour to hour, depending on supply and demand. At times of low demand, for example at night, prices are lower because electricity from renewable sources is sufficient to meet demand. And production costs from renewable sources are very low. In times of peak demand, however, the output of nuclear plants, coal-fired thermal power plants and gas power plants has to be added as well. The price of electricity is determined at all times by the last producer to be added to the chain, for instance gas-fired power plants. Therefore, some EU countries have been asking for months to redesign the wholesale electricity market so that the price of gas is decoupled from the price of electricity.However, the decoupling of gas and electricity prices, as suggested by President Ursula von der Leyen in recent months, is not included in the proposal. Instead, the European Commission left the current system unchanged, maintaining that the proposed reform will encourage a phase-out of fossil fuels and reduce their impact on electricity prices.Under the new proposal, state subsidies for new investments in wind farms, solar energy, hydropower, geothermal energy and electricity from nuclear energy are implemented through two-way â€œContracts for Difference, long-term buy-sell agreements.â€ Long-term contracts for power generation from renewable energies and nuclear power are to be promoted in particular, according to the proposal presented by the European Commission in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The Commission also wants to encourage private and public investment in renewables and nuclear power.EU member states have yet to agreeVon der Leyen is counting on the EU member states and the European Parliament to conclude negotiations on the new proposal by the time of the European elections in May 2024. This, she said, has been well thought out and intensive consultations have been held with experts. ""That's why I think it's worth working hard to get it ready before the European elections.""According to a press release from the Slovenian Ministry of the Environment, Climate and Energy, the proposal does not yet adequately address some other aspects of high energy prices that member states discussed as part of emergency measures last year. These challenges are the liquidity of electricity suppliers and measures to prevent speculative trading. Another challenge is recognizing the role of investments that facilitate a transition from coal to gas.Unlike France and Spain, for example, the German government is likely to welcome the fact that the EU Commission is foregoing quite far-reaching changes for the time being. Germany, together with countries such as the Netherlands, Denmark and Luxembourg, had recently repeatedly warned against a hasty reform.When asked if the Commission supports the use of nuclear energy to achieve the set climate goals, von der Leyen said that â€œthe type of energy mix with which each member state wants to achieve the climate objectives depends on them.â€ France is pushing for the recognition of nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source, with Germany as one of the main opponents. Von der Leyen added that it is important to stick to the jointly established goals of climate neutrality by 2050 and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent by 2030.Reducing dependence on ChinaSpeaking about the EU's relations with China, von der Leyen said on Monday:  ""For the European Union [it] is important to de-risk but not to decouple from China.""Ursula von der Leyen""De-risk means we do not want the dependency we experienced with Russia and fossil fuels. We do not want dependency, for example, on critical raw materials, and therefore we are diversifying and we are strengthening our supply chains with like-minded partners,"" she said. At the same time, according to the President of the Commission, it is important to cooperate in mitigating climate change, to limit global warming and to ensure equal market conditions for all. ""Therefore, we want our companies to have access to the Chinese market, we want transparency in terms of subsidies and a clear commitment to respecting intellectual property,"" she said.EU unveils clean tech plan amid competition from US and ChinaThe European Commission is set to present its Net-Zero Industry Act on Thursday in a bid to help Europe challenge the financial power of the United States and China in the field. The EU's new Net-Zero Industry Act will be published alongside a text on ""critical raw materials"", which aims to secure EU supplies of rare earths critical for green tech.â€œThe package proves that we can cut emissions and have a growth strategy, because we see now globally that there is a strong push for clean technologies and we want to stay the frontrunner in that industry,â€ von der Leyen said. She added that the clean tech industry is crucial for Europe â€œnot only to meet our climate goals, but also to innovate in the industry in a way, that with limiting global warming, we are the ones who are exporting our technology.â€Brussels was pushed into unveiling its own plan after EU states criticized US President Joe Biden's ""buy American"" subsidy program, the Inflation Reduction Act, as discriminatory against their industries. But critics now warn that leaked drafts of the Commission's proposals show the EU could follow suit and look to deter clean tech imports in a bid to help its own companies. However, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denied on Monday that the EU's response to huge US green subsidies was ""protectionist.â€""This is our decision to invest in the net zero industry and to facilitate the development of new clean technologies, so to cut red tape and to reduce the bureaucratic burden, to have timelines in the permitting processes so that we speed up,"" von der Leyen told agencies in the European Newsroom. ""But there is not a single point that is protectionist. On the contrary, it's a very open act.""This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: German Greens demand EU debt rules reform,"Finance politicians from the German Green Party push for rapid reform of the EUâ€™s fiscal rules on government deficits and debts. European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton visits a Bulgarian military-industrial complex in the context of Ukraine's growing ammunition needs. The Slovak Republic increases its military representation to NATO and EU bodies.German Green finance politicians call for swift reform of EU debt rulesBerlin (dpa) – Green Party finance politicians in Germany have called for a swift reform of the EU's strict rules on government deficits and debt, indirectly criticizing Germanyâ€™s liberal Finance Minister Christian Lindner. ""A delay from Germany causes justified irritation among other member states. And it weakens the EU's ability to act at a time when we cannot afford a European inability to act, due to the horrific war of aggression on Ukraine,"" German member of parliament Jamila SchÃ¤fer said on Wednesday.Lindner had pushed through amendments to a joint declaration on the Stability and Growth Pact at the meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels. Among other things, the demand was added that the European Commission should engage in a close exchange with the Member States before it submitted its reform proposals. This is to take place in the coming weeks.Green Party budget expert Sven-Christian Kindler warned against delays: ""It is in the interest of all member states that we reform the EU fiscal rules by the end of the year at the latest,"" he said. The new rules would have to make investments into the climate-neutral transformation of the European economy a condition for extended debt reduction deadlines.The Stability and Growth Pact imposes a debt ceiling of 60 percent of annual economic output and a maximum budget deficit of 3 percent. The rules were suspended because of the Covid-19 crisis, but the exceptions are set to expire by the end of this year. (March 16)Commissioner Thierry Breton gets impression of Bulgarian military-industrial complexSofia/Sopot (BTA) – European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton visited Bulgaria to learn about the capabilities of the local military-industrial complex against the backdrop of Ukraine's growing ammunition needs. He discussed the need to increase production to replenish stocks with Bulgarian interim Defence Minister Dimitar Stoyanov. The European Union is expected to provide funds to upgrade the production base.â€œBulgaria has a long history in the defence industry and is a very important partner for that industry in Europe,â€ Breton said.â€œThe Bulgarian military industry needs targeted assistance to transform and increase production to NATO standards,â€ Bulgarian interim Deputy Minister of Economy and Industry Irina Shchonova stated.This week, the European Commission clarified that in the EU, 15 companies in 11 countries are producing ammunition that Ukraine needs right now. Commissioner Breton is scheduled to meet with representatives of all these companies to find out what is needed to boost production. (March 15)Military representation of Slovak Republic to NATO and EU bodies to expandBratislava (TASR) – In 2023, the military representation of the Slovak Republic to the European Union and NATO bodies will be expanded from 94 to 107 members of the Slovak Armed Forces (SAF). The increase is laid out in a Defence Ministry update on military representation which was approved by the National Council, Slovakia's parliament, on Wednesday.""The update of the military representation is proposed in response to changes in the global security environment, reflecting the needs of the Slovak Republic in the process of implementing transformational changes, valid international commitments to NATO and EU allies and bilateral agreements with partners,"" the submitted material reads.The expansion of the military representation is also related to the implementation of defence and deterrence measures on NATO's eastern flank. The material suggests that, following parliamentary approval, Slovakia could add military representation at the Joint Support and Security Command in Ulm, Germany, at the US Joint Special Operations University in Tampa, as well as at the Special Operations Command Europe in Baumholder, Germany. Slovak soldiers could also serve at the Special Operations Forces Command in Krakow, Poland, as well as at the US Divisional Command in Romania. (March 15)Slovenian PM pledges assistance to help BiH on its European pathSarajevo (STA) – Slovenia wants to be Bosnia and Herzegovina's greatest ally and will therefore provide it with all possible assistance on its path towards the European Union, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob announced in Sarajevo on Monday, after meeting the Chair of the BiH Council of Ministers, Borjana KriÅ¡to. Slovenia will allocate an additional 1 million euros from its state budget for technical assistance to BiH.Golob also said that a strategic discussion was taking place within the EU on how best to link the EU with its neighbors. One possible scenario, which is also supported by Slovenia, is that of a phased enlargement. This, he said, means that the candidate country would already benefit concretely during the process of European integration. KriÅ¡to said that the BiH Council of Ministers had already taken certain steps in the area of reforms and stressed that they should also pay special attention to the internal political dialogue.The impact of the war in Ukraine has, in Golob's view, contributed significantly to a change in atmosphere in Brussels when it comes to the enlargement of the Union to the Western Balkans. ""The change is historic. For 20 years, the enlargement process was in fact stalled by so-called technical-administrative issues. Today, EU enlargement has become a political issue, and this moment must be seized,"" Golob said. (March 13)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"No, Frontex did not say 330,000 people had entered Europe illegally in 2022","The president of France's far-right National Rally, Jordan Bardella, claimed on January 16 that EU border agency Frontex reported in a January 13 press release that 330,000 people had entered the European Union illegally in 2022. In reality, the agency did not detect 330,000 people, but 330,000 irregular entries into the EU that year. As Frontex explained to AFP, ""one person can illegally cross the external border of the European Union several times"" and thus be counted several times. Multiple experts interviewed by AFP mentioned the limitations of this figure. They also cautioned against reading too much into the 64 percent year-on-year increase reported by Frontex. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) estimated that nearly 188,000 people had entered Europe illegally in 2022, or an increase of 24 percent compared to 2021. A figure that is ""much more reliable in terms of actual arrivals,"" according to specialists.In an interview with broadcaster CNews on January 16, Bardella lambasted French and European migration policy, denouncing a French government that according to him ""has given up on controlling its borders"" and ""managing its immigration policy"". ""We've gone way too far with our immigration policy,"" he said. The MEP said he drew his figures from a Frontex press release issued on January 13. ""The Frontex report released a couple of days ago says there was an additional 64 percent in illegal entries into the European Union, so 330,000 people who entered illegally,"" Bardella claimed. Others also denounced this alleged laisser-faire approach to EU borders: ""The Frontex hostess agency has let us know that it rolled out the red carpet for 330,000 stowaways during 2022,"" said a tweet posted on January 13 and shared more than 300 times. Individuals vs crossingsBut what does the actual press release say? The border agency did indeed announce a 64 percent increase in illegal entries from 2021 -- the highest figure since 2016, according to Frontex. ""This was the second year in a row with a steep rise in the number of irregular entries,"" it said. So Frontex did not detect 330,000 people, but 330,000 illegal crossings. The agency only records the number of irregular entries detected on EU territory, and not the number of people who entered illegally. Frontex notes that ""the same person may attempt to cross the border several times in different locations"", which means that a single person can be recorded several times. The agency confirmed this in a statement to AFP on January 13: ""We refer here to the number of registered illegal entries and not to the number of persons, as one person can illegally cross the external border of the European Union several times.""Repeated crossings frequentFor a border crossing to be counted, the agency says that ""the person must actually cross the external border and enter the European Union"".The agency says it records each time a person is detected by the authorities but not apprehended, as well as each time a person is stopped and sent back across the border.This means that several entries can be recorded based on a single person who tried to enter repeatedly. According to Thomas Lacroix, a researcher and migration specialist at France's National Centre for Scientific Research, it is not unusual for a person to cross the border several times in an attempt to enter the EU. ""Accounts of migrants who have tried five, 10, 20 times are extremely frequent,"" he told AFP on January 18, referring in particular to research on the border between Serbia and Croatia.Similarly, a person may cross the EU's borders several times but at different entry points. This is notably the case for migrants entering the EU through Greece from Turkey and then exiting the EU through the Balkans before entering again through Croatia or Hungary.IOM figures more reliable for actual irregular arrivalsStatistics from other sources put into perspective the figures released by Frontex. The IOM, the United Nations agency in charge of migration, tallies the number of illegal arrivals on European territory each year via its Displacement Tracking Matrix platform.In an email to AFP on January 18, the IOM said it had counted ""187,993 migrants and refugees who entered Europe illegally"" in 2022. The figure is drawn from its own field data, information from national authorities and media reports. This represents an increase of 24 percent compared to 2021, which is less than the 64 percent calculated by Frontex.""This figure is much more reliable in terms of actual arrivals,"" says Lacroix. Unlike Frontex, the IOM -- whose figures are more stable over time -- says it tries to avoid duplication by, for example, not counting people travelling in the Balkans as it assumes that most are already included in the arrival figures for either Greece, Bulgaria or Cyprus.However, ""as the same person may cross multiple land borders of EU and non-EU countries while moving in the region, there is no way to avoid double counting,"" it told AFP.The IOM added on January 19 that the rise in irregular entry figures may be attributed in part to the relaxation of border restrictions imposed during the Covid-19 pandemic. It noted that ""the overall arrival numbers are in the same range as 2017-2019, and well below the arrivals of 2015-2016,"" the height of the migration crisis. Many of these irregular entries may also be refugees who can legally apply for asylum in the European Union, the IOM said.Frontex figures and their limitationsThis is not the first time that Frontex's figures have caused confusion. In October 2022, French newspaper Liberation fact-checked an article by French radio station Europe 1, which claimed that 228,000 people had crossed the European border illegally over the first nine months of that year. Again, this figure pertained to crossings, not individuals.At the time, Desinfox Migrations, an association that aims to dispel false and misleading information around migration, took to Twitter to warn of this misinterpretation of Frontex figures and called for the figures to be ""put into perspective"".Other observers also contest the Frontex figures.""The Frontex figures must be taken with a grain of salt,"" Tania Racho, a research associate at Paris-Saclay University in European law and consultant for the Desinfox Migrations initiative, told AFP on January 17. Frontex's figures can be ""misleading"" and ""do not really allow us to know how many people have crossed the borders,"" she said.""Frontex is both umpire and player. This is not independent data,"" Virginie Guiraudon, research director at the CNRS at Sciences Po Paris, told AFP on January 17. ""Frontex is not Eurostat,"" she said, referring to the European Union's statistics agency.""To say that the figures have risen sharply is a hasty interpretation that needs to be checked,"" said Lacroix. ""Frontex publishes these figures to justify their own budget increase. It helps them to both justify past budget increases and ask for future ones.""The agency's budget, which has been increasing almost continuously since its launch in 2005, reached 754 million euros in 2022, more than double the amount in 2020 (364 million euros). In its press release, Frontex recalled its role in protecting Europe's borders. ""These events, along with the steadily increasing number of irregular crossings, demonstrate the need for strong and effective European Border and Coast Guard, with Frontex as strong supporter of Member States,"" it said. Increase in detection capabilitiesLacroix and Racho said the rise in numbers would also be explained in part by the significant increase in Frontex's human and budgetary resources, for example the more extensive use of drones and surveillance cameras to detect irregular crossings.Guiraudon added, however, that Frontex data includes information provided by government authorities. ""The agency's budget increase is very significant, but the Frontex border guards are just 1,500 people,"" she said. The increase in border-monitoring resources may explain an increase in detections in the medium term, but not from one year to the next, she said.""This does not mean that the figures are meaningless and show no trends,"" Guiraudon said, while urging -- like the rest of the researchers interviewed -- utmost caution with regard to Frontex data.Frontex HQ in Warsaw, Poland (Photo AFP / Wojtek RADWANSKI)Nathan GALLOTous ses articlesAFP FranceTous ses articles",1
Europe in brief: Norway seeks closer energy cooperation with Germany,"Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr StÃ¸re expects the energy cooperation with Germany to be stepped-up even further, as the countries are in talks about wind energy, hydrogen and more. French President Emmanuel Macron backs Moldova in the face of ""Russian attempts to destabilize"" the country. Spain adopts a pension reform along the lines of demands from the European Commission.Norway expects even closer cooperation with GermanyBergen (dpa) – Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr StÃ¸re expects even closer cooperation with Germany on energy issues and beyond. ""Since last year, we have seen a rather spectacular acceleration in Norwegian-German energy cooperation,"" StÃ¸re said during a visit to the Troll A gas production platform, which is located off the west coast of Norway. Among other things, he said, the two countries were now talking about wind energy, CO2 storage and hydrogen. StÃ¸re added that he expected the cooperation with Germany to increase further.Germany is Norway's most important European partner, as evidenced by the country's recent decision to purchase new Leopard 2 tanks from Germany. The core of the cooperation is that the two countries are political partners. For Norway, it is important that Germany has a government that is interested in and knowledgeable about matters in the north.StÃ¸re had visited the Norwegian gas production platform Troll A in the North Sea on 17 March, together with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg. The Troll gas field west of Bergen covered more than eleven percent of gas consumption within the EU last year. Norway's gas supplies were important for Europe's security, StÃ¸re stressed. ""It's important for Europe to have a democratic partner in an energy world with not so democratic partners,"" he said.Germany has become Norway's most important export country in 2022. That's largely due to natural gas: last year, Germany imported about 726 billion Norwegian kroner (about 64 billion euros) worth of goods from the Scandinavian country, with gas supplies alone accounting for 621 billion kroner. (March 18)Macron expresses support for Moldova in the face of ""Russian destabilization attemptsâ€Paris (AFP) – On Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron expressed his support to his Moldovan counterpart Maia Sandu in the face of ""Russian attempts at destabilization"" in the former Soviet republic and the ""tensions they cause,"" the ElysÃ©e Palace announced.During a telephone conversation, Macron also welcomed the reform efforts in Moldova, including that of ""justice to improve the fight against corruption,"" the French Presidency added. Moldova is a candidate for becoming a member of the European Union.Moldova, a neighbor of Ukraine, says it faces ""a hybrid war"" led by Moscow to overthrow the pro-European executive in power in Chisinau.""Recalling the importance of continuing to reform the country,"" Emmanuel Macron offered to make ""experts, especially in cyber and economic matters"" available to Chisinau.He also said he was ready to ""provide all necessary assistance"" to Moldova for the organization of the European Political Community summit scheduled in the country for 1 June. (March 17)Spain approves pension reform called for by the European CommissionMadrid (EFE) – The Spanish government approved a pension reform along the lines demanded by the European Commission, which is backed by the main trade unions, but rejected by employers. The reform, approved in an extraordinary meeting of the left-wing coalition government, had been demanded by Brussels, as it enables the bloc to continue with the disbursement of European recovery funds to Spain.The reform â€œculminates the modernization of our pension system and shields the purchasing power of all present and future pensioners,â€ Spanish Minister of Social Security JosÃ© Luis EscrivÃ¡ said.The reform includes measures to increase the income of the pension system, after the Commission had warned about its sustainability and reproached the Spanish government for not complying with the prevision to present the reform before the end of 2022. To boost the income of the system, the reform provides for a progressive increase of the current maximum contribution base of 4,495.50 euros per month, so that between 2024 and 2050 it will rise each year by the same amount as the consumer price index plus 1.2 percentage points.Another measure is an intergenerational equity mechanism with an increase in social contributions from this year, to progressively increase from 0.6 percent to 1.2 percent. The minister assured that, in this way, the reserve fund to guarantee pensions would increase to around 120,000 million euros at the beginning of the 2040s. This would ensure the viability of the system in a country in which the number of pensioners is set to rise when the so-called ""baby boomer"" generation retires. Some fourteen million children were born in Spain between 1958 and 1977. The retirement age in the country is 65, but it is expected to rise to 67 in 2027, although this may vary depending on the number of years of contribution. (March 16)Europe limits dependence on third countries for strategic raw materialsBrussels (Belga) – The European Union must become more self-sufficient with regard to the extraction, processing and recycling of critical raw materials, which are considered indispensable in sectors such as the green and digital industries, aerospace and defense. For each strategic raw material – whose supply may be compromised in the future – Europe should not be dependent on a third country, such as China, for more than 65 percent, a new proposal from the European Commission stated on Thursday.At issue is the Critical Raw Materials Act. It is a crucial part of the Commission's green industrial plan and aims to reduce European dependence on third countries. In the European Parliament on Wednesday, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen summed up that 98 percent of the rare earths currently used in the European industry come from China, as do 93 percent of magnesium and 97 percent of lithium.The Commission has created separate lists for critical and strategic raw materials. The latter are used in strategic sectors of the European industry and are in danger of becoming scarce due to the growing demand predicted for the coming years. That is why the Commission wants Europe to extract itself at least 10 percent of the strategic raw materials it consumes per annum. Europe should also be able to process 40 percent itself and recycle 15 percent.The Commission sets a goal of reducing dependence on a third country to 65 percent at each stage of processing of a specific strategic raw material.The Critical Raw Materials Act is now passed on to Parliament and the Member States for negotiations. The Commission also proposed the Net-Zero Industry Act on Thursday. (March 16)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

Another banking crisis? ECB confident about eurozone financial resilience,"The recent collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) in the United States and the crisis at Credit Suisse in Switzerland over the weekend set off concerns regarding contagion across the international financial sector. While European governments and financial institutions closely monitor the situation, it is not all bleak. On Monday, European political and financial leaders moved to shore up consumer confidence following the crisis at Credit Suisse, Switzerland's second largest bank. The emergency takeover of Credit Suisse by its competitor UBS and the difficulties of some smaller US institutions have fueled concerns about banks in the eurozone in the course of this week.European advisors confirmed that in the event of a bank failure in the European Union, a fixed rule applies under which shareholders and other creditors are called upon. Bank losses would first be borne by share capital. If this is insufficient, subordinated bonds, so-called AT1 capital, are called in.In the case of Credit Suisse, the holders of these equity-like bonds are to lose their invested money completely in the course of the takeover by UBS. For these AT1 bonds, the loss amounts to 16 billion Swiss francs (16 billion euros). Credit Suisse shareholders will also forfeit a large part of their invested money, but will receive UBS securities.European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde remained optimistic that there would be no spillover of the event on the eurozone financial system. The European banking sector was resilient thanks to strong capital and liquidity positions, Lagarde said. In the face of the current market tensions, the ECB was ready to support the financial system with liquidity if necessary, and to maintain the smooth functioning of monetary policy, she added.Last week, the ECB had raised the key interest rate by 50 basis points despite the turmoil. In view of the current high level of uncertainty, the central bank did not commit itself for the future. Lagarde made it clear that the monetary guardians will be guided by economic data.Within Europe, politicians and central bankers are at odds over the effectiveness of the ECBâ€™s latest interest rate decisions.Italy: ECB interest rate policy under scrutinyItalian Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said on Monday that he believed the impact of the crisis at Switzerland's Credit Suisse on Italy's banking system would be ""insignificant"". Referring to the market turbulences linked to Credit Suisse and, before that, to the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank in the United States, he said he believed that the markets had calmed down a bit. ""I think that the situation in Europe is under control. We are in constant contact with the regulatory authorities and we are tranquil about the Italian banking system.""The Milan stock exchange plummeted 2.6 percent in early trading on Monday, with bank stocks taking a fresh pounding after over a week of turbulences on the international money markets. The rescue of Credit Suisse announced over the weekend had failed to dispel investor concerns. On Tuesday, the Milan exchange closed 2.53 percent up, as bank stocks rallied strongly from recent losses on Silicon Valley Bank and Credit Suisse.Giorgetti also reiterated his criticism of the European Central Bank's policy of hiking interest rates to combat high levels of inflation. ""[The policy] should be calibrated with great care because increasing interest rates might be useful to control inflation, but it can also cause problems for financial stability,"" he said.The ECBâ€™s decision to increase the key interest rate by 50 basis points leaves the Italian government unsatisfied. ""The ECB is not moving in the right direction, even if today there was a start of rethinking. In our opinion, it is not a good way to deal with inflation,â€ said Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani.France: Basel III rules saved the dayEuropean banks were in ""extremely solid"" shape and their situation was not similar to that of some US lenders, FranÃ§ois Villeroy de Galhau, governor of the Banque de France and a member of the ECBâ€™s governing council, said last week amid fears of a crisis in the sector.""European banks are not in the same situation as certain American banks for a very simple reason, which is that they are not subjected to the same rules,"" he added. Rules known as Basel III that were created after the 2008 financial crisis to ensure that banks had adequate capital and liquidity had been ""effective"", Villeroy de Galhau said. He added that 400 European banking groups were subject to the Basel III requirements, compared to only 13 in the United States.Under Donald Trump's presidency, small- and mid-sized US banks had been exempted from the Basel rules in 2019, he said, noting that both Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, which collapsed last week, were among those. The French central bank governor explained that Credit Suisse was a special case. ""It's a bank that has both business model difficultiesâ€ as well as â€œfailures in its internal control system,"" he said.While the ECB said it stood ready to provide liquidity to ensure the stability of the eurozone's financial system, it stuck to a hefty interest-rate hike of half a percentage point to mitigate inflation, despite fears that rising borrowing costs may add further stress on banks. Villeroy de Galhau said the ECB's move sent a ""strong"" sign of confidence in its anti-inflation strategy and the solidity of European and French banks.Slovenia, Bulgaria and Germany maintain a calm attitudeOn Monday, the Bank of Slovenia said that the European and Slovenian banking systems were operating strongly, notwithstanding the turmoil in the US and Swiss banking systems. ""The euro area banking sector is resilient, with strong capital and liquidity positions,"" the Slovenian Central Bank added.According to the reassurances by the Bank of Slovenia, the range of the European Central Bank's monetary policy instruments is sufficiently broad to provide liquidity support to the financial system when needed.Bulgarian Interim Finance Minister Rozita Velkova commented that at this point there was no risk of a contagion for Bulgaria from the bank failures in the US.Senior financial analyst at MoitePari.bg Desislava Nikolova noted that the ECB's interest rate hikes, which started in 2022, had not affected the banking market in Bulgaria because of its strong liquidity. The country had sufficient resources to slow down the processes related to interest rate hikes, she said. Not being part of the eurozone, Bulgaria has kept the lowest lending and deposit interest rates, Nikolova said. She expects that instead of a more gradual rise in interest rates, Bulgaria may now see a faster increase because in macroeconomic terms, the latest developments caused uncertainty.On Monday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz welcomed the ""decisive action of the Swiss authorities"" in the takeover of the ailing Credit Suisse by its competitor UBS, a government spokesman said. European authorities had learned from the 2008 financial crisis and tightened banking regulations, he stressed. ""The German banking system is therefore well positioned,"" the spokesman added.End of ECB interest rate hikes not yet in sightAccording to the President of the German Bundesbank Joachim Nagel, who sits on the ECB's Monetary Policy Council, the ECB has not yet reached the end of its interest rate hike course. At the same time, he said in an interview with the Financial Times, interest rates were approaching the restrictive range. Economists consider this to be the level at which interest rates start to slow down economic activity.Nagel stressed that the ECB would have to resist calls for early interest rate cuts once the interest rate peak had been reached. Otherwise, he said, high inflation threatens to flare up again. ""Our fight against inflation is not over,"" said the chief of Germanyâ€™s central bank.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: German Ministry of Transport seeks quick settlement of combustion dispute,"In the dispute over the planned ban on new cars with internal combustion engines, the EU Commission has proposed a solution to the German government. Other news this week: EU member states criticize a proposed ban of bottom trawling in the fishing industry and Bulgariaâ€™s interim government does not plan for additional military aid to Ukraine.Berlin/Brussels (dpa) – German Transport Minister Volker Wissing is seeking a quick agreement in the dispute with the EU Commission over the planned ban on new cars with internal combustion engines. A spokeswoman said in Berlin on Wednesday that talks were at an advanced stage. â€œWe have comprehensively clarified many legal issues and can now move on to the next details. Our goal remains: to reach an agreement as quickly as possible. The procedures are extremely complicated and require careful consideration by both sides.â€An EU summit started in Brussels on Thursday. Wissing and his liberal FDP want the EU Commission to identify a reliable way in which passenger cars with internal combustion engines could still be newly registered even after 2035, provided they were powered only by so-called e-fuels.A spokesman for Environment Minister Steffi Lemke (Greens), referring to a proposed solution by the EU Commission, said that this draft appeared to take into account the concerns of the FDP and that nothing stood in the way of an agreement. In the draft, which is available to German press agency dpa, the Commission defines criteria for the approval of new vehicles that can run exclusively on CO2-neutral fuels.In fact, negotiators from the European Parliament and the EU states had already agreed in autumn that only emission-free new cars might be registered in the EU from 2035. However, a vote by the EU Member States to confirm the deal, scheduled for early March, was canceled due to additional demands from Germany. As Italy, Bulgaria and Poland also reject the ban on internal combustion vehicles, the law would not have achieved the necessary majority without German approval.Within the German federal government, the FDP in particular insists that even after 2035, new cars with combustion engines may still be registered if they use climate-neutral e-fuels. The party justifies this with a so-called recital clause in the autumn agreement, which provides for certain exemptions for combustion engines using e-fuels. (March 22)EU-27 criticize plan to eliminate trawling in protected areas by 2030Brussels (Europa Press) â€” On Monday, the Ministers of Agriculture and Fisheries of the European Union voiced their broad rejection of the European Commissionâ€™s idea to eliminate trawling in marine protected areas by 2030. They consider it â€œhasty and unbalancedâ€, thinking that it is not taking into account socio-economic consequences.The ban is part of the plan presented by the European Commission last February to reduce the impact of bottom fishing and protect and restore marine ecosystems.But countries such as Belgium, Germany, Greece, Ireland and the Netherlands pointed out that a ban on trawling â€œis not the best wayâ€ to achieve the climate objectives pursued by the EU. Spain and France, for their part, are concerned that this practice will end up disappearing if it is reduced to the levels of the Commissionâ€™s plan of action. In Spain, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas, expressed the need to act cautiously when it comes to regulating trawling. In Spanish territory, 805 vessels operate in the sector – just under 10 percent of the entire Spanish fleet – and their activity is already subject to restrictions in certain pelagic or semi-pelagic areas. (20 March)No additional direct military aid for Ukraine from BulgariaBRUSSELS/SOFIA – The Bulgarian interim government is not preparing an agreement to provide additional military and military-technical assistance to Ukraine, interim Defence Minister Dimitar Stoyanov said.He participated in the meeting of his EU counterparts, where a project for the joint acquisition and delivery of 155-mm projectiles to Ukraine was discussed. Stoyanov clarified that Bulgaria is not part of this general procurement, as the Bulgarian Army does not have any means to use this caliber.Stoyanov explained that the Bulgarian state and private companies produce ammunition of the specified caliber. A week ago, EU Commissioner Thierry Breton had visited Bulgaria to get acquainted with the possibilities for providing Ukraine with the ammunition needed. Bulgarian companies are expected to continue the execution of contracts for the supply of ammunition to EU countries.Meanwhile, the interim government adopted a decision to extend the humanitarian assistance program for Ukrainian refugees in Bulgaria.

"Claims about Italy deciding not to comply with an EU ‘ban on combustion cars’ in 2035 are misleading
","The EU ban on sales of new fossil fuel cars from 2035 is expected to be formally adopted this year. Posts shared thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter since December claim that Italy ""has decided not to comply"" with the ban. Yet, AFP found no trace of an official statement of the sort in the Italian press. What's more, an EU government cannot legally refuse to implement the regulation, which is an EU law that is directly applicable to the citizens of member states. Finally, the primacy of EU law over national law is enshrined in a declaration annexed to the TFEU -- the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union -- which was ratified by all EU members, European legal experts told AFP. In a bid to tackle the climate crisis, the European Commission plans to adopt an agreement that sets the path towards zero CO2 emissions for new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles within the European Union in 2035. This will end sales of new hybrid, petrol and diesel-driven cars in favour of 100 percent electric ones. It is in this context that viral posts shared on Facebook and Twitter claim that the Italian government made a formal commitment to not comply with the regulation, which has yet to be nodded into law. ""Italy has decided NOT to comply with the European lunacy of banning combustion vehicles in 2035. The floodgates are open, others will follow,"" reads the false claim shared more than 10,000 times (1, 2, 3...) on Facebook and nearly 5,000 times (4, 5...) on Twitter since December 2022.Screenshot taken on Facebook on January 4, 2023Screenshot taken on Facebook on January 6, 2023To support the claim, many of the authors of the posts mention either an article from the auto news site Turbo or one from the trade magazine L'Auto-journal.Both posted online on December 9, 2022, they refer to remarks made by Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini -- who is also the transport minister -- and quoted by Bloomberg. ""The risk is that of a pseudo-environmental fundamentalism that doesn't help the environment, but leaves tens of thousands of workers without a job... Outlawing petrol and diesel cars by 2035 while calling for a switch to Euro7 standards by 2025 makes no economic, environmental or social sense,"" Salvini said. There was however no mention of a formal decision by Italy to refuse to comply with the EU regulation.AFP also did not find any official statement of the kind in the Italian press. In any case, the Italian government is, like every member of the European Union, required to comply with European law as defined by its treaties. In the event of non-compliance with a regulation, it could face significant financial penalties imposed by the Court of Justice of the European Union. Italian judges could also directly penalise auto dealers were they to sell CO2-emitting vehicles beyond 2035, given that EU law takes precedence over the laws of member states, European legal experts told AFP. EU regulation not yet in forceThe posts shared on social media include several inaccuracies.""Italy has decided NOT to comply with the European lunacy of banning combustion vehicles in 2035,"" they claim. Yet, not only has the Italian government not made such a decision, but the regulation in question has not even yet officially entered into force.Indeed, the process of negotiating, validating and formally adopting an EU regulation takes several months or even years. ""It works more or less like your traditional legislative process,"" Vincent Couronne, director of Les Surligneurs -- an association of lawyers specialising in the fight against legal disinformation -- and European legal expert, told AFP on January 4.""The legislative proposal is made by the European Commission. Then the European Parliament (which is the lower house, similar to France's National Assembly) and the Council (the upper house, like the senate), each debate the text, amend and adopt it,"" Couronne said.""In the Parliament, it's adopted the conventional way, by a majority of votes. At the Council, it's a bit more complex in that it's a system of qualified majority voting,"" he added. In that system, at least 55 percent of member states must vote in favour (which corresponds to 15 of the 27 EU members) and the member states that support the proposal must represent at least 65 percent of the population of the European Union, according to Toute l'Europe, a reference site for European information. The main decision-making bodies of the European UnionIn the case of the agreement regarding zero emissions from new cars and vans by 2035, the legislative proposal was made by the European Commission in July 2021, the member states adopted their position on June 29, 2022 during a meeting of EU environment ministers in Luxembourg, and a provisional agreement was reached by the Parliament and Council on October 27, 2022. ""EU negotiators secured an agreement with member states on the Commission's original proposal to reach zero-emission road mobility by 2035 (an EU fleet-wide target to reduce the CO2 emissions produced by new passenger cars and light commercial vehicles by 100% compared to 2021),"" the European Parliament said in a press release.The European Parliament then voted to adopt the text on February 14. However it still needs to be formally endorsed by Council, before it can be published in the EU Official Journal and enter into force.""The final text still needs to be approved, but it's a formality. Political agreement has already been achieved on the matter,"" Thomas Pellerin-Carlin, director of the EU Programme at the Institute for Climate Economics, told AFP on January 6.Despite what the social media posts claim, the agreement does not ban combustion cars altogether, but instead puts an end to sales of new ones. Leading car producer Germany has also demanded that Brussels provide assurances the law would allow the sale of new cars with combustion engines that run on synthetic fuels, and on March 25 the two sides struck a deal on the future use of efuels in cars.The EU regulation fits into the wider picture of a package adopted by the European Commission in 2021 called ""Fit for 55"", whose legislative proposals aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, and achieve climate neutrality in 2050.""It's one of the key elements of the Green Deal, the number one priority of the European Commission, which in 2021 adopted the European climate law. This law has several objectives, with a particular focus on climate neutrality by 2050,"" Pellerin-Carlin said. Italian government is legally subject to European lawSince its inauguration, the Italian sovereigntist government has on many occasions expressed its reservations about the plan to ban new sales of fossil fuel cars from 2035.For example, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the following at her end-of-year press conference on December 29: ""No, I don't consider it reasonable. I consider it deeply damaging to our manufacturing sector. It seems to me there is cross-party agreement in Italy on the issue and I intend to make use of that consensus to forcefully raise the issue.""Italian PM Giorgia Meloni and Deputy PM and Transport minister  Matteo Salvini, during a press conference in Rome, on November 22, 2022. (AFP / Filippo MONTEFORTE)The Italian government however will not be able to legally refuse to implement the accord once it comes into effect.""Legally, a priori, Italy cannot opt out of applying the agreement. It's a regulation: a European legislative act that member states are required to respect and apply,"" Couronne said. ""What's distinctive about an EU regulation is that it is directly applicable in all member states of the European Union. So it is first up to Italian citizens and companies to respect it. What this means is that starting January 2035, auto dealers will no longer be allowed to sell cars that emit CO2,"" he added. ""Unlike a directive, which applies to member states, a regulation is a European law that directly constrains the key actors, so in this case the carmakers,"" said Pellerin-Carlin.""Were an auto dealer to decide to continue to sell this kind of engine, it would be up to Italy to punish him for breaking EU law. But were it to not do so, were Italy to fail to ensure that its dealers were no longer selling CO2-emitting cars, then it would be Italy that would be responsible vis-a-vis the European Union and which could be subject to financial penalties from the Court of Justice of the European Union for non-compliance with EU regulation,"" Couronne said.What's more, it is not within the government's purview to circumvent an EU regulation. Indeed, ""Italy would have to amend the law to prohibit judges and Italians from respecting the regulation. Only the parliament could do it,"" Couronne said. ""In any case, even if the parliament were to adopt this kind of law, the Italian constitutional council would automatically condemn it for notably undermining the independence of the judiciary.""Primacy of European law over national lawIn concrete terms, the application of this EU regulation will be supervised by national judges (Italian, Spanish, French), who are directly subject to European law. Indeed, ""there's a principle of the primacy of EU law,"" said Couronne. ""It is enshrined in a declaration annexed to the TFEU in which member states recognise the principle of primacy and its validity.""This statement is available online on the EUR-Lex website, which provides official access to EU legal documents.Screenshot taken on the EUR-Lex website on March 27, 2023""If an Italian NGO of the likes of... Greenpeace so wishes, it could file a complaint in 2035 with the European court in Luxembourg -- harnessing EU law -- or directly with an Italian judge,"" said Pellerin-Carlin.""If there's a conflict between Italian law and European law, it's European law that wins. It's what we call the principle of primacy, which says that all EU legislation prevails over national law,"" he added. No EU government will thus be legally able to waive the application of the regulation on CO2 standards for cars. An amendment known as the ""Ferrari amendment"", which was notably supported by Italian MEPs, was nevertheless added to the draft legislative text. It states that the greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements for all manufacturers in the EU market should be aligned ""except for those responsible for less than 1,000 new vehicles registered in a calendar year."" This amendment will benefit Italian luxury brands in particular. The EU has also provided for a ""review clause"", to make a first assessment in 2026, but it ""should really be understood as a form of political sympathy. Seeing as certain member states are against this agreement, in the spirit of compromise the European Union will take stock of the situation in 2026, but this has no legislative constraint,"" said Pellerin-Carlin.In the closing stretch of negotiations at the European Council level in June 2022, Mario Draghi's Italy, backed by four other countries, proposed that the EU ban on new sales of combustion engine vehicles be pushed back to 2040, instead of 2035, as mentioned in the Commission's initial proposal. This request was not entertained because the member states had collectively decided on 2035, the definitive date. Emilie BERAUDTous ses articlesAFP FranceTous ses articlesCLIMATE Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Nehammer to discuss financing of e-fuel research with car manufacturers,"Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer plans to organize a summit with car manufacturers to talk about e-fuels. Several member states call for urgent reforms of the Common European Asylum System. French President Emmanuel Macron and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen are expected to travel to China together.Austrian chancellor plans e-fuel summitVienna (APA) – Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer is planning a car summit. In the coming weeks, he wants to discuss the possibilities of financing research on e-fuels with manufacturers, he announced on Austrian television on Sunday. Nehammer was reserved about the European Central Bankâ€™s (ECB) demand for the Austrian Raiffeisen International Bank (RBI) to withdraw from Russia.Nehammer pointed out that RBI was not the only European financial institution still active in Russia. At the same time, he emphasized that the bank was also active in Ukraine and was a systemically important bank there. According to Nehammer, Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj had not addressed the issue of RBI during a recent conversation.Nehammer said that RBI, like all banks, had to comply with international laws and regulations in principle. Now one had to wait and see which decisions would be made.Shortly after an EU Summit in Brussels last week, the European Commission and the German government had reached an agreement allowing for combustion engines to run on CO2-neutral fuels after 2035. Nehammer was positive about the compromise on combustion engine cars. He said he trusted science with regard to e-fuels. The goal would have to be to export this technology to the markets of the future, he said, referring to the boom in climate-damaging coal-fired power plants in China.The chancellor also rejects nuclear power, which is being pushed by France, ""We are clearly against it."" However, he also pointed out that the world was in a transitional period. Nuclear power was also used in Austria, he said. While Austria has no nuclear power plants on its territory, it imports electricity generated by them. (March 26)Consultations on EU asylum reform: internal border controls a last resortBerlin (dpa) – If there is no agreement on better registration and distribution of asylum seekers in Europe by the summer, interior ministers consider freedom of movement in the Schengen area in danger. The window of opportunity for a comprehensive reform of the Common European Asylum System (CEAS) would close in the summer, said German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser in Berlin on Friday, after a meeting with interior ministers and state secretaries from five other EU states. The EU Member States would have to reach an agreement by then, so there would still be time for negotiations with the European Parliament.Should an agreement not be reached, ""then the Schengen area with open internal borders is in great danger,"" Faeser warned. Everyone in the European Parliament and the Council had to be aware of this, she added.Sweden also sees this risk, ""but nobody wants it to come to that,"" said Anders Hall, Swedish State Secretary at the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs. Sweden currently holds the EU Council Presidency and will hand over the baton to Spain on 1 July.Internal border controls would have to remain the exception, stressed Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska. For Spain, freedom of movement in the Schengen area is an important pillar of the European Union.In concrete terms, the aim is to ensure that those seeking protection are reliably registered in the EU states where they first arrive. Ideally, that state should also check in the future whether someone has any prospect of being recognized as a refugee. However, countries with external EU borders, such as Italy or Malta, are not prepared to do this yet. They insist that the distribution of asylum seekers within Europe must be better regulated at first.So far, only a few states – above all Germany – have voluntarily taken on a few asylum seekers. Faeser said that Germany had taken over 427 people from Italy and 93 asylum seekers from Cyprus via the solidarity mechanism, and that further takeovers were planned. Italy has been blocking the transfer of asylum seekers registered in Italy for several weeks, citing alleged technical problems. (March 24)Macron in China from 5 to 8 April to discuss Ukraine and Franco-Chinese cooperationParis (AFP) – French President Emmanuel Macron will make a ""state visit"" to China from 5 to 8 April, accompanied by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, in order to work â€œtowards a return to peace"" in Ukraine with Chinese President Xi Jinping.Macronâ€™s trip had been announced in late February, but the Ã‰lysÃ©e only revealed the precise dates, stages and objectives last Friday. The French president will go to Beijing, but also to Canton.As Emmanuel Macron announced at a press conference in Brussels on Friday, the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen would be present ""on part of the program"" in the name of ""European unity"", which was  ""an essential prerequisite for building a balanced partnership with China.â€The Head of State recalled that he had ""endeavored to coordinate and carry a European voice"" with regard to Russia and the war in Ukraine. (24 March 2023)Slovenia keen to participate in ammunition production, prime minister saysBrussels, 23 March (STA) - Slovenia should take part in the production of ammunition, which should be equally divided across the EU, said Prime Minister Robert Golob as he arrived to the EU leaders summit in Brussels, where joint procurement of artillery ammunition for Ukraine will be discussed.Golob sees it as beneficial that the EU is moving towards not only joint purchases but also joint production of ammunition.""Defence budgets will grow and it is right that the money is spent locally, in the member states and with the goal of economic development,"" the prime minister said. Slovenia should join the production, not only the purchasing of ammunition, Golob added.As Defence Minister Marjan Å arec recently pointed out, Slovenia currently does not have capabilities to produce artillery shells.The procurement of ammunition will be the main focus of the upcoming visit of the European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton to Slovenia.""We will run through different scenarios, what is possible in the European framework and what the European Commission is able to support,"" said Golob, adding that more details will be known after the visit.On Monday, 17 EU members and Norway joined the Common Procurement of Ammunition, a project by the European Defence Agency that will send one million ammunition rounds to Ukraine in the next 12 months. Slovenia will join the project shortly.This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

Von der Leyen calls for new response to China,"Ahead of her trip to Beijing next week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for a realignment in relations with China on Thursday. But is this at all possible given the strong economic ties?â€œChinaâ€™s reach stretches across all continents and global institutions – and its ambitions are far greater still,â€ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in Brussels on Thursday, ahead of her trip to Beijing with French President Emmanuel Macron next week.â€œDefining a European strategy towards China (â€¦) must start with a sober assessment of our current relations and of Chinaâ€™s strategic intentions,â€ she added, at the same time stressing that not engaging with Beijing was ""neither viable – nor in Europe's interest.""Von der Leyen focused on economic risks for the EU, and how Europe should respond to them. She said that 9 percent of EU exports were going to China, while more than 20 percent of imports came from that Asian country. While this imbalance was growing, most trade did not pose risks, she said. But there were risks to economic or national security in some areas, von der Leyen added. Here, the relationship had to be rebalanced. According to von der Leyen, it was necessary to ensure that economic relations promoted the prosperity of both sides.However, she also called out Chinese policies of intimidation and coercion, â€œJust as China has been ramping up its military posture, it has also ramped up its policies of disinformation and economic and trade coercion. This is a deliberate policy targeting other countries to ensure they comply and conform,â€ von der Leyen said.In 2021, China had reacted angrily to Lithuaniaâ€™s attempts to develop closer ties with Taiwan and excluded the Baltic EU member state from its customs system.On Tuesday, the European Parliament and the 27 EU Member States agreed on a new defensive tool to shield against economic intimidation. Among the responses available within the scope of the anti-intimidation instrument are exclusion from the European Union's single market and public tenders, as well as punitive tariffs on non-EU countries trying to interfere in EU political decision making.Spain's prime minister offers his country as â€œreliable partnerâ€ While the Commission president wants to â€œde-risk but not decouple from China,â€ Spainâ€™s Prime Minister, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, went to China a week ahead of her and offered Spain as a ""reliable partnerâ€ for investment as well as multilateral collaboration in conflict resolution and the search for peace.The main aspect of SÃ¡nchez's speech at the opening ceremony of the Boao Economic Forum, which is considered the Asian Davos, was the political and economic trust in Spain. SÃ¡nchez stressed the importance of economic cooperation and advocated free, balanced and fair trade as well as rejecting protectionist tendencies. He said that recent investments by large Chinese construction groups in Spanish engineering companies had created opportunities for the development of joint projects in Latin America. SÃ¡nchez also encouraged further deepening of this cooperation, ""respecting the sovereignty of each country and respecting the rules.""Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez and Chinese Premier Li Qiang greet each other on Thursday in Boao, China, during the Boao Economic Forum, March 30, 2023. Photo: EFE/ Moncloa / Borja Puig de la Bellacasa This meant creating a stable legal framework that allowed domestic and foreign companies to compete on a level playing field, he said, adding that the relations between Europe and China did not need to be confrontational, as there was plenty of room for cooperation that benefited both sides.SÃ¡nchez pointed out that bilateral trade between Spain and China had doubled between 2017 and 2022 to 57.7 billion euros, adding that China was Spain's first supplier and the largest market in Asia for Spanish companies. The number of Chinese citizens and companies visiting or working in Spain is increasing significantly.Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road InitiativeIn 2013, state and party leader Xi Jinping launched the Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, involving billions of euros of investments and intending to create trade corridors over land and over sea. This includes shares in a number of important ports along the shipping routes for trade to and from China.The Chinese state-owned group Cosco, German logistics company HHLA and the port of Hamburg have now been waiting for the final approval to invest into a container terminal in the German city for 18 months.In 2019, Italy became the first and only G7 country to endorse the controversial Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Chinese investors focused mainly on strategic ports in Trieste, Venice and Ravenna. The memorandum of understanding, signed during a state visit by Xi to Rome, sparked concern in Washington and Brussels, which see the initiative as a way for Beijing to gain influence over strategic assets around the world. By the end of 2023, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni would decide whether or not to renew the agreement. However, in a September 2022 interview with Taiwan's Cna news agency, Meloni called Italy's embrace of China a ""big mistake,"" adding that she ""hardly sees the political conditions"" for renewing the agreement.Chinese investors showed strong aspirations to take ownership of the Slovenian Port of Koper a few years ago, but some politicians and the public opinion were not in favour, so the port became part of the Belt and Road initiative. Chinese builders also bid in some large infrastructure projects including the project for the construction of a new railway track between Koper and DivaÄa, with an estimated volume of more than 1 billion euros, but were unsuccessful. The failed revival of Maribor Airport in north-eastern Slovenia, involving Chinese-owned SHS Aviation, also left the Slovenian public with a bad taste.Chinaâ€™s influence in the Western Balkansâ€œThrough the Belt and Road Initiative, [China] is the largest lender to developing countries,â€ von der Leyen said on Thursday. In early December, the Commission president referred to Russia and China vying for influence in the Western Balkans, ""Wrangling is also noticeable in the Western Balkans – Russia is trying to exert influence, China is trying to exert influence,"" von der Leyen said on December 6 in Tirana, Albania.The EU wants to prevent other states such as Russia or China from gaining further influence in the Western Balkans. Among other things, these countries are trying to create dependencies through large-scale investments. In the European Union, this is viewed with great concern in many places, especially since the Balkan states lie in the middle of the EU and border on member states such as Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary and Croatia.China as a trading partner for Belgium, Bulgaria and SloveniaAs for Belgium, according to the Belgian Foreign Trade Agency, China was the country's 12th largest customer in 2022 (7.8 billion euros worth of exports) and its 4th largest supplier (35.3 billion euros in imports). This gives Belgium a negative trade balance of -27.5 billion euros in relation to China.China was Sloveniaâ€™s sixth most important trading partner in 2022 with EUR 5.3 billion in goods. Chinese direct investment increased in 2018, when the multinational firm Hisense took over household appliances maker Gorenje. Chinese investments usually originate from Chinese subsidiaries and branches in Luxembourg. They are currently valued at over EUR 300 million.As far as Bulgaria is concerned, there are no large Chinese investments in substantial local infrastructure projects. However, in 2022, China was the third most important source of imports to Bulgaria after Russia and Turkey. In January - November 2022, exports of goods from Bulgaria to third countries increased by 38 percent compared to the same time of 2021.Belgium started screening foreign investmentsAs asked by the European Commission in 2020, the federal and regional governments of Belgium decided to screen foreign investments that could hold a risk for Belgium's strategic autonomy in November 2022. The mechanism is aimed at preventing investors from outside the EU from gaining control, or becoming the owner or manager of critical infrastructure. The filter covers the following sectors: technology, the delivery of goods considered elementary for food security and energy, the access to and control of sensitive information, and media freedom and pluralism.By 1 July 2023, a screening committee will be put in place (consisting of representatives of all governments) to verify all investments that would give foreign actors a stake of at least 25 percent in a Belgian company. For investments in the defense or energy sectors, the threshold will be lowered to 10 percent.It is interesting in this context that when presenting the investment screening, Minister for Economy Pierre-Yves Dermagne explicitly referred to the intended investment by Chinese state-owned enterprise State Grid in the Belgian net operator Eandis in 2016. After the Belgian intelligence agency had warned of espionage and possible links between State Grid and the PRC's People's Liberation Army, the deal was cancelled, officially on competition grounds.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Belgium to purchase vacant European Commission offices,"The Belgian governmentâ€™s investment department plans to buy abandoned European Commission office spaces with a value of 1 billion euros. Slovakiaâ€™s parliament agreed on a common position concerning support for Ukraine. Bulgarian farmers demonstrate against duty free imports of Ukrainian agricultural products.Belgium to acquire European Commission offices worth 1 billion eurosBrussels (Belga) – The Federal Holding and Investment Company (SFPI-FPIM), the investment arm of the Belgian federal government, wants to take over 23 vacant European Commission buildings in Brussels, Belgian newspapers De Tijd and L'Echo reported on Thursday, based on sources involved in the discussions.The Belgian federal government and the European Commission have been in exclusive negotiations for several months over a real estate deal worth about 1 billion euros. The Commission wants to get rid of most of the buildings it owns, accounting for 350,000 square meters of office space in prime locations in the cityâ€™s Leopold district.Because a deal is in the works between a European institution and its host country, Belgium, the Commission does not have to organize a public tender. But the private sector will also play a role in the story. In a first phase, the SFPI will buy the buildings itself, but in a second phase it wants to tender the portfolio in tranches to renovate the buildings together with property developers. This will allow the FPIM to recover part of the estimated acquisition price of 1 billion euros.The sale should help the Commission achieve its ambitious environmental goals. It announced in 2021 that it would abandon half of its 50 office buildings in Brussels by 2030 because of growing remote work and greening offices. It does seem likely that the Commission will rent offices in some renovated buildings. Both the SFPI and the Commission are unwilling to comment for now. (March 30)Slovak Parliament approves countryâ€™s position on support for UkraineBratislava (TASR) – In a vote on Wednesday, members of Slovakiaâ€™s parliament approved the position of the Slovak Republic on support for Ukraine in the context of the military aggression of Russia. The parliament also asked the government to respect this position at national level and in negotiations and votes in the institutions and bodies of the European Union.The position shows that the Slovak Republic supports the provision of all-round assistance and support to Ukraine, which has an inalienable right to self-defense under the UN Charter in the event of an armed attack. With its position, Slovakia strongly condemns ""the unprovoked and unjustifiable military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine.""The position also shows that Slovakia supports the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders, as well as the sovereign right of Ukraine, its government and its citizens to decide on key issues for their future and national interest, including how and on what terms to settle the armed conflict and achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting peace.The position also declares that Slovakia will proceed adequately in the formulation of European policy in the context of Russia's military aggression against Ukraine and in the implementation of appropriate measures in the name of the stability and prosperity of its immediate neighborhood, the wider region and Europe. (March 30)Farmers in Bulgaria protest over agricultural imports from UkraineSofia (BTA) – Bulgarian grain farmers have launched a three-day national protest against the duty-free import of agricultural goods from Ukraine.The country's imports of sunflower seeds from Ukraine have increased 20-fold in a year, according to the Ministry of Agriculture. â€œNo economy can withstand such pressure. We need measures linked to European legislation, because we cannot solve this problem in Bulgaria. I would like it to be made clear in Brussels that the countries that are closer to the conflict in Ukraine are paying a much higher price, and solidarity in Europe must also be with its own farmers. I hope that Europe will react quickly,â€ said Bulgarian Agriculture Minister Yavor Gechev.Bulgaria produces about 2 million tons of sunflower seeds annually, no more than 5-10 percent of which have been sold so far, said the National Association of Grain Producers, the organizer of the protest.At the end of last week, the European Commission approved the first amounts of aid for Bulgarian farmers because of the impact of Ukrainian agricultural imports. Sofia is demanding an increase in European compensation. Bulgaria will demand an additional 50 million euros as compensation, local media reported. In a report from the European Commission on the short-term outlook for EU agricultural markets in 2023, the Commission acknowledged that increasing imports of agricultural goods from Ukraine negatively impact the Bulgarian market. (28-29 March)EU energy ministers in favor of extending gas cuts, with an exception for SloveniaBrussels (STA) – The EUâ€™s energy ministers reached a political agreement on Tuesday to extend the gas cut regulation until the end of March 2024. Between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024, the Member States will seek to reduce consumption by 15 percent compared to the average gas consumption between April 2017 and March 2022.The ministerial agreement grants Slovenia an exception, because it will largely replace coal with gas in the electricity supply and district heating of Ljubljana, in line with its climate targets.""The exception we have achieved is of great importance for us,"" said Slovenian Energy Minister Bojan Kumer, who supported the extension of the regulation, on the sidelines of the meeting. Without this exemption, the savings Slovenia achieved between August 2022 and March 2023 would be offset, said Kumer.This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

The EU is not spending 2.6-million euro on hamster breeding in Hungary,"Thousands of internet users appeared to believe that the EU may spend more than 2 million euros to finance hamster breeding in Hungary. Such a project was described in a poster whose photo was widely shared on Hungarian social media in March 2023. AFP found no trace of any such EU project for the â€œrehabilitation and artificial insemination of golden hamstersâ€ and confirmed that neither the address nor the company listed on the poster exists. While the Hungarian government has been suspected of irresponsible or irregular use of EU funds in the past, this particular example appears to be a case of satire.""This is no joke! National golden hamster rehabilitation... 1 billion... ,"" reads a Hungarian Facebook post shared by more than 1,700 users since 20 March, 2022. An image in the post shows an information poster that appears similar to those obligatory for projects using EU funds.Multiple users appear to believe that the poster shows a real EU project. ""While poor people have nothing to eat, have no firewood? It's all about stealing, that's why they ask Brussels for money. Shame!"" one user wrote in the comments below a similar post shared 2,500 times on Facebook.According to the image in the posts, the alleged project received over 1 billion HUF (2.6 million euros) in funding from the European Union and the Hungarian government for the ""rehabilitation and artificial insemination of golden hamsters"".While there have been controversial EU projects in Hungary over the years and the Hungarian government faces accusations of corruption, this poster appears to be satirical. AFP found no trace of such a project in official databases or any evidence of the existence of the company or its address listed on the poster.The misleading post on Facebook. screenshot taken on 21 March 2023No trace of the project or companyLooking closely at the poster of the alleged project, some suspicious details emerge.It says the project was part of the ""Ãšj SzÃ©chenyi Terv"" program, a governmental program for ""economic recovery and job creation"" that took place between 2011 and 2014. The design of the poster is similar to that of information boards for EU projects in that period. But the text on the poster claims that the project took place between 2019 and 2021, when the legally regulated design of EU projects was different, as can be seen below on the left.On the left is the official design for information boards for EU-funded projects between 2014 and 2020. On the right is the picture shared on social media using the old designIn addition, the regulatory body named on the poster appears to be fictional. The poster says the project was overseen by the ""National Strategic Development Agency"" but AFP could not find any trace of such an agency in an online search. There was a government body overseeing EU projects called ""National Agency for Development"", but it was abolished in 2014.A search of a database of projects in Hungary receiving EU funding also did not turn up any matches, even when trying different keyword searches or reading through all EU-funded projects in Nagymaros, where the poster says the alleged company receiving the investment is based. Only a handful of projects in the town were listed as receiving funding over 1 billion HUF and they were road and infrastructure projects -- nothing to do with hamsters.AFP also searched this database of Hungarian companies and found no company with the name of the alleged beneficiary named on the poster: ""Rodent Insemination Ltd.""The alleged company's address is listed on the poster as ""666 VÃ¶rÃ¶srÃ³zsa street, Nagymaros 2626"". While there is a VadrÃ³zsa street in Nagymaros, it does not officially have a building with the number ""666"". The number may have been chosen due to its biblical connotation, as it is often associated with evil and the occult in popular culture.According to the company database, there are seven active companies and private entrepreneurs with an official address on VadrÃ³zsa street in Nagymaros, plus two others which are no longer active. None of them shares a name with the alleged company from the project poster.Picture shared by a 'joke party'A Google search for the name of the project, the name of the company and its address all led to a 2020 Facebook post by the joke party Magyar KÃ©tfarkÃº KutyapÃ¡rt (MKKP) with the same image. MKKP is known for satirising governmental decisions, such as this parody version of the national consultation.MKKP has created similar mock-ups of such project posters in the past, but on those they clearly named themselves as creators.When reached for comment by AFP, the party's co-chair GergÅ‘ KovÃ¡cs confirmed the hamster poster was not their own work.""As much as we would like to, unfortunately we did not invent this one,"" KovÃ¡cs told AFP by email on 21 March, 2023.Real concerns about the spending of EU funds in HungaryWhile the hamster project appears to be satire, there are real concerns regarding EU funding in Hungary.Hungary is considered one of the most corrupt countries in the EU, according to Transparency International. As AFP reported in October 2022, the European Commission has voiced concerns about irregularities in the way public tenders are awarded in the country, the unusual number of solitary bids for those contracts, as well as poor oversight of conflicts of interest and bad follow-through on legal action in suspected fraud cases.In September 2022, the commission suggested that the European Council representing the EU member states suspend 65 percent of financing Hungary was to receive from three programmes, amounting to 7.5 billion euros.The European Anti-Fraud Office has also found irregularities in the spending of EU funds in Hungary on multiple occasions (here and here for example) and has suggested that the funds should be recovered.Ede ZaborszkyAll articlesAFP HungaryAll articlesFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: French sailing ship to examine impact of pollution on European coasts,"A French sailing vessel from the Tara Foundation studies the impact of pollution on biodiversity along the European coast. German Agriculture Minister Ã–zdemir campaigns against an EU ban on bottom trawl fishing. The European Parliament endorsed an agreement on salary transparency for companies.Tara Foundation examines the impact of pollution on European coastsLorient (AFP) – The French scientific schooner Tara left the French town of Lorient on Sunday for a new two-year expedition to examine the impact of pollution on biodiversity along the European coasts.The 13,780 nautical mile (25,520 km) journey, passing through the Atlantic, the English Channel, the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean, is part of a larger mission between land and sea called TREC (""Crossing Europe's Coasts"").The mission will mobilize several hundred researchers until July 2024, under the auspices of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL), based in Heidelberg (Germany).""The heart of the mission is to look at biodiversity and the presence of chemical pollutants in the ecosystem, and then to understand the interaction between the two,"" says Romain TroublÃ©, director of the Tara Foundation. (April 2, 2023)German Agriculture Minister Ã–zdemir stands up for crab fishermenBrussels (dpa) – In a dispute over EU plans to ban bottom trawling in protected areas, German Minister for Agriculture and Food Cem Ã–zdemir is backing crab fishermen. ""Scientific findings show that crab fishing is gentler on the seabed than other forms of bottom trawling,"" the German Green politician told the German Press Agency dpa.    The planned EU-wide ban increases the pressure on German fisheries, which have had to struggle with numerous problems in recent years. For example, catching herring, which is particularly important for Baltic Sea fishermen, is almost completely banned. Overfishing, nutrients being swept into waterways, especially from agriculture, and climate change are taking their toll on fish stocks. Restrictive fishing regulations have plunged German Baltic Sea fisheries into crisis.Ã–zdemir is campaigning against a general ban on bottom trawling. This is because the comparatively light nets used by crab fishermen would be deployed on finer substrates, so that the seabed and the species found there would recover more quickly than in the case of flatfish fisheries, for example. ""Blanket bans lead to a dead end from which the affected crab fishermen cannot escape,"" Ã–zdemir stressed. The environmental impacts of the different fisheries had to be considered in a differentiated way, he said.The European Commission had recently presented an action plan for more sustainable fishing. According to this plan, fishing with bottom trawls – i. e. nets that touch the seabed – should be prohibited in protected areas by 2030 at the latest. The first measures should be in place by the end of March 2024. There has been strong opposition to this in Germany, even though the European Commission's proposals are not new legislation. When asked, the Commission emphasized: ""There is no automatic or complete ban on bottom trawling that would come into force in March 2024."" (2 April)European Parliament approves agreement on wage transparency for companiesBrussels (Belga) – European companies will soon have to be transparent about their employees' pay. Part of the goal is to expose and eliminate any gender pay gap. On Thursday, the European Parliament overwhelmingly approved the agreement on the measure it reached earlier with member states.Under the directive, companies with 100 employees or more must disclose their individual and average pay levels, broken down by gender and by colleagues doing similar work. To protect individual employees from negative exposure due to a request for transparency, such a request can also be made through unions. Wage transparency should also be offered to job applicants.The primary purpose of the measure is to address the wage gap that still exists between men and women. In 2023, women in the European Union on average earn 13 percent less than men for the same work.If there appears to be a wage gap of at least 5 percent in a company that the employer cannot defend using objective and gender-neutral criteria, they will have to eliminate the gap. If companies continue to violate the rules willfully, EU member states will impose fines or other sanctions at the national level.The new directive was approved by 427 MEPs. 79 voted against, 76 abstained. (March 30)Close finish for the winners of parliamentary elections in BulgariaSofia (BTA) – Six political parties are expected to enter Bulgaria's National Assembly after voters were called to the polls for the fifth time in two years. The winner, with only a 2-percent margin of the votes, is the EPP member and Euro-Atlantic-leaning GERB-SDU coalition. The liberal coalition ""We Continue the Change - Democratic Bulgaria"" finished second.In third place comes the ""Revival"" party, which is challenging the country's membership in NATO and the EU and which saw a significant increase in support compared to the previous elections.Leading Bulgarian political observers foresee very complicated negotiations in the upcoming months, with a possibility of fresh early general elections in the fall - altogether with regular local power vote.

Sustainable fisheries? An EU action plan causes an outcry in member states,"The European Commission has recently presented an action plan for more sustainable fisheries. The aim is to ban fishing with bottom trawls in protected marine areas by 2030 at the latest. This caused strong opposition from some member states, which might lead to a watering down of the plan.Demonstrations, blocked portsâ€¦ The Commission's idea of banning trawling in all marine protected areas has triggered the ""dead ports"" protest movement of fishermen in France. Even though the Commissionâ€™s proposals are not new legislation – and their implementation does not come soon enough for some environmental NGOs – there has been strong opposition to this in some member states. Out of fear the ban would put the entire industry at risk, there were outcries from Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland and Denmark as well.The Commission's Marine Action Plan for sustainable fishing, announced on 21 February, includes initiatives for a phasing out of bottom trawling in protected marine areas. The measure aims to protect fish, shellfish, turtles and seabirds threatened by the use of mobile bottom trawling gear (trawls, dredges, longlines, traps) in areas that will cover up to 30 percent of European waters by 2030. The target is non-binding.The Commission states that fishing using certain mobile bottom-contact gear (mobile bottom fishing), in particular bottom trawling, is one of the most widespread and damaging activities to the seabed and its associated habitats. Currently, 79 percent of the coastal seabed is considered to be physically disturbed, mainly caused by bottom trawling, and a quarter of the EU's coastal area has probably lost its seabed habitats.Spain, Italy and Germany accuse Brussels of â€œdemonisingâ€ and â€œsimplifyingâ€ the impact of trawlingThe government in Spain recently accused Brussels of ""demonising"" trawling, arguing that trawling produces a sustainable yield and facilitates the recovery of fish stocks. The Spanish Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, Luis Planas, defended the need to find a balance between environmental, economic and social factors for the next common Fisheries Policy. Spain's disagreements with Brussels over the ban of trawling are not new. In 2022, the government appealed to the European Court of Justice against a Commission regulation, already in force, which imposed the closure of 87 trawl fishing grounds on the Atlantic coast.The Italian Minister of Agriculture, Francesco Lollobrigida, called at the AGRIFISH Council on 20 March for â€œa revision of the Action Planâ€, claiming that attributing bottom trawling â€œthe exclusive responsibility for the depletion of the seabed and fish resources is a simplification.â€ The revision of the plan should be carried out â€œin coordination with the Member States and the industry,â€ he added.Lollobrigida emphasized the importance â€œnot to penalize our fishing vessels with strict rules that cannot be applied to third countries,â€ meaning Southern Mediterranean countries. â€œIt is necessary to guarantee food security and sovereignty without ideological views that require a castrating attitude for our businesses compared to other nations in the same fishing water basins,â€ he added.In the dispute over the EU plans, German Minister for Agriculture and Food Cem Ã–zdemir is backing crab fishermen in Germany. â€œScientific findings show that crab fishing is gentler on the seabed than other forms of bottom trawling,â€ the German Green politician said.   German Minister for Food and Agriculture Cem Ã–zdemir (Alliance 90/The Greens), speaks during a rally on the fringes of the Conference of Agriculture Ministers. The reason for the protests was, among other things, the EU Commission's planned ban on bottom trawls in protected areas. Photo: Frank Molter/dpaÃ–zdemir is campaigning against a general ban, saying that the environmental impacts of the different fisheries had to be considered in a differentiated way. This is because the comparatively light nets used by crab fishermen would be deployed on finer substrates, so that the seabed and the species found there would recover more quickly than in the case of flatfish fisheries, for example. â€œBlanket bans lead to a dead end from which the affected crab fishermen cannot escape,â€ he said. However, Ã–zdemir also stressed that the efforts for sustainable fishing would have to be intensified, including more environmentally friendly rules for bottom trawls.Would a ban put the fishing industry at risk?The European Bottom Fisheries Alliance (EBFA) estimated that the ban would put ""7,000 vessels at risk,"" i. e. ""25 percent of the (fishing) volumes landed and 38 percent of the total income of the European fleet.â€According to the French National Fisheries Committee, such a measure would lead to the disappearance of nearly ""a third of the fleet,"" i. e. 4,000 fishermen on board 1,200 vessels in France.In Spain, 10 percent of vessels use trawling. The sector, led by the employers' association CEPESCA, has warned of the impact on the economy and employment that the Brussels ban would have.Restrictive fishing regulations have already plunged German Baltic Sea fisheries into crisis. The planned EU-wide ban would further increase the pressure on German fisheries, which have had to struggle with numerous problems in recent years. For example, catching herring, which is particularly important for Baltic Sea fishermen and is almost completely banned. Overfishing, nutrients being swept into waterways, especially from agriculture, and climate change are taking their toll on fish stocks.Croatia, on the other hand, launched a call to fishermen to participate in an initiative for the permanent cessation of fishing activities by destroying the fishing vessels or converting them to activities outside of commercial fishing. The measure is financed by the European Union, which covers 70 percent of the costs, the remaining 30 percent is borne by Croatia.A watered-down plan?The first measures should be in place by the end of March 2024. When asked, the Commission emphasized: â€œThere is no automatic or complete ban on bottom trawling that would come into force in March 2024.â€ The action plan for sustainable fisheries presented by the Commission ""only proposes guidelines to the Member States,"" said the French Secretary of State for the Sea HervÃ© Berville.""We will ask member states to give us a roadmap by 2024, we believe they are all aware of the need to make progress on sustainable fishing and the protection of ecosystems, especially in the Mediterranean,"" the Commission said, stressing that â€œmany fishermen depend on an intact seabed, but unfortunately this continues to deteriorate throughout Europe.""This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Austria warns against EU genetic engineering legislation,"Austrian ministers Gewessler and Rauch express their concerns about an upcoming EU proposal for genetic engineering. European Commissioner Thierry Breton announces his plans for a â€œcyber shieldâ€ and a â€œcyber reserve.â€ Belgian and German police raid the EPPâ€™s offices in Brussels as part of an ongoing investigation.Genetic engineering – Austria warns European Commission of risksBrussels (APA) – Austria's Environment Minister Leonore Gewessler and Johannes Rauch, the Minister responsible for consumer protection, have warned against the risks of New Genomic Techniques. In a letter to the European Commission, the two Green politicians demanded ""a safety assessment for genetically modified products and the retention of the labelling obligation,â€ as Rauch's ministry announced on Wednesday. The Commission intends to present its plans on New Genomic Techniques  on 7 June.""For consumers, this would mean that they would no longer be free to choose whether genetically modified products end up on their plates,"" the statement continued. In their letter to the responsible European Commissioner Stella Kyriakides, Gewessler and Rauch demanded ""strict regulation and the maintenance of the proven, clear rules for the protection of consumers and the environment.â€ There was also a need for ""further research into the effects on the environment and free access to seeds for farmers.""Rauch said that ""authorization, risk assessment and compulsory labelling must apply to so-called New Genomic Techniques.â€ Especially in the case of products ""that can have a variety of effects on humans, animals and the environment, a sufficient and balanced scientific foundation must be the basis of any new regulation,"" said Gewessler.Austrian environmental organizations welcomed this step. ""The Commission's plans on New Genomic Techniques are full of loopholes and ignore entire problem areas such as the environment and biodiversity, liability issues or patents,"" said Brigitte Reisenberger of GLOBAL 2000, according to a press release. According to Sebastian Theissing-Matei of Greenpeace Austria, there is also a need for ""complete labelling of genetically modified food.â€Florian Faber of ARGE Gentechnik-frei demands ""clear limits and control mechanisms, also for New Genomic Techniques.â€ ""Weakening the current mandatory labelling and traceability for New Genomic Techniques would endanger coexistence in agriculture and thus organic production as well as all other GMO-free production in Europe,"" warned BIO AUSTRIA chairwoman Gertraud Grabmann. (April 5)Europe to have a ""cyber shield"" and a ""cyber reserveâ€Paris (AFP) – To ensure that Europe can withstand major cyberattacks, such as those suffered by Ukraine, it plans to set up a ""cyber shield"", including a ""cyber reserve army"", European Commissioner Thierry Breton announced at the International Cyber Security Forum on Wednesday.These measures will be provided for in a new regulation, the ""Cyber Solidarity Act"", which Breton will present on 18 April.â€œOur ambition is to create a â€˜European cyber shieldâ€™ that will allow better detection of attacks upstream. Today, it takes an average of 190 days between the start of the spread of malware and the moment it is detected,"" said Breton, who is in charge of the Internal Market and Digital Affairs. ""We want to drastically reduce this time to a few hours,"" he said.The detection of attacks will be entrusted to a European network of six or seven SOCs (Cyber Security Operational Centres), also provided for in the Cyber Solidarity Act. (April 5)Police raid on European People's Party headquartersBrussels (Belga) – Belgian and German police raided the headquarters of the European People's Party (EPP) in Brussels on Tuesday, the party said. According to the EPP, the action is related to an ongoing investigation in the eastern German state of Thuringia.""The party cooperates in full transparency with the relevant authorities and provides all relevant information and documentation. As this is an ongoing judicial investigation, the EPP will not comment further,"" the party said in a statement.According to German public broadcaster MDR ThÃ¼ringen, the search is part of a corruption investigation into Mario Voigt, the chairman of the local branch of the Christian Democratic Party CDU. A spokesman for the public prosecutor in the state capital Erfurt confirmed that the operation took place at the request of the German authorities.Investigators are searching the EPP for information about its online election campaign ahead of the 2019 European elections. Voigt had been brought to Brussels at the time to lead that campaign. He is suspected of having received money from a local Thuringian company in exchange for it being awarded a contract as part of that online campaign.The EPP is the umbrella party of 81 Christian Democratic and Conservative parties from 43 countries.

"Incomplete map misleads on utility of EU, California banning new fossil fuel cars","The European Union recently gave final approval to a ban on sales of new cars with internal combustion engines from 2035. Linked to that decision is a world map that has been circulating on social media since late February and which shows Europe and California -- which announced similar rules -- in blue. The online posts argue that because these areas ""where sales of combustion engine vehicles will be banned in 2035"" represent ""1/16th of the world population,"" the new legislation will be useless in the fight against climate change. However, the map is incomplete: many other regions around the world have also announced such initiatives in recent years. What's more, the EU and California represent just over a fifth of the world's car fleet and have the potential to influence the rest of the world on the matter, experts told AFP. ""Shown in blue are the countries where sales of combustion engine vehicles will be banned in 2035. They represent 1/16th of the world population. Already I feel better with my clear conscience as a responsible European citizen,"" reads an online post shared more than 16,000 times since February 2023. Alongside the text is a world map on which California and the European Union appear in blue.The same map has been shared more than 2,000 times on Twitter with the following caption: ""Shown in blue are the countries where petrol cars will be banned in 2035!""The map has been circulating on social media since at least February 23, 2023, according to AFP's research. Screenshot taken on Facebook on March 29, 2023Screenshot taken on Twitter on March 29, 2023""I didn't realise it applied to this many people around the world,"" one commenter observed with irony, while another struck a note of indignation: ""And it's Europe that will change the climate?... They really take us for fools"".  Yet, someone else pointed out that ""it may represent 1/16th of the world population (I didn't check), but it's way more than 1/16th of cars because the countries in question are the most industrialised"". On March 28, 2023, EU member states gave final approval to a ban on sales of new internal combustion engines -- those that run on fossil fuel -- from 2035. The agreement ensures that new cars and vans will be zero-emission by then, which effectively prohibits sales of petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles to the benefit of everything electric.California announced similar legislation in 2020, and adopted it in August 2022. All new cars sold there will have to be zero emission from 2035, according to the text adopted by America's most populous state. Only vehicles that run on electricity or hydrogen and certain hybrids will be allowed, which translates to a ban on sales of new petrol or diesel cars from 2035. Does not apply to existing fossil fuel vehiclesSome of those who shared the map online (here for example) claim that the countries in blue will ban combustion engine vehicles altogether in 2035. But according to the European Parliament's FAQ on the subject, ""these rules don't affect existing cars. If you buy a new car now, you can drive it until the end of its lifespan. But, because the average lifespan of a car is 15 years, we have to start in 2035 to aim for all cars to be CO2-neutral by 2050."" The FAQ adds that it will still be possible to buy and sell second-hand petrol and diesel-driven cars after 2035. A press release from California's governor issued on September 23, 2020 also said that ""the executive order will not prevent Californians from owning gasoline-powered cars or selling them on the used car market"".  Thus the new laws do not ban petrol or diesel cars. Their owners will be able to continue to drive them or to sell them second-hand after 2035, but motorists will no longer be able to buy the vehicles new.Incomplete mapThe map suggests that only the European Union and California plan to ban sales of new combustion engine vehicles starting 2035. Yet, several other areas around the world -- listed in this AFP article from March 2023 -- have announced similar goals. The trailblazer is Norway, the leading adopter of electric vehicles, where only zero-emission new vehicles will be sold from 2025. Zero emission legislationIn addition to California, the state of New York also announced in 2022 that it would ban the sale of new fossil fuel cars, except for plug-in hybrids -- which have internal combustion engines but can cover dozens of kilometres in full electric mode -- from 2035. The Canadian government said in 2021 that it was ""setting a mandatory target for all new light-duty cars and passenger trucks sales to be zero-emission by 2035.""Singapore, Israel and the United Kingdom will ban registrations of new combustion engine vehicles in 2030. An electric car is being charged at a terminal in a parking lot in Lille, northern France, on September 27, 2022Partial targets from other governmentsIn the United States, in 2021 President Joe Biden announced a target for half of all cars sold in the US to be zero-emission by 2030. According to the International Energy Agency, in 2020 electric vehicles only represented two percent of new car sales in the US. Major car manufacturer Japan plans to take its time to shift to electric vehicles and is favouring hybrids, of which Toyota is the world champion. The government plans to ban the sale of fossil fuel vehicles except for hybrids in the 2030s. China, which is the world's top polluter with the world's largest auto market, aims for new energy vehicles (battery electric, hybrid and fuel cell vehicles) to account for 20 percent of sales in 2025, and for a majority by 2035. Like China, which ""has a more prescriptive policy and is already ahead of Europe with regard to going electric,"" certain countries are moving forward quickly even without binding legislation, according to Marie Cheron, a transportation expert at the Europe-based association Transport & Environment, who was interviewed by AFP on March 24, 2023. As mentioned in the MIT Technology Review, China has had the world's leading market for electric cars for the past eight years, with 6.8 million electric vehicles sold there in 2022. The map is thus incomplete and misleading, according to sustainability expert Augustin Fragniere, of the University of Lausanne of Switzerland. ""In addition to total bans, there is also a whole set of economic incentives: taxes that make fossil fuels more costly, electric vehicle subsidies, etc. To focus only on a specific date and ban on sales of combustion engine vehicles is to provide incomplete information,"" he told AFP on March 28, 2023. As mentioned in the above AFP article, some emerging countries have also taken steps to limit fossil fuel vehicles, though they have weak sales of new cars and electric vehicles remain expensive. EU, California with a fifth of the world's car fleetAccording to the logic of the online posts, if California and the European Union only represent 1/16th of the world population, then policies aimed at going electric will not have much of an impact on climate change.Yet, according to Cheron, comparing these regions with the rest of the world in terms of population is ""irrelevant"". Instead, she suggests looking at the number of vehicles circulating in Europe and California, which represent ""much more than 1/16th"" of the world's total number of cars. The total number of motor vehicles (passenger and commercial) in the European Union reached 286 million in 2021, or 338 million if you include the UK, Norway, Switzerland and Iceland, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. Ninety-three percent of passenger cars in the European Union ran on petrol or diesel. In 2021, 31 million motor vehicles -- including 14 million automobiles -- were registered in California, making it the largest car market in the United States and one of the largest in the world, according to the Statista data agency. In 2021, the EU and California had between the two of them around 317 million passenger cars and commercial vehicles -- from a world total of 1.4 billion vehicles according to Cheron -- or just over a fifth of the world's car fleet. ""These regions may represent 1/16th of the world population, but it's a population that emits more than the global average,"" Fragniere said. The US -- with California at the top -- China and the European Union are the leading emitters of CO2 linked to transportation, according to data compiled by Climate Watch, a platform by the World Resources Institute.A spokeswoman for the International Council on Clean Transportation NGO agreed that the map seemed ""not entirely accurate"". ""A more meaningful approach would be to consider the market share of ICE (internal combustion engine) vehicles or the motorisation rate (motor vehicles in use per 1,000 people) in these countries. This would help to determine the potential impact of the ban,"" she said on March 20, 2023. This map from the site Our World In Data shows that the US, Europe, Canada and Australia had the highest car ownership in 2017. In 2021, Europe had 567 passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants.  ""North America and Europe are the regions that have emitted by far the most greenhouse gas since the industrial revolution,"" Fragniere said on March 28, 2023. ""So they have historical responsibility.""Ripple effect""Not only is acting upon Europe's car fleet far from insignificant when you consider its share of the global total, but it is also the case that European policy can influence the rest of the world auto industry,"" Cheron said. ""There is a very clear ripple effect,"" said Fragniere. ""When California began introducing stricter CO2 emission standards for vehicles, it had an effect on the entire American car market. Manufacturers aligned themselves with the more demanding Californian standards to avoid having to make two types of vehicles,"" he added. ""If the entire EU bans all combustion engines, local car industries will have to adapt, but so will every carmaker that exports there,"" Fragniere said.Marie GenriesTous ses articlesAFP BelgiqueTous ses articlesTranslated by  Anna Maria JakubekCLIMATFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

EU sustainable pesticide ambitions put European farmers in a tough spot,"How much exposure to agricultural chemicals can Europe's environment take? The dispute over the use of pesticides has been fermenting since plans for a substantial reduction were presented in Brussels. Proponents and opponents both claim: if they are not listened to, the food supply is in danger.In the summer of 2022, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal that, among other things, provides for reducing the use and risks of chemical pesticides by 50 percent by 2030.The European Commissionâ€™s proposal is met with resistance from several EU member states. While some recognise the significance of the measures to protect the environment, others sound the alarm regarding the impact on their individual agricultural industries and European food security as a whole.Green MEP Sarah Wiener, however, is pushing for much stricter rules in the dispute over a significant reduction of pesticides in European agriculture. In a report, she proposed, among other things, more taxes on pesticides, a stronger reduction of particularly dangerous pesticides and compromises on the total ban of chemicals in very sensitive areas. For example, Wiener proposed that the ban should include exceptions for organic pesticides.Will the European Commissionâ€™s ambitions to protect the environment prevail over EU-wide concerns about the negative impact on the agricultural sector and European food security?Croatia positive, but foresees country-specific reduction targetsThe Croatian Ministry of Agriculture stated that it was necessary to speed up and facilitate the registration process of alternative plant protection products at EU level and the introduction on the market of plant protection products that contain biologically active substances, for which financial assistance to the member states is provided.The Croatian Ministry of Agriculture also believes that the regulation should prescribe a common methodology for all member states, based on which the European Commission would calculate their progress and compare them to the EU average. On the basis of this data, the national reduction goal for the use of pesticides for each member state would be determined. Quantitative national targets for reducing the use of pesticides would be specified as part of the National Action Plan for achieving a sustainable use of pesticides.Furthermore, Croatia believes that it is necessary to encourage the transition to alternative, more sustainable methods of protection, i. e. to encourage research in this segment, ensure adequate availability of biological agents and strengthen financial support at EU level for additional investments in alternative methods or means.The calls to implement country-specific assessments of the impact of a reduced use of chemical pesticides are, albeit more strictly, echoed by other member states, which believe the European Commission should not lump their respective agricultural sectors together.Concerns for food security at the coreOn that note, Slovenia opposes the regulation on a sustainable use of pesticides or plant protection products entering into force, mainly because it does not take into account the differences between member statesâ€™ agricultural sectors. Slovenian farmers, who gathered for a mass protest at the end of March, called for the government to reject the regulation. They said that the proposal was â€œcatastrophicâ€, as the areas it covers in Slovenia account for half of the country and 40 percent of its total agricultural land.During the negotiations, Slovenia had proposed a different methodology to be implemented, one that would take into account how much each country contributes to the European average in terms of the use of plant protection products. Among those opposing the drastic reduction in the use of pesticides is MEP Franc BogoviÄ of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP). He has tabled a series of amendments to revise the regulation and lower the reduction target. He also called for an impact assessment of the proposed regulation on food security to be carried out for each country, arguing that the regulation as it currently stands could seriously jeopardise the countriesâ€™ food security.In Germany, the proposal took farmers to the streets to demonstrate with about 200 tractors in Bonn. German MEPs of the Christian Democratic CDU/CSU alliance expressed understanding for the protests. German MEP Norbert Lins also criticised the intended complete ban of pesticides in certain protected areas.Emphasis on countriesâ€™ individual conditionsThe Association of the Romanian Plant Protection Industry (AIPROM) argues that the methodology for pesticide reduction targets should continue to be based on usability and risk, but should also take into account the country-specific agricultural environments, historical achievements and the different starting points for each member state.""Romania, through the National Phytosanitary Authority, considers that the proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products drafted by the European Commission must prioritise food security and safety for European citizens over the ambitions of protecting the environment,â€ Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development Petre Daea said.Italy, along with a majority of member states, asked the Commission for additional data to review the impact on production of the proposal to halve the use of pesticides by 2030. On the reduction of pesticides ""we need to open a serious reflection and implement research,"" so that ""the decrease of pesticides corresponds to an action to replace them,"" Italian Minister for Agriculture Francesco Lollobrigida said on the sidelines of the EU Council Summit in December 2022.Ever since the European Commission made its initial proposal last summer, Spain expressed reservations about the idea of reducing the use of chemical pesticides by 2030. The Spanish government called for farmers to have sufficient alternatives to these pesticides before implementing the new restriction. In addition, the Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Luis Planas, defended the need to make the preservation of the environment compatible with the economic activity of agriculture, which is a key sector for many rural areas of the country.Serbia aims to harmonise with EU pesticide rulesIn Serbia, which has been a candidate for EU membership since 2008, farmers who use incentives from pre-accession funds sign a contract in which they undertake to respect all EU standards on their farms, so that the use of pesticides, their quantity, method of application, storage, and waste management are monitored. The goal is to get all farmers to commit to this in order to obtain a realistic picture of the quantity of chemical pesticides that are still being used and how.""Our list of permitted preparations is still not 100 percent harmonised with the EU, which is what we are aiming for, and every year a certain number of preparations are deleted from the list,â€ Milenko Jovanovic from the Serbian Association of Young Farmers (SUMP) said. â€œThe goal is to be fully harmonised with the EU in approximately 3 to 5 years, but the fact that this harmonisation will be accompanied by new additional restrictions will have a negative effect on the mood of farmers, because they will make production more expensive and more difficult. Every year is more and more challenging in terms of crop protection,â€ Jovanovic pointed out.This article is published Fridays. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Europe in brief: Croatia to use next-generation EU loans,"Croatia plans to request a loan from the European Commission to finance projects in energy and education, among others. Furthermore, the Commission considers Romania to be one of 11 countries to increase production capacities in defence. Austria opposes the introduction of an EU gigabit levy and the German Economic Minister calls for stricter control of sanctions against Russia.Croatia decides to use next-generation EU loansZagreb (HINA) – Croatia will ask the European Commission for an additional 3.6 billion euros in the form of a loan under the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) for projects in energy, water supply and drainage, education and reconstruction after the earthquake in 2020, the Croatian daily newspaper Jutarnji list reported on Thursday. This information was confirmed to the daily by the Croatian Prime Minister's special advisor for the economy and chief coordinator for the NRRP,  Zvonimir SaviÄ‡.In addition to the existing 5.5 billion euros approved as grants, Croatia will have 9.1 billion euros available with the mentioned loan until the middle of 2026, when all investments and reforms must be completed. Perhaps the most strategically important of the projects that will be negotiated with the Commission and could be financed from the loan is the one related to gasification, that is, the construction of a gas pipeline from the LNG terminal on the Croatian island of Krk to Slovenia, Austria, Germany and Hungary.About 800 million euros from the loan will also be used for existing NRRP projects. Because the GDP had grown, the grants for recovery and resilience were reduced from the originally approved 6.3 to 5.5 billion euros. (13 April)Breton: Romania among the countries to increase production capacities in defenceBucharest (AGERPRES) – The European Commission has identified 15 companies from 11 countries that could increase their production capacity for the defence industry. Romania is one of these countries, said European Commissioner for the Internal Market, Thierry Breton, who visited two subsidiaries of Romaniaâ€™s National Defence Company, Romarm.â€œWe decided, together with the Ministries of Defence and the European Commission, to launch an important tender, worth more than one billion euros, to buy the ammunition that is needed, and we want to do so with the defence industry in Europe,â€ Breton said in a conference at the end of the visit, noting that partnerships and joint ventures were encouraged in this context.Breton explained that there were three pillars of support for member states and entities in relation to existing requests to supply ammunition to Ukraine, ""The first is a billion euros that we are using from the European Peace Facility to reimburse member states that donate part of their own ammunition stockpile (...). The second pillar is another one billion euros with which we would like to launch a tender for European defence industry companies. The third pillar is to make sure that we can strengthen and increase the capacity of the defence industry to respond to these requests, and here I am about to finalise an instrument if we conclude that we need more financial support, including to invest in new production lines.â€The EU official added that he will, in the coming weeks, propose legislation to Commission President Ursula von der Leyen with the aim of increasing the capacity to collaborate and to have a financial bolster to be able to offer grants to promising projects. (12 April)Austrian government against â€œfair shareâ€ for Netflix & Co at EU levelVienna (APA) – There has been a long-standing debate in the EU as to whether and how Netflix, Google and other internet service providers should be asked to pay more for their data-intensive business to internet service providers. In the discussion about â€œfair shareâ€, Austria will in any case speak out against the introduction of a gigabit levy at European level, said the Austrian State Secretary for Digitalization Florian Tursky.â€œFor two reasons: Service providers could simply make their offers more expensive and consumers would then pay twice – through higher prices for services and through their internet contracts. I also see net neutrality at risk as a result of such an additional levy,â€ says Tursky, who received support from the Greens.The warning did not apply to free services for end customers such as Google or YouTube, but to paid services such as Netflix, which would probably pass the additional costs on to consumers, the State Secretary said. According to the State Secretariat, consumer costs for the internet provider would not increase, but they would potentially have to bear the added passed on costs of content providers.The EU Commission is currently issuing a public consultation on the fair share debate with a submission deadline on 19 May. There had been demands for such taxation since 2012, when the proposal was rejected as unfair and impracticable, explained Tursky. France and Spain are currently in favour of such a levy. Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Belgium, for example, are against. (8 April)German Economic Minister: Stop trickery in sanctions against RussiaBerlin (dpa) – According to Minister of Economic Affairs Robert Habeck (Greens), the German authorities must take stronger action against companies in Germany that do business with Russia via third countries and thus circumvent EU sanctions. Since the start of the Russian war against Ukraine, a good 13 months ago, the EU has launched ten packages of sanctions against Russia, which include trade restrictions and other measures.Habeck said that Germany could learn from Denmark, for example, in the fight against the illegal circumvention of these sanctions. Customs in that country were analysing trade flows and customs data very closely for anomalies. ""If such anomalies appear, for example when a large quantity of certain goods that previously went to Russia is now suddenly to be delivered in pretty much the same quantity to another third country, that's a reason to take a closer look."" As a next step, the Danish Customs office asks companies to explain the reason for the anomaly. ""German foreign trade law also recognises such requests for information and these inspection powers. If this is used in a targeted way, we can strengthen the joint clout of our authorities,"" said Habeck.At the end of February, his ministry had proposed concrete steps to better counteract the evasion of sanctions. ""We are currently discussing these in the Federal Government and with our EU partners,"" Habeck said. (8 April)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"This video does not show an MEP, but a former German lawmaker in 2020","A video from 2020 of a former member of the German parliament has been shared thousands of times since March by internet users who claim that the man in question is an MEP doing cocaine during a session of the European Parliament. In reality, the man in the video -- which was filmed at the Bundestag -- is no longer a lawmaker and was never an MEP. While it is impossible to verify exactly what he was consuming in the video, he has spoken in the past of his fondness for snuff tobacco. ""There's a video causing a stir within the #EU which involves alleged cocaine use at the European Parliament,"" claims a tweet with a video of a man in a suit placing something on his hand -- between his thumb and index finger -- and inhaling it. He is next shown slouching in his seat and smiling. The video has been retweeted nearly 3,000 times since March 25, 2023. It was also shared on Facebook with the caption, ""A parliamentarian does drugs during a session of the European Parliament!! We now have a better understanding of how laws are passed."" The video was viewed more than 3,000 times on Telegram. Screenshot taken on Twitter on April 12, 2003          .............                      Screenshot taken on Facebook on April 12, 2023In reality, the video was not filmed at the European Parliament and the man shown has never been an MEP. Instead, he is a former German lawmaker who has called himself a fan of snuff tobacco.Former German lawmaker, not MEPA reverse video search using the InVid tool -- explained here -- turned up the same video but in better quality on TikTok. It shows a man in a suit putting brown powder onto his hand and snorting it. In the posts circulating on Twitter and Facebook, the poor quality of the video makes it impossible to get a clear view of the powder or its colour.The TikTok video description includes the hashtags #bundestag, #jensmaier and #tabak.A member of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party since 2013, Jens Maier sat in the Bundestag (the lower house of the German paliament) between 2017 and 2021. He is no longer a lawmaker. A Google image search confirms that he is the man who appears in the video. Maier was ordered by a court in 2019 to pay damages over a racist tweet. Three years later, he was sent into early retirement from his job as a judge at the regional court of Dresden, notably because of remarks he had made that were deemed racist. His archived biography on the Bundestag site (which is not up to date) does not mention him having ever been an MEP. The independent German site Abgeordnetenwatch.de, which allows German citizens to submit questions to their parliamentary representatives, says that Maier has no current mandate, nor is he a candidate for a position at home or in the EU. A Google search for ""Jens Maier"" and ""European Parliament"" in French, English and German turns up various articles on Maier from recent years (1, 2, 3) but none of them mention that he was an MEP or had ever even visited the European Parliament.A search of the name ""Jens Maier"" on the European Parliament site turns up no results. Neither does it appear on lists of MEPs from the current parliament (2019-) or the previous one (2014-2019).The European Parliament's press service told AFP on April 14, 2023 that ""we were able to confirm that the video does not show a member of the European Parliament, nor was it filmed at the European Parliament. The claims that it relays are false"". Video from the German parliament in 2020A Google search for ""Jens Maier"" and ""cocaine"" produces several articles published by other fact-checkers, including one from Euronews, which mentions a video report posted on March 9, 2023 to the YouTube channel of Germany's public broadcaster network ARD. Focused on radical members of the AfD, the report brings up Jens Maier at the 4:50 minute mark. Four seconds later there is the same video clip that has been circulating online.https://youtu.be/pz6QSX9hy-AThe MDR, the broadcaster from the ARD network that produced the video report, told AFP on April 11, 2023 that it pulled the video clip of Maier from footage of a debate at the Bundestag on November 6, 2020. A search on the Bundestag site confirms that Maier was indeed at the debate that day. Footage of the debate is available on the site of German public broadcaster Phoenix, which notably broadcasts the plenary sessions of the Bundestag. The clip that has been circulating online appears at the 6:03 minute mark. It shows Maier going through the same motions, with a pin on the lefthand side of his blazer, an open booklet in front of him and the two objects to his left and right. He is also sitting in the same place, on a blue chair in front of a black table. The word ""Bundestag"" appears in the upper righthand corner of the video on the Phoenix site. Screenshot taken on Twitter, on April 13, 2023            ..............                      Screenshot taken on the website Phoenix, on April 13, 2023 Nor do the chairs and tables in that video resemble those of the European Parliament chambers in Brussels and Strasbourg (where the chairs are black and the tables blue). Snuff tobaccoWhile it is not possible to verify exactly what the lawmaker was consuming in the video, he mentioned his fondness for snuff tobacco, or ""Schnupftabak,"" in a German television interview in August 2017. He goes through the same motions in other videos including one (at the 5:31 minute mark) posted to Phoenix's YouTube channel on June 19, 2020.Snuff is powdered tobacco -- often with flavouring -- that is snorted into the naval cavity. The box held by Maier in the video strongly resembles one marketed by the German snuff brand Bernard.Marie GenriesTous ses articlesAFP BelgiqueTous ses articlesTranslated byAnna Maria JakubekEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

"Europe in brief: EU rules on AI needed soon, German digital minister says","German Digital Minister Volker Wissing calls for the creation of a legal framework for the use of artificial intelligence. In Washington, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina reports a reduced exposure to market risks after 2022. The European Commission is working on a new programme to stop migrant smuggling in North Africa.German digital minister calls for timely EU rules on artificial intelligenceBerlin (dpa) – There are calls in the German government to quickly create rules for the use of artificial intelligence (AI). On Thursday, German Digital Minister Volker Wissing told the newspaper Bild, ""We must react wisely now and regulate artificial intelligence sensibly before it is too late. This must not take years again."" He called for a European legal framework to be created quickly.Currently, the speech-imitating text software ChatGPT, Google's competing software Bard, as well as programmes that can generate images based on text descriptions, are causing a big stir. At the same time, there are concerns that such AI-based technology could be misused, for example, to spread false information.A spokeswoman of the German Interior Ministry told the newspaper Handelsblatt, ""It is essential to strike a balance between openness to innovation and a clear legal framework that defines standards for trustworthy AI.â€ To what extent certification could play a role remained to be seen, she added. Within the framework of the EU regulation on AI, the German government had advocated to make the use of certain high-risk AI systems by the public administration transparent through a publicly accessible database.At the same time, the head of the German Social Democrats, Saskia Esken, countered fears that AI could lead to job losses. ""There is this fear with every technological leap, and yet so far more new jobs have always been created than replaced,"" she said. Moreover, there was already a huge shortage of skilled workers. However, AI should not be misused for surveillance in the workplace, she added. (April 16)The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina reduced its exposure to market risksWashington (FENA) – At the Spring Session of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank Group (WB) in Washington, the Governor of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH), Senad SoftiÄ‡, said that the CBBH overcame the challenging year 2022 and reduced its exposure to market risks by restructuring its portfolio.SoftiÄ‡ pointed out that small countries like BiH could not do much to counteract the rise of international tensions or the increase of interest rates throughout the world, and that the best thing they could do was to prepare for external shocks and increase their own resilience by ensuring there were no significant macroeconomic imbalances, especially in the fiscal area.In this regard, timely structural reforms, as the governor emphasised, are of exceptional importance for BiH. For a currency board like the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the best policy is to stick to basic principles as a guarantee of stability.At the Spring Meeting of the IMF and the World Bank, central bank officials and finance ministers of member countries gather to discuss the global situation, including the world economic outlook, poverty eradication and economic development. (April 16)EU works on new programme to counteract migrant smuggling in North AfricaBrussels (ANSA) – ""The European Commission has started working on a new regional programme to counteract migrant smuggling and human trafficking in North Africa. The initiative will support specific activities against smuggling, particularly in Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia,"" the Commission told the Italian news agency ANSA. European Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson will visit Tunisia at the end of April to â€œdiscuss migration management with the support of the EUâ€ and put into practice the operational partnership proposed at the last Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels.According to reports in Tunisia, the Commission intends to discuss the prevention of irregular departures, with a focus on the launch of an anti-trafficking partnership, increased search and rescue operations, repatriations and reintegration (from Tunisia to sub-Saharan Africa) and the strengthening of legal migration opportunities by member states.The EU executive is ""aware"" of the ""particularly complicated"" situation in the central Mediterranean and recalls that, for the short term, the Action Plan presented last November puts in place ""a comprehensive approach with operational and financial measures"" to address the challenges at stake. ""The Commission is coordinating the implementation of the Action Plan and is in close contact with Italy, the other member states and the agencies providing support on the ground,"" a spokesperson stated.

The strategy will be open for public consultation until 10 May.State Secretary at the Ministry of Economy MatevÅ¾ FrangeÅ¾ explained that the draft of the Slovenian Space Strategy brings together all the country's ambitions in the field of space in one place. ""Slovenia is small on Earth, but wants to become big in space,"" he stressed.Gordon Campbell of ESA also highlighted Slovenia's ""undoubtedly impressive"" achievements in space. The small size of the country was an advantage in this case, he said, which was reflected, among other things, by the facilitation of cross-sectoral cooperation. A well-developed strategy was also important, he said, because it made it easier and quicker for ESA to identify a country's potential. Slovenia was already well recognised in ESA, he pointed out.The draft strategy includes five strategic pillars to support the development of the sector. The first three are aimed at developing programme priority areas. These are the promotion and development of space technologies and research and development, cooperation in international space exploration and research, and space applications. The remaining two pillars are aimed at creating favourable conditions for the further development of the space sector. (April 13)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Fit for 55: En route to climate neutrality by 2050?,"The Fit for 55 package is seen as an important instrument to combat global warming, with proponents even calling it the ""biggest climate protection law ever"". Now the European Parliament has given the green light for the central legislation of the package.The EU wants to reduce its carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 55 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and become climate neutral by 2050. In Strasbourg on Tuesday, the European Parliament voted by a large majority in favour of the three areas considered the centrepiece of the ""Fit for 55"" package: emissions trading, the climate social fund and the CO2 tariff. All three were presented by the European Commission in the summer of 2021 to counteract climate change.German MEP Peter Liese (EPP, right), the rapporteur responsible for the report, spoke of the ""biggest climate protection law of all time."" Although almost all member states are on board when it comes to a greener future, the regulations and targets pose challenges.https://twitter.com/peterliese/status/1648311490938585093Key legislation: Emission trading rules, no more â€œclimate dumpingâ€Emissions trading is a key instrument for European climate protection. Companies have to buy pollution certificates if they emit CO2. This is supposed to create an incentive to produce less of it. The system is now being tightened, with the number of pollution allowances to be reduced faster than previously planned.This is also intended to motivate non-EU countries to increase their climate protection targets. From 2034 onwards, producers abroad will also have to pay for CO2 emissions if they want to sell their goods in the EU. The measure aims to ensure that climate protection efforts are not undermined by shifting production out of the EU to countries with more lax regulations. The rules apply to iron, steel, cement and aluminium, but also to fertilisers, electricity or hydrogen. Anyone who wants to import these goods must make up for the difference between the CO2 price paid in the country of production and the higher price of CO2 allowances in the EU emissions trading system.""The CO2 border adjustment strengthens the â€˜polluter pays principleâ€™ as the basis for a sustainable industrial policy. Such a mechanism protects the European market from carbon leakage by third countries with weaker environmental standards,"" praised German MEP Delara Burkhardt, the spokeswoman on environmental policies for the German Social Democrat delegation in the European Parliament.â€œBy extending the Emission Trading Scheme (ETS) to new sectors, strengthening its instruments and abolishing free emission allowances, we will ensure that the EU's biggest polluters will have to abandon old practices and switch to clean technologies, processes and products,"" the Slovenian Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy said with regard to the border-based carbon adjustment mechanism on Wednesday.In the summer of 2022, Spain had proposed a cap on the CO2 emission allowances mechanism designed to encourage pollution reduction and make the sectors that emit the most greenhouse gases pay.â€œThe CO2 border adjustment strengthens the â€˜polluter pays principleâ€™ as the basis for a sustainable industrial policy.""German MEP Delara BurkhardtFrance, Spain, Germany: Committed with reservations?While France is committed to reducing its emissions by 40 percent by 2030 compared to 1990, the country is lagging behind on its renewable energy deployment targets for the 2019-2023 period and relies heavily on nuclear power for its decarbonisation efforts, even though this form of energy is not unanimously supported within the EU.Furthermore, rising energy prices and the phasing out of free CO2 emission allowances in Europe are threatening more than 150,000 industrial jobs in France, stated pro-industry think-tank La Fabrique de lâ€™Industrie in a study earlier this April. If the introduction of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) was once considered favourably as a means of putting an end to the ""climate dumping"" of certain commercial powers, industrialists point to the shortcomings of the system: they argue in particular that the CBAM will only tax entries into the European domestic market and will weigh on the competitiveness of European exports ""in the face of foreign competition that will not have suffered the same upstream carbon costs.â€While Spain supports the package, there is still a long way to go: In 2021, Spain's gross carbon dioxide emissions amounted to 288.6 million tonnes. While this is similar to the 290.1 million tonnes emitted in 1990, and well below the 2007 peak of 446.7 million tonnes, Spain needs to cut emissions more strongly. In September 2022, the main opposition party in Spain, Partido Popular, proposed a substantial price reduction of CO2 emission rights at the European level on a temporary basis or, if necessary and agreed to, the suspension of their application for a few months.After the vote, Olaf in der Beek, member of the German Bundestag and climate policy spokesman for the German FDP parliamentary group, spoke of a ""good day for climate protection in Europe.â€ However, in der Beek still sees room for improvement: the next step in Germany, he said, is for the national system of CO2 pricing to develop into a genuine emissions trading system with a fixed CO2 cap from 2024. Bulgaria urges importance of legal frameworkAt the informal meeting of the European Union Ministers for the Environment in Stockholm earlier this week, Bulgariaâ€™s position took challenges for businesses into account.According to Bulgaria, action is needed to increase European production capacities for green technologies and the competitiveness of EU industry. This could be done by minimising the administrative burden for both industry and the public sector, accelerating access to financing and encouraging investment in the construction of zero-emission industrial zones.Looking at preserving and increasing its competitiveness, the country underlines the importance of a stable and predictable legal framework.EU accession candidate Serbia harmonises its decarbonisation goalsThe Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy, Dubravka ÄedoviÄ‡, stated that the goal for the countryâ€™s economy is to be decarbonised by 2050. According to her, Serbia wants to harmonise its goals with the EU goals as much as possible ""One is the share of renewable energy sources in electricity production, our goal is a 45 percent share in 2030, and it is realistic and achievable. As for the share of renewable energy sources in gross final consumption, this is something that we are now trying to harmonise. My expectations are that it will be more than 30 percent and less than 40 percent of the share,"" said ÄedoviÄ‡ and added that the country had to be ambitious, but realistic. According to her, seven years is not a long period for energy projects, as they require both time and large funds. In addition, care must be taken to ensure a fair transition, primarily for workers in the mining sector.Climate social fund against higher costs, partly funded by emission trading revenueHigher costs for consumers due to the energy transition, such as rising heating costs, are to be cushioned by a fund worth 86.7 billion euros from 2026. The climate social fund can be used to relieve households or finance investments, for example in more efficient buildings or public transport. Three-quarters of the fund will be financed by revenue from emissions trading and one-quarter by the Member States.The fund will ensure that the costs of the green transition are not disproportionately borne by the EU's socially most vulnerable citizens, the Slovenian Ministry of Environment, Climate and Energy stated.However, the social policy spokesman for Germanyâ€™s right wing AfD group in the EU Parliament, Guido Reil, criticised the climate social fund as ""an indirect admission that the EU's climate policy is an elite project that places a greater burden on the weaker and poorer members of society in particular.""The EU Member States still have to approve the plans, but this is considered a formality.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Slovenian NGOs slam bear cull authorisation,"NGOs warn that Sloveniaâ€™s decision to eliminate 230 bears is in breach of national and European law. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not in a migrant crisis, the countryâ€™s authorities claim. European Commissioner Marija Gabriel attends the opening of Serbiaâ€™s new BioSens Institute building.NGOs: Slovenia's large-scale bear cull is in breach of European lawLjubljana (STA) – Slovenian NGOs say that the culling quota of 230 brown bears, set by experts from forest and nature conservation institutes and approved by the Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Ministry on Thursday, is in breach of Slovenian and European legislation. They have notified the European Commission and European Parliament in an open letter.EU law does not allow culling permits for protected species like brown bears, but only allows for the culling of individual specimen, the animal welfare NGOs Lajka and AniMa and environment protection NGO Alpe Adria Green wrote in the open letter. The NGOs believe the EU Court of Justice should take action against Slovenia and ""correctly interpret the law in relation to culling.""The Association of Ecological Movements of Slovenia also demands strict compliance with the legislation on bears and wolves as protected species and a prevention of ""any mass culling.""The NGOs said a task force, funded by Slovenia and the European Commission, found that hunting is not a solution to decrease damage, and that a larger number of bears does not affect the number of damage events.According to the NGOs, hunters use intensive feeding to accustom bears to readily available food so they are easier to hunt. The feeding attracts the bears closer to human settlements and is one of the reasons for the high growth rate of bears in Slovenia. Instead of culling, bear populations would be better regulated by reducing the number of feeding sites, the NGOs said.This week, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said that the decision should be reviewed, calling on Minister for Environment and Spatial Planning UroÅ¡ BreÅ¾an – the minister in charge of the decision – to suspend it to allow the government to reconsider the issue. ""The minister explained to the prime minister the reasons for the decision. The decree the ministry issued on 13 April remains in place,"" the ministryâ€™s press release said.Last week, BreÅ¾an said that all other options to prevent conflicts had been examined, but neither relocation nor keeping bears in captivity were feasible due to the large numbers. (April 17 and 19)Officials claim that Bosnia and Herzegovina is not currently in a migrant crisisSarajevo (FENA) – The Service for Foreignersâ€™ Affairs recorded 1,543 illegal migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and, in the first two months of the year, almost three times as many illegal migrants than for the same period last year.Migration movements were also influenced by more favourable weather conditions. In addition, there was the possibility to access certain countries of the Western Balkans visa-free, from where migrants tried to illegally enter the territory of the European Union.Among the top five countries of origin of migrants were Afghanistan, Morocco, Cuba, Turkey and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with Afghan nationals accounting for almost half of all illegal migrants (47 percent). An average number of 855 migrants stayed in four temporary reception centres, which have a total capacity 4,880 of places.Minister of Security of BiH Nenad NeÅ¡iÄ‡ presented this information at the session of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of BiH and he stated that Bosnia and Herzegovina ""currently does not have a migrant crisis and that security in the country has not been compromised.""He also referred to the current issue of the construction of a temporary detention unit funded by the European Union and said that in the readmission process, not a single person who could threaten the security of BiH, citizens or property had been returned.""The facility has not yet been put into operation. The Service for Foreignersâ€™ Affairs did not take it over and no one lives in that building. Everything that is done, will be done in accordance with domestic legislation, regulations and legal norms,"" said Minister NeÅ¡iÄ‡. (April 19)EU Commissioner Gabriel opened new BioSens building in Novi Sad with Prime Minister BrnabiÄ‡Novi Sad (Tanjug) – The European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Marija Gabriel, visited Novi Sad, where together with the Prime Minister of Serbia, Ana BrnabiÄ‡, she opened the new building of the BioSens Institute.During the visit, the Commissioner, together with the Minister of Education Branko RuÅ¾iÄ‡ and the Director of UNICEF in Serbia, Dejana Kostadinova, visited the School for Primary and Secondary Education ""Milan PetroviÄ‡"". On that occasion, equipment for the integration of assistive learning technologies in the value of 20,000 euros was delivered, which will improve the inclusiveness of education in Serbia.Commissioner Gabriel, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Culture Maja GojkoviÄ‡, visited the Matica Srpska Gallery in order to learn about the achievements of Novi Sad as the European Capital of Culture in 2022 and the heritage of Serbian art in a wider European context.""You have definitely shown great things, as well as immense dedication. It was a successful year for all of you and we saw that you can show us a lot, both in terms of artists and the application of new technologies,â€ Gabriel said at the end of the visit to the Matica Srpska Gallery.Emphasising the importance of participating in EU programs, Gabriel pointed out that it was important to focus on innovation and new technologies, to encourage artists to create new ideas and to develop the creative industry at the same time. (April 19)Environmental organisations take legal action against green EU label for nuclear power and gasLuxembourg (dpa) – Several environmental organisations are taking legal action against the EU's classification of gas and nuclear power as climate-friendly. Greenpeace, Germany's Bund fÃ¼r Umwelt und Naturschutz (BUND) and the World Wild Fund (WWF), along with other groups, have filed lawsuits at the European Court of Justice against the so-called taxonomy, the associations said on Tuesday.The taxonomy is a kind of seal of approval for sustainable financial products used by the European Union to list areas in which investments can be made to mitigate climate change.""The European Commission must not dress up the problem as a solution. Nuclear and gas cannot be sustainable,"" said Greenpeace Germany Executive Director Nina Treu. Since the beginning of January, investments in gas or nuclear power plants have also been classified as climate-friendly. This has since caused debate and criticism, as burning gas emits climate-damaging CO2 and using nuclear power produces radioactive waste.Austria and Luxembourg are also suing against the EU taxonomy. Other EU states were also critical of the plan. France, which sees nuclear power as a key technology for a CO2-free economy and would like to continue exporting the technology to other countries, played a decisive role. In return, Germany advocated a green label for gas as a transitional technology.Now the EU court must decide whether the classification of nuclear power and gas as climate-friendly is justified. The oral hearing is awaited for next year. However, a ruling is not expected before 2025. (April 18)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"The European Gendarmerie Force is a ""secret army"" ? False","Established by several EU members in 2004 for the purpose of crisis management outside the European Union, the gendarmerie force EuroGendFor has been the subject of many rumours in recent years. A viral video that has been making the rounds on social media in French-speaking African countries since early April claims that the force enjoys total ""immunity"" and can operate ""in any country without having to ask for authorisation from the state involved"". These claims come against an African backdrop of distrust of Western countries like France, the continent's former colonial power. Yet, there is nothing secret about EuroGendFor, nor does it have immunity or the right to deploy without the consent of the host country, according to the treaty that established the force, as well as an expert interviewed by AFP. ""LISTEN UP,"" reads the caption to a eight-minute video shared on Facebook. The woman interviewed in the clip, who gives her name as Sylvie Charles, claims there is a gendarmerie force called EuroGendFor that was born out of ""NATO's secret armies"" and established by several European countries. The force enjoys total immunity, she claims without elaborating, and can ""operate in any country without having to ask for authorisation from the state involved"". She claims the force can be found today ""in Mali, Yemen. They operate outside of protocol and are found to have ties with terrorists.""Screenshot of a Facebook publication taken on April 12, 2023The video has been shared nearly 10,000 times on Facebook in Africa since April 8. Similar claims about EuroGendFor had already appeared in France in late March, showing up on TikTok and Facebook. On African social media, some Internet users claimed that the ""secret army"" would intervene in Mali and ""pose problems for the local population and leadership"".The rumour comes against a backdrop of tension between certain African countries and Western powers. ""The media (doesn't mention EuroGendFor) and the UN accuses Russia's Wagner group of illegally supporting the armed forces loyal to Mali, Burkina and the CAR,"" the internet users claim, referring to accusations made against the Russian paramilitary group by independent experts commissioned by the UN.For their part, the colonels in power in Bamako portray the Russian forces present on Malian soil as military ""instructors"". While legally speaking EuroGendFor is indeed a gendarmerie force, it is far from being a secret army whose members can deploy anywhere and have total immunity from prosecution.EuroGendFor explainedEuroGendFor was set up in 2004 by five members of the European Union -- France, which first proposed the idea, along with Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain -- according to the declaration of intent available on its website.  As mentioned in the Velsen treaty that established EuroGendFor in 2007 -- and as its name implies -- it is a force ""exclusively comprising elements of police forces with military status of the Parties, in order to perform all police tasks within the scope of crisis management operations."" Its headquarters are located in Vicenza, Italy. The High Level Interdepartmental Committee (CIMIN), ""made up of representatives of the appropriate ministries from every member of EuroGendFor, gives political-strategic direction to the force"" and the decisions are taken unanimously, wrote Franck Durand, a researcher specialising in security and defence law at the University of Reims, in an article for the European Union Review in 2018. Today, EuroGendFor is made up of forces from seven EU members: Spain's Civil Guard, the French National Gendarmerie, Italy's Carabinieri, the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, Portugal's National Republican Guard, the Romanian Gendarmerie and Poland's Military Gendarmerie. A special Lithuanian force -- the Public Security Service -- is a partner, while the Turkish Gendarmerie has observer status. It is worth noting that despite its name, the force is not an organ of the European Union and is ""dedicated to external crisis management,"" as mentioned on the French interior ministry website -- even if it was created in order to strengthen the bloc's Common Security and Defence Policy, the EU's main strategic instrument. ""When it comes to the various conflicts around the world, some crises are so severe that military interventions are necessary to reestablish order and the normal functioning of administrative structures. Armed forces are sent, and then the next phase is to restore social life, which is more of a mission for the police. The benefit of the European gendarmerie force is that it has this dual competence -- military and police -- which is what allows it to intervene at the pivotal moment when order and social life is being restored in a country,"" Durand told AFP on April 11. He added that EuroGendFor can set up ""expeditionary forces for special expeditions"". The gendarmes who take part do so voluntarily and receive special training. Deployments and types of engagementAccording to its website, EuroGendFor has deployed to eight countries since 2007, when it first did so to Bosnia and Herzegovina. Since then it has been notably deployed to a few  African countries including the Central African Republic (several missions since 2014), Libya (in 2016) and Mali (two missions since 2014).Screenshot of a map taken on the EuroGendFor website, on April 13, 2023 Durand said that to his knowledge, EuroGendFor is no longer present ""as a European force"" in Africa. Certain EuroGendFor gendarmes were, according to him, still present ""alongside French forces"" in Mali right up till the Barkhane withdrawal in August 2022. AFP reached out to EuroGendFor regarding its current deployments but had yet to hear back at the time of publication. Contrary to what the viral video claims, EuroGendFor cannot deploy to ""any country without having to ask for authorisation from the state involved"". Article 6 of the treaty signed by the founding members, states that the ""stationing and deployment on the territory of a third State shall be covered by an agreement between the Sending States and the third State specifying the conditions of such stationing and deployment, bearing in mind the fundamental principles of this Treaty"". ""If the states involved signed an agreement, then that means there was a discussion between them,"" said Isabelle Pingel, a member of the Sorbonne Research Institute for International and European Law (IREDIES). It is therefore not possible for EuroGendFor to deploy to a country without an invitation. Not to mention that ""international law forbids it,"" Pingel told AFP on April 12. ""Under no circumstances can EuroGendFor operate on a country's territory without its consent,"" said Durand, adding that EuroGendFor cannot ""intervene on its own initiative but must operate under the mandate of an international organisation requesting its deployment -- the UN, NATO or the EU"" or that of a coalition force. In Mali for example, EuroGendFor was deployed in 2014 under an EU mandate -- the European Union Capacity Building Mission in Mali (EUCAP Sahel Mali) -- to support the internal security forces. EuroGendFor's gendarmes were tasked with ""advising at a strategic level and training"", according to its website. In 2018, nine EuroGendFor experts in charge of mentoring and training Malian forces arrived in Mali, this time as part of the UN mission MINUSMA.As for the ""immunity"" supposedly enjoyed by members of EuroGendFor -- a legally vague claim interpreted by African internet users to refer to potential abuses committed in the countries of intervention, like the allegations against Wagner -- there is no mention of such a thing in the founding Treaty of Velsen. In fact, it appears that it might actually be ""the opposite,"" said Pingel. Article 25 of the treaty sets out the jurisdictional and disciplinary terms, providing many examples, including when the two sides -- the country sending the forces and the one receiving them -- have a concurrent right to exercise jurisdiction.""EuroGendFor is not entitled to any legal immunity regarding its operations,"" said Durand. ""At most it can negotiate -- as is the case for most civilian or military operations on foreign territory -- agreements determining attribution of jurisdiction in case of any crimes or misdemeanors committed by individual members of said forces,"" he added. Recurring rumoursEuroGendFor had already been hit by previous rumours that it was involved in various operations in Europe, including to put down demonstrations in Greece and France. Already in 2012, an article on a blog known for spreading misinformation claimed that EuroGendFor was ""ready to deploy in Greece, its first major operation against the population of a European state"". Greece was at the time in the throes of a government-debt crisis.""EuroGendFor resolves various problems for European governments,"" the author of the article claimed, adding that governments can ""use firearms against the people"" via the force's gendarmes. Meanwhile ""EuroGendFor cannot be prosecuted,"" the author added. There were similar claims in France during the yellow vest protests in 2018 as well as the demonstrations against the vaccine pass in 2022. Photos shared at the time -- and debunked by AFP -- included the claim that EuroGendFor was involved. Concerns over EuroGendFor -- their means of intervention and assumed ""immunity"" -- have also been the subject of questions submitted to the European Parliament over the years (in 2008 and 2011, for example), to which the institution responded by recalling the Velsen treaty provisions.Linked to a conspiracy theoristThe viral video that has been making the rounds on social media in Africa was taken from a longer interview of just over an hour that was posted to the YouTube channel Unis-Vers TV. In order to identify Sylvie Charles, who appears in the video without any mention of her job or title, AFP uploaded a screenshot from the video to PimEyes, a facial recognition search engine. AFP found that she had notably appeared in a video posted to the YouTube channel Morpheus in December 2021, in which she notably mentions legal problems and a court in Lille, France. A Google search of those keywords turns up a website with a letter that she claims to have sent to the Palais de Justice courthouse in Paris at the end of 2021.In this rambling 11-page letter, she notably accuses the French government of identity theft ""in criminal cases of financing terrorism, money laundering and embezzlement of public funds"" and claims that her father was assassinated in 2010 ""to protect the criminal activity"" of French authorities. She also brings up EuroGendFor, which she describes as ""an unconventional secret army,"" among a jumble of other topics. We also discovered that she had appeared in a livestream in April 2022 co-hosted by Hayssam Hoballah, whom the French daily Liberation had earlier identified as a conspiracy theorist.""This YouTuber could pass for an eccentric who claims to provide healing through raw food, massages, and Argentine tango,"" Liberation wrote at the time. ""But more than anything he's a conspiracy theorist who believes that the 'globalists' created Covid and that children are kidnapped by the powerful as sacrifices.""Marin Lefevre Tous ses articlesTranslated by Anna Maria JakubekFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: German foreign minister urges European unity,"German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock urges EU member states and their people to stand united. Police chiefs from 24 European capitals pull together to discuss organised- and cybercrime. Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and European Commissioner Thierry Breton agree on the importance of nuclear energy in the green transition.Baerbock: EU is freedom insurance for people and statesBerlin (dpa) – German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has called on the member states and inhabitants of the European Union to stand together. ""The EU is a community of states and people who want to be free together and who can only be strong and free together,"" she said at a meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares in Berlin on Friday. The EU still was a freedom insurance for people and states today, Baerbock explained.Baerbock praised the diversity and cultural autonomy of the member states. However, she warned that these must not undermine the fundamental rights of minorities, women or LGBTIQ persons. ""For it is these rights that make our European Union a community of freedom, including individual freedom,"" she said. The best protection for freedom, she added, was cohesion. ""It is not the Commission or the Court of Justice that threaten the sovereignty of the member states of the European Union, but a fragmented Union, in which everyone looks only to themselves or to their immediate neighbourhood,"" the German minister said.On the Russian war of aggression on Ukraine and Spain's upcoming EU Council presidency from 1 July, Baerbock said: ""Together, we will continue to stand by the Ukrainians in their defensive struggle against the Russian war of aggression for as long as necessary."" A real peace in Ukraine could only stem from freedom and not from submission, she said. ""We will stand alongside the people of Moldova and the Western Balkan states and make it clear to them that we are serious about the European perspective of their countries."" (April 21)Police representatives from 24 European capitals in Tirana for the security of the UnionTirana (ATA) – The 43rd European Capital Police Conference took place from April 18 to 21 in Albania. The main topic of the conference, bringing together the police chiefs from capitals across Europe, was the fight against cybercrime.During the conference, discussions and ideas were exchanged at a strategic level. Also, current issues were discussed and contributions were made to the cohesion, mutual understanding and cooperation of European police organizations.Common challenges and cooperation in the fight against organised crime – for example Joint Investigation Teams (JIT) – and ways to strengthen cooperation between police forces in this regard were discussed.The representatives of the police of European capitals also discussed cybercrime, including the challenges faced by the police and law enforcement agencies in the investigation and detection of these crimes. They also discussed ways to guarantee order and security of sports, public and cultural events, as well as strategies for facing contemporary challenges of order and public in Europe.On the last day of the conference, a joint declaration was presented and signed by the representatives of the police of the European capitals.Overall, this conference provided new opportunities for more efficient cooperation between police forces in European capitals. It also represents an important step for the Albanian State Police, as Albania makes an important contribution to the security of Europe, often by participating in the joint police operations. (April 21)Commissioner Breton in Slovenia on strengthening the defence industry and nuclear energyVipava (STA) – On Thursday, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob met European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton in the Slovenian town of Vipava. The meeting, which was also attended by the ministers of defence and economy, Marjan Å arec and MatjaÅ¾ Han, focused on strengthening the European defence industry and Slovenia's role therein, as well as the importance of nuclear energy for the green transition.Golob and Breton agreed that nuclear energy plays a significant role in the green transition. ""We share the view that nuclear energy is an integral part of the green transition solution, that we need to take big steps forward in the nuclear field,"" said Golob. Breton also stressed the importance of nuclear energy in the green transition, as it is energy without carbon dioxide emissions. He also stressed the importance of innovation in this field.In the context of the Russian aggression against Ukraine, the two leaders also spoke about strengthening the capabilities of the European defence industry. Golob presented Slovenia's role as one of the world's leading producers of high-tech equipment. Defence spending should be increased through support for high-tech companies in Slovenia, Golob said. (April 20)Spain's Interior Minister urged agreement on EU asylum reformVienna (APA) – During a visit to Vienna, Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska urged states to agree on the European Pact on Asylum and Migration. Before a meeting with Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner on Thursday, Grande-Marlaska said that it was imperative that the EU states reach an agreement before the European elections next year. Karner wanted to discuss Spain's experiences in its cooperation with Morocco with his counterpart.Spain takes over the EU Council Presidency on 1 July and wants to make the reform of the EU asylum system a top priority. ""The European Parliament already has a common position, so it is important that we also find an agreement at the level of the European Council,"" said the Spanish Interior Minister at a joint press event with Karner. He expressed confidence that there would be a convergence between the different positions of the EU states.While internal EU countries like Austria have been pushing for years for countries at the EU's external border like Italy or Spain to register incoming migrants more completely, the latter demand in return a fairer distribution of asylum seekers within Europe. However, Austria, among others, rejects this. So far, therefore, there is only the voluntary acceptance of a few migrants by some states – above all Germany – via the so-called solidarity mechanism.Grande-Marlaska advocated the protection of the Schengen area, which is free of border controls. For Spain, the Schengen area is ""a cornerstone of our community,"" he said. Spain has always been an advocate of the protection of the external borders. If it is not possible to protect the external border of the European Union, internal border controls should only be ""the last solution, which we should only resort to in an emergency,"" Grande-Marlaska stated.Karner praised the close cooperation between Austria and Spain in many areas. At the meeting, he was particularly interested in Spain's ""intensive"" experience of cooperation with Morocco in the field of migrant returns and readmissions. Austria, too, recently sought more cooperation in the field of migration during a visit to Morocco by Karner and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer.

"Jourová: ‘European Union to become a centre of media freedom’
","Ahead of World Press Freedom Day, the European Newsroom talked to European Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ about the Media Freedom Act, the anti-SLAPPs initiative and the general state of the media in Europe.The Vice-President of the European Commission for Values and Transparency, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, expressed her desire for the European Union to lead the fight for ""courageous"" journalists, who risk their lives to inform, as now in Ukraine or in countries with authoritarian regimes, and to become ""a centre of media freedom.""In an interview with the European Newsroom, ahead of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May, JourovÃ¡ also called for ""getting one's house in order"" on this issue, as the media were a pillar of the democratic system.JourovÃ¡ paid tribute to all journalists and media workers who ""risk their lives to inform us"", such as those ""who are now on the battlefield in Ukraine, who are on the front line under Russian bombs"", whom ""we desperately need there"" to know the facts.The Czech politician also said she was thinking of journalists ""working in authoritarian regimes, and those in prison.""In particular, she cited the American reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was arrested by Russia in March, and called for ""continuous pressure"" to be put on Moscow to release him ""because this is an outrageous attack on journalists and also on freedom of expression.""""I want the European Union to lead the fight to protect these courageous voices, and I want the European Union to become what I would call a centre of media freedom,"" VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ said.But in order to be that centre of freedom for the press, the EU had to have ""its own house in order,"" warned JourovÃ¡, who stressed the need to strengthen the independence of the press, protect the public media service and make information on the ownership of media companies public. There should also be transparency with regard to the money that authorities spend on institutional advertising and which media they choose to use for it.European Media Freedom ActLast September, the commission proposed the European Media Freedom Act (EMFA), a law to better protect independent media from state influence. It seeks to enshrine in law the principle of information as a public good, after the scandals of spying on journalists, doubts about the independence of public media or the opacity of government campaigns in the press.This future law ""is being criticised by many"", but ""we are doing the right thing by alerting member states to maintain strong and independent public service media without state or party tendencies, because this is exactly what we see in Poland and Hungary.""Referring to criticism of the planned law from German publishers, she said she had often explained to publishers what the proposal was about – and what it was not. For publishers, she said, it was hard to swallow that they were to be regulated at EU level for the first time.This was not about lowering standards, the Czech politician said. ""My message is that no system is absolutely immune."" For situations in which politics went mad in a country and new leaders had an appetite ""to capture the media landscape,"" she said, people would be glad to have a safety net in the EU. ""This can happen anywhere."" The planned European Board for Media Services would not have any influence on the content of reporting.The European Parliament and the EU member states are currently negotiating their respective positions on the proposed legislation. Member states could reach an agreement in the Council of the EU by the middle of the year. Parliament could follow suit in October. The two parties would then have to negotiate on a common position.This proposal, JourovÃ¡ explained, ""also means welcoming independent media who have to flee censorship in their home country"", which was why Brussels was trying to ""design effective help for Russian journalists living in exile in the EU"" so that they could ""continue to do their work.""Brussels considers that the situation has greatly deteriorated in several member states and argues that ""editorial freedom and the independence and strength of the media as important actors in the democratic system must be protected,"" JourovÃ¡ recalled.She considered it ""shameful"" that there were ""journalists who are being threatened, injured"" in the EU, which was why Brussels had made a recommendation more than a year ago to the member states to defend them and was going to ask for results ""at the end of this year.""Responding to a question about the police raid on the newspaper Domani on March 4 to seize an article regarding Claudio Durigon, undersecretary at the Italian Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and a member of the Lega party, JourovÃ¡ pointed out that the commission had ""tried to address this issue in the Media Freedom Act"" proposed last September. â€œWe propose to prohibit the member states or the politics interference into the life of media and into the editorial content."" JourovÃ¡ added that the commission ""cannot intervene, because it is an individual case in the field of law enforcement.""She stressed the need to act, especially in Eastern European countries that were EU members now, but in the past had belonged to the Soviet orbit, where ""strong media are needed to be able to counter the intense Russian propaganda"" that ""is bearing fruit because the ground is quite fertile."" VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ in an interview with 16 agencies from the European Newsroom in Brussels, Wednesday,  April 26, 2023. Photo: Benoit Doppagne/Belga Defamation and SLAPPsThe Czech lawyer, who was Justice Commissioner in the last parliamentary term, also stressed that she did not want ""abuse of the judicial system against journalists and freedom of expression"" in Europe.Brussels proposed the Anti-SLAPP Directive at the end of 2021, a regulation to strengthen the protection of journalists against abusive litigation, which was in the legislative process and ""it is not easy"" to carry forward, JourovÃ¡ acknowledged, although she hopes that it could be approved before the end of this legislature in mid-2024.Strategic lawsuits against public participation – commonly known as SLAPPs – are lawsuits filed against journalists, media outlets, and activists. They are regarded as a particular form of harassment against journalists, as the lawsuits typically drag on for years and hence require huge amounts of money and time from the defendant.""I am convinced that journalists must be able to do their work without fear,"" JourovÃ¡ stressed, also pointing to the importance of the fight against disinformation.""All that is crucial in times of elections, in times of war, but also in normal times, in any time democracy needs a strong media power. And that's why we are doing all these things that are unprecedented,"" she said.""There are exceptions related to the possible suspicion of crime or endangering national security: this,"" she admitted, ""will always be the justification we will hear from member states when these things happen, that there is a question of national security or some crime at stake."" According to the commission, alleged defamation is one of the most common reasons why SLAPPs are filed against journalists.According to the annual report by the Council of Europeâ€™s Platform for the Safety of Journalists, a coalition of fifteen press freedom NGOs and journalistsâ€™ associations, which was published on March 7, journalists and media outlets in Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Italy, Poland and Serbia are increasingly sued for defamation. The platform has registered several cases in which journalists have been fined over their reporting, among them, for instance, Mediapool.bg in Bulgaria. The fines ranged from EUR 1,000 to EUR 8,000. The day after the report was published, Lev Ins insurer has lodged an unprecedented half a million euro claim against Mediapool.bg.Disinformation on TwitterRegarding disinformation on Twitter, JourovÃ¡ said that before the Digital Services Act (DSA) would come into force ""there is still space for dialogue and I would really wish to explain to Mr. Musk our philosophy that we are protectors of freedom of speech, protectors of the freedom of expression. That's why we created such a complicated system, which is the Code of Practice [on Disinformation]â€, but ""freedom of speech in the EU is not unlimited.""In February, the commission published a report revealing how Twitter was lagging behind in the fight against disinformation, despite having voluntarily signed the Code of Practice on Disinformation. JourovÃ¡ added that once the DSA came into force â€œthis code will be considered as the tool which the platform might need to convince the enforcer that they are doing everything to mitigate the risk of disinformation.â€JourovÃ¡ reiterated disappointment in the social network's efforts to counteract the spread of fake news, and said she personally felt ""more and more uncomfortable on Twitter, in the neighbourhood of unregulated Russian aggressive propaganda.â€""I cannot predict what will happen to Twitter"" once the Digital Services Act came into effect, JourovÃ¡ continued, but ""I would compare the situation with driving on the highway: if you are overstepping the speed, you get penalties and one day you might be deprived of your driver's license. This is a general vision of how the DSA will be applied in the future in cases of noncompliance.""This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Germany prolongs presence in EU-led naval operation,"The German Bundestag extends the countryâ€™s participation in a naval operation led by the EU in the Mediterranean Sea. Belgium demands clarification from the European Commission on its European nature restoration law, while Spain asks the Commission for aid in light of the countryâ€™s drought crisis.Bundestag extends participation in EU naval operation IriniBerlin (dpa) – The German Bundestag has extended the participation of German soldiers in the EU-led naval operation Irini in the Mediterranean Sea for another year. The Bundeswehr – Germanyâ€™s federal armed forces – can thus continue the mission until 30 April 2024 and deploy a maximum of 300 soldiers. In a roll-call vote on Wednesday, 555 members of parliament voted in favour of the mandate. 101 parliamentarians were against the initiative and there was one abstention.The mission is designed to contribute to the implementation of the UN arms embargo against Libya, to consolidate the stabilisation of the country and to actively contribute to the peace process. It also aims to prevent the illegal export of petroleum, including crude oil and refined petroleum products, from Libya. In addition, intelligence is gathered to combat the business model of smuggling networks.The UN arms embargo against Libya was imposed in 2016, after a civil war had broken out in the oil-rich country following the overthrow of long-term strongman Muammar al-Gaddafi in 2011. To this day, numerous militias are vying for power and influence. Other states are also involved in the conflict, including Russia and Turkey. (April 26)Belgium asks for 'critical clarifications' on European nature restoration lawBrussels (Belga) – Belgium will submit a list of questions to the European Commission regarding the scope and implications of the European nature restoration law. This was announced by Flemish Environment Minister Zuhal Demir on Tuesday.The law, which is part of the European Green Deal, aims to counteract the deterioration of European nature. For instance, restoration measures should apply to at least 20 percent of land and sea areas by 2030. Against the backdrop of the struggle to reduce nitrogen emissions, the bill is causing concern about the potential impact on certain activities, especially in Flanders.After previous requests for adjustments from the Flemish government, Demir said there was now also a consensus at Belgian central government level to ask for ""critical clarifications"" from the Commission. These include the scope and implication of certain articles and possible compensation measures for areas subject to a deterioration ban.Belgium wants to form alliances with like-minded member states and will support other countries in asking for a legal opinion and cost-benefit analysis from the Commission. European environment ministers will consider the draft law in Luxembourg on 20 June. (April 25)Spain asks the European Commission to help its agriculture because of droughtMadrid (EFE) – On Tuesday, Spain asked the European Commission to advance ""the highest possible percentage"" of aid from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget in the face of the crisis in the countryside caused by an ongoing drought. Furthermore, the central government and the regional government of Andalusia continue to fight over the proposed law to regulate irrigation in the area surrounding the DoÃ±ana National Park.The Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas, explained that he has asked the European Commissioner for Agriculture, Janusz Wojciechowski, to bring forward this EU aid, which normally arrives in mid-October. Spain has also requested other measures, such as the activation of the CAP crisis reserve, the possibility of using unused amounts from the EAFRD fund to support farmers and the relaxation of conditionality in the payment of basic income and sustainability aid.This week, the lack of rainfall has led to a drop of 326 cubic hectometres (hmÂ³) in the water reserves of Spanish reservoirs, which at the moment hold just over 28,000 hmÂ³, at 50.1 percent of their total capacity. The situation is so grave that the national president of the agricultural association Asaja, Pedro Barato, has confirmed that 60 percent of dry cereal ""is lost"", that both grapes and olives are going through ""a difficult period"" and that ""unless it rains, some trees could be in danger."" (April 25)EU will increase its support to Ukraine, says Croatian parliament presidentPrague (HINA) – The European Union's support for Ukraine will increase, because it is becoming clear that the Russian invasion will not be stopped by politics and diplomacy alone, the President of the Croatian Parliament Gordan JandrokoviÄ‡ said in Prague on Tuesday.Ukraine did not have to fear a decrease in European aid in the fight against the Russian invasion, which has been going on for more than a year, JandrokoviÄ‡ said.""All member countries realise that, unfortunately, war cannot be stopped with politics and diplomacy alone. The Russian aggression cannot be stopped, so support for Ukraine will certainly be even stronger in the months and, if necessary, in the years ahead,"" he added.The conference of the presidents of the parliaments of the EU member states (EUSC) in Prague on Monday and Tuesday was marked by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and geopolitical circumstances. On the second day of the EUSC, the role of the EU in the global cooperation of democracies and the dependence of EU members on totalitarian regimes were discussed.The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said that ""in the future, we must not repeat the mistakes of the past"" such as energy dependence on Russia, and that it had been shown that the Union was ""effective when it is united.""JandrokoviÄ‡ also said that ""awareness that the European Union has been exposed and too dependent on non-democratic countries for a number of years is increasing. The availability of raw materials, technological materials and energy depended a lot on those who do not share the same values â€‹â€‹with us."" He added that the EU should turn to countries which were ""advocates of freedom, democracy, peace and protection of human rights."" (April 25)Bosnia and Herzegovina abstained from vote on Kosovo's admission to the Council of EuropeStrasbourg (FENA) – At the extraordinary session of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, Kosovo's request for membership in the Council of Europe was accepted. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina abstained, while the delegation of Serbia left the session. Political representatives of Serbia as well as Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s Republika Srpska entity both sent harsh criticism to BiH for not voting against Kosovo's request for membership.The ambassador of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Council of Europe, Ivan OrliÄ‡, said that the vote was made based on the instructions of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the divided opinion of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, adding that everything he did was in the interest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, including the entity Republika Srpska.For the President of Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, taking part in such a vote is unacceptable, because the decision on it should be made by the BiH Presidency with the consent of all of its three members.The President of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, said he was not surprised by the vote in the Council of Europe, because the candidate countries for membership in the European Union obeyed Brussels and Washington without question. VuÄiÄ‡ also claimed some of them did not even have their own foreign policy.Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008. Serbia, as well as five EU member states, has not recognized Kosovoâ€™s sovereignty to this day.Referring to the BiH vote, VuÄiÄ‡ said that ""if someone does not respect our territorial integrity, why should we respect theirs. Why should we protect someone's territorial integrity at any cost if they are against ours. These are not tectonic, but deep and essential changes in politics.""During the voting in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, 33 countries supported the proposal to start the procedure for Kosovo's permanent membership, seven of them were against (Azerbaijan, Cyprus, Georgia, Romania, Serbia, Spain and Hungary). Five of them abstained (BiH, Greece, Moldova, Slovakia and Ukraine), while Armenia did not vote at all. (April 24)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Video shows protester getting tackled, not 'assassination attempt' on Macron","Several Chinese-language social media posts claimed a video of a person getting tackled by the police showed the ""assassination of French President Emmanuel Macron"", in the Netherlands on April 12, 2023 during a visit to promote ties between the two key EU members.The video in fact shows police tackling a protester as he ran towards the French leader. A spokesman for the Amsterdam police told AFP two protesters were arrested for disturbing public order and making threats. On April 17, Macron gave a speech that was broadcast live and there have been no recent reports that he was the target of an assassination attempt.The nine-second clip was shared on Twitter on April 13, 2023, where it has been viewed more than 207,000 times.""French President Emmanuel Macron appears to have been assassinated during Amsterdam visit -- Reuters,"" reads the caption written in traditional Chinese characters.A screenshot, taken on April 18, 2023, of the misleading post.The claim circulated after Macron's two-day state visit to the Netherlands beginning on April 11 was twice targeted by protesters as he pushed through his flagship pension overhaul, which included raising the retirement age from 62 to 64 (archived link).The plan, which was signed into law on April 15, has triggered violent protests across France in the last three months (archived link).The video has also been shared alongside a similar false claim on Twitter, Facebook and Chinese microblogging site Weibo.But the claim is false. Reuters did not report that Macron was assassinated -- only that a protester running towards the French president was tackled to the ground by security officers (archived link).There have also been no recent reports about an attempt to kill the French president as of April 18, 2023.Protesters arrestedA Google reverse image search found the video was published in a Dutch-language tweet on April 12, 2023 about Macron's visit to the University of Amsterdam (archived link).The caption reads: ""Protester tackled during Macron's visit to the University of Amsterdam"".The video was also published by AFP and can be seen in the archives here.Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (left) and the Twitter video (right):A screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (left) and the Twitter video (right). AFP reported on April 12 that the protester ran towards Macron and was tackled to the ground, knocking over a man in uniform as the French president stepped out of a limousine with Dutch King Willem-Alexander and was being greeted by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema (archived link).""We arrested two protesters for running towards the president.

Regulating the unknown? EU ponders AI rulebook,"Chatbots, facial recognition and autonomous vehicles â€“ artificial intelligence (AI) offers countless possibilities. While supporters of this technology foresee rapid growth for innovation in Europe, critics fear unpredictable negative effects on society. EU lawmakers are trying to find a middle ground.Europe is moving to regulate artificial intelligence (AI), tighten security standards for chatbots such as ChatGPT, and impose a regulatory framework on developers and manufacturers who want to do business in the EU internal market – an ambitious challenge on the global market, where the United States and China simply let technological progress run wild. The European Commission proposed a new set of rules two years ago, the so-called Artificial Intelligence Act, which is currently being negotiated in Brussels and is set to be the first-ever legal framework on AI.On 28 April, the political groups in the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on the EUâ€™s AI rulebook, which mainly focuses on so-called â€œfoundation modelsâ€, primary knowledge building blocks that serve as the fundament for AI technologies. MEPs want these elements to be rigorously ""designed and developed in accordance with EU law and fundamental rights, including freedom of expression.""The text based on the informal agreement will now have to go to the European Parliament's Internal Market Committee for a vote on May 11. A plenary vote on the European Parliament's negotiating position is expected in June, followed by negotiations with the Council and the Commission.Endless possibilities versus unpredictable risksSabine Bendiek, Head of Human Resources at German software company SAP, said that AI could enormously improve productivity and be a support for people. For example, extremely monotonous, repetitive tasks could be taken over by AI. ""Our employees can then really focus on using what makes humans so strong: creativity and the ability to evaluate results with a different perspective and implement them accordingly.""But what about current and future developments based on algorithms and artificial intelligence? What about ChatGTP and autonomous cars? What about the risk that AI could be used to spread disinformation? Several MEPs recently called for a global summit on the dangers of artificial intelligence.Last month, German Digital Minister Volker Wissing called for the swift creation of a legal framework for AI in Europe. ""We must react wisely now and regulate artificial intelligence sensibly before it is too late for that. This must not take years again,"" Wissing told the German newspaper Bild am Sonntag. A spokeswoman for the German Interior Ministry told the daily Handelsblatt that â€œit is essential to strike a balance between openness to innovation and a clear legal framework that defines standards for trustworthy AI.""â€œArtificial intelligence regulation is at a very low level and its acceleration must be maximized,"" said Dobroslav Dimitrov, Chairman of the Bulgarian Association of Software Companies (BASSCOM) and Bulgarian Employers' Association of Innovative Technologies (BRAIT). In his opinion, the initiative is definitely overdue, which is why all decision makers at government, corporate or educational level should look into what is going on and adjust themselves on the move.Dimitrov compared AI with nuclear energy. ""It can set the whole planet in motion, but it can also destroy it if used for destructive purposes. The same applies to artificial intelligence,â€ he said.Italian Minister for Economic Development Adolfo Urso stated that it was necessary to develop new regulations to better define the relationship between man and machines, as machines seemed to have the advantage for the first time.ChatGPT under scrutiny, causes acceleration of AI legislationRecalling the case of AI chatbot ChatGPT, which Italy had temporarily banned in March and made available again at the end of April, Urso stressed that it ""showed the pitfalls of a sector that still needs strict regulation.â€ He added that the Italian data protection authorityâ€™s provisional restriction of ChatGPT â€œhas resulted in a higher level of protection for users.""Early last month, French Digital Minister Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot said that ChatGPT did not comply with the EU General Data Protection Directive (GDPR), but that it was better to ""frame"" it rather than ban it. In mid-April, the French National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) decided to open an investigation into five complaints against the chatbot.The European Data Protection Board (EDPB), which is the European level equivalent of the CNIL in the various member states and responsible for coordinating the authorities, announced the creation of a dedicated working group to promote European cooperation on the subject.Applying AI in the workforceUrso recently stated that the artificial intelligence sector in Italy, for example, had grown by 32 percent in one year to a value of 500 million euros. The sector â€œis now central to the development programs of companies of all sizes that invest in intelligent data processing, language AI and computer vision,â€ he said.In the general business landscape in Spain, artificial intelligence is used in 8 percent of companies with more than 10 employees. According to data for 2021 published by the EU statistics office Eurostat, this figure corresponds to the European average. Production processes, marketing and sales strategies, cybersecurity and the organisation of management processes are the main applications of AI in Spanish companies, according to a 2022 study by the Spanish multinational financial service company Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA).The Croatian Association for Artificial Intelligence (CroAI) gathers leading companies and startups in the field of artificial intelligence in Croatia. According to data from that association, more than 130 startups in Croatia were developing and looking for the application of artificial intelligence as of the end of 2022. While three years ago, 220 companies were applying AI, that number had grown to around 440 by October 2022, CroAI said.Europe as a global player in AIBulgarian Interim Minister for Economy and Innovation Alexander Pulev recently noted that Bulgaria could become a regional hub for the flow of digital information from Asia. Furthermore, he said that Bulgaria and the US government had signed a declaration aimed at improving the quality of Bulgaria's digital infrastructure with a focus on cyber security.The President of the Foundation ""Society of Common Values"" in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Zlatko LagumdÅ¾ija, pointed out the importance of integrating the digital transformation of the EU, which should not be limited to EU member states, but should include neighbouring countries like those of the Western Balkans on the same principles and projects.Speaking at a conference in Cambridge, LagumdÅ¾ija noted that only in this way could the EU demonstrate that it had the capacity to lead these processes on a global level, together with, for example, the United States and Japan.The EU was already deeply into the process of creating an online regulatory framework, and must go back to the drawing board now to figure out how to effectively regulate AI.The battle over an outright ban on the use of artificial intelligence facial recognition technologies without the consent of those involved, where the EU Council could push through an exception related to national security clauses, is expected to be particularly bitter.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Austrian Chancellor Nehammer advocates for diversity and against centralism in the EU,"With Europe Day around the corner, Austrian Chancellor Nehammer speaks out in favour of diversity and the EU Commission Representation in Slovenia aims to minimise waste production during the festivities, following the signing of a zero waste commitment with an NGO. In other news: Serbia and Kosovo agree to move forward in resolving cases of missing persons and EU anti-corruption measures may become stricter in the future.Vienna (APA) – On Thursday, Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has spoken out in favour of diversity and against centralism in the European Union. The European founding fathers were aware â€œthat Europe means diversity,â€ said Nehammer at the ceremony â€œEurope – Together for Democracy, Peace and Sovereigntyâ€ in Parliament in Vienna on the occasion of Europe Day next Tuesday.According to Nehammer, every state has a particular history. â€œWeâ€™ll never fit together in a template-like system like the United States.â€ It was important to look at diversity within the EU and to be considerate, the chancellor from the conservative Peopleâ€™s Party (Ã–VP) said, describing himself as an â€œardent European.â€At the same time, Nehammer stated that he was also a â€œpassionate fighterâ€ for subsidiarity and diversity rather than centralism. This needed to be emphasised, Nehammer added. â€œIn doing so, I am giving Europe a chanceâ€ to grow. According to Nehammer, the struggle for consensus was difficult in the EU. However, this was â€œthe added value of democracy and diversity.â€ The chancellor also spoke out against replacing this quest for consensus with more majority decisions in the EU Council.Nehammer: â€œEurope is actually good. It is much more than a word, than a contract.â€ The European Union was proof that people could actually learn from history. (May 4)EU wants a â€œblack listâ€ sanctioning corruption in the worldBrussels (AFP) – The European Union announced on Wednesday that it wanted to harmonise anti-corruption criminal provisions across the bloc and add perpetrators of acts of corruption, wherever they were committed in the world, to the â€œblack listâ€ of European sanctions.â€œCorruption can threaten international peace and security, fuel organised crime, terrorism, and other crimes. That is why we are expanding our scope of action to fight corruption around the world,â€ said the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell.Under the legislative framework proposed by the European Commission, which still has to be approved by the 27 Member States, people considered to be involved in â€œserious corrupt activitiesâ€, regardless of their nationality, could have their assets frozen in the EU, be banned from staying on European soil and be deprived of access to financial resources based in Europe. (May 3)European Commission and NGO Ecologists without Borders sign zero waste commitmentLjubljana (STA) – The Head of the European Commission Representation in Slovenia, Jerneja Jug JerÅ¡e, and the president of the environmental NGO Ecologists Without Borders, Katja SreÅ¡, signed a zero waste commitment ahead of Europe Day on 9 May. By doing so, they committed themselves to ensure that as little waste as possible will be generated in the country during the events of this yearâ€™s European Day.The events will be marked by green transformation, sustainable practices and the European Year of Skills. The central ceremony will be held in Ljubljana and will be opened by Slovenian President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar and European Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ. (May 3)Serbia and Kosovo agree to move forward in resolving missing persons casesBrussels (EFE) – The President of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, and the Prime Minister of Kosovo, Albin Kurti, approved a joint statement to advance the resolution of cases of missing persons on Tuesday. The statement was made in a meeting within the framework of the dialogue sponsored by the European Union (EU) to normalise their relations.â€œBoth parties have recognized the humanitarian nature of the issue of missing persons and have pointed out the urgent need for additional joint efforts to alleviate the situation of affected families and the community in general,â€ said the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, who organised the meeting together with the European mediator in the dialogue, Miroslav Lajcak.The agenda of Tuesdayâ€™s meeting in Brussels included the search for people still missing after the 1998/1999 war between Serbian forces and the Albanian-Kosovar separatist guerrilla. Also on the agenda was the creation of the association of municipalities with a Serbian majority in Kosovo, one of the major obstacles in the dialogue.

Photo falsely claims to show police convoy escorting Ukrainian grain through Poland,"The photo of the convoy was shared on social media in April 2023 with the claim that it showed police escorting Ukrainian grain through the Polish village of Korczowa, located by the border with Ukraine. This information is false. An AFP investigation revealed that the photo was in fact taken in 2011 in the Polish city of Lodz and has nothing to do with the transit of Ukrainian grain through Poland. Over the past few months, the issue of Ukrainian grain has upset Polish farmers. It has also led to tension between Poland and the European Union. Ukraine began exporting grain by land through the EU after its traditional Black Sea routes were disrupted by Russia's invasion in February 2022. But local farmers complained that some of the grain was piling up in Poland and driving down domestic prices.In order to protect its farmers, Poland's government on April 15 introduced a ban on grain imports from Ukraine. On April 18, the two countries reached an agreement on the transit of Ukrainian agricultural products through Poland under the condition that none of the grain would remain in Poland. On the following day, a photo appeared on social media that claimed to show Ukrainian grain exports under the escort of Polish police near the Ukrainian border. ""Korczowa: the first trucks full of moldy grain from Ukraine crossed the Polish border this morning. Since then the transport has been under the escort of police cars and helicopters. More than 200 Polish officers -- including 40 from the anti-terrorist division -- are taking part in the operation,"" reads a tweet with the photo, which was published on April 19, 2023. The same photo also appeared on Facebook with a similar caption (here and here).We searched for the photo on the internet and found that it was first published more than a decade ago and was taken in downtown Lodz, a Polish city more than 370 kilometres away from Korczowa. Screenshot taken by AFP on April 28, 2023, Different time and placeOne of the first things to raise our doubts was the size of the vehicles in the photo. Grain is usually transported in much larger trucks (with a capacity of over 20 tonnes) than those seen in the photo. Typical grain trucks can be seen for example on AFP photos taken last month at the Ukrainian-Polish border crossing of Hrebenne-Rawa Ruska.To find the original photo, we did a reverse image search. It showed that an identical image was published in February 2011 on the news site Lodz.naszemiasto.pl, which provides information on Lodz and surrounding areas. The photo was also published that same day by another news site, expressilustrowany.pl. Both had the same caption: ""A convoy of dangerous criminals"". The articles quoted Grzegorz Wawryszuk from the press office of the provincial police headquarters in Lodz, who spoke of ""prisoner transport vehicles under the escort of cop cars with sirens on"". Thanks to details from the article, including that the vehicles ""turned left onto Mickiewicz alley from Kosciuszko alley"", we were able to easily locate where the photo had been taken. It turns out that it was not an image from Korczowa but had in fact been taken in Lodz, Poland's fourth largest city. As you can see in the juxtaposition below, the same building appears in both the photo shared online (on the left) as well as in a Google Maps screenshot of an intersection in Lodz. The photo from the Facebook  post (left) and a screenshot taken on Google Maps show the same intersection in Lodz. The same building is seen on both images. Korczowa is a village with only a few hundred people. Its tallest building is a small church. No multi-storey building like the one in the photo can be found anywhere in the village on Google Maps. Poor quality of grain?In addition to farmer dissatisfaction over the influx of Ukrainian grain, concerns over its quality also appeared on social media. There were many unsubstantiated claims, including that the grain was ""infested with worms"" or ""moldy"". Food safety concerns also arose from the fact that because Ukraine is not a member of the European Union, it does not have to abide by EU guidelines regarding pesticides and toxins in grain and cereal products. Social media claims from the beginning of 2023 that so-called ""technical grains"" -- which are intended for industrial purposes -- from Ukraine were being used for human consumption led the Polish government to release a statement calling the information ""fake news"". The government assured the public that ""all grain imported into Poland is subject to border control by the relevant services.""Transit allowed but imports bannedPoland's government on April 15 introduced a total ban on imports of grain and other products from Ukraine in order to protect its own farmers. Fellow EU members Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia took similar measures. A few days later, Warsaw and Kyiv arrived at an agreement to resume the transit of grain and other Ukrainian agricultural products through Poland while banning imports. Soon after, on April 21, Ukrainian grain transports hit the road again. The deal was agreed on the condition that none of the product would end up on the Polish market. In order to ensure the security of the transit through Poland, vehicles carrying the product must be secured with electronic seals equipped with GPS trackers and monitored by officers from the KAS national tax administration. The first transport secured by the KAS left the customs department in the border village of Medyka that same day.  The ban on imports of agricultural products like grain, sugar, eggs and other food items from Ukraine will be in force until June 30, 2023. Kyiv has lodged an official protest regarding the issue of grain. Poland and the EU received diplomatic notes on the matter. Maja CzarneckaAll articlesAFP PolskaAll articles Translated byAnna Maria Jakubek Facebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: German Interior ministers demand heightened border security,"Interior ministers of the German federal states of Brandenburg and Saxony call for border checks with Poland and the Czech Republic. The Spanish Presidency of the EU Council will prioritise legislation of artificial intelligence during its term. Several EU member states wish to move away from unanimity in the foreign policy decision-making process.Interior ministers call for controls at borders with Poland and the Czech RepublicDresden/Potsdam (dpa) – The interior ministers of the German federal states of Brandenburg and Saxony are calling for the introduction of stationary controls at the borders with Poland and the Czech Republic in order to limit the unauthorised entry of refugees. Two Christian Democrats, Michael StÃ¼bgen and Armin Schuster, raised the demand in a letter to German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser ahead of a refugee summit planned for Wednesday. They referred to the border controls already in place in Bavaria, which they said were effective and correct.On Wednesday, the German federal states will meet with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin to discuss the further financing of refugee costs.According to the press release, Saxony's Interior Minister Schuster said that ""against the background of the comparable migration situation at the borders of Brandenburg with Poland as well as Saxony with Poland and the Czech Republic, we have jointly written to the Federal Minister of the Interior, asking for the temporary reintroduction of stationary internal border controls.""His counterpart StÃ¼bgen said that ""if we want to maintain freedom of movement in the Schengen area, we must prevent a loss of control at the German federal border. We therefore expect the federal government to immediately introduce stationary internal border controls and intensify its border protection measures."" He added that the mood of the population was increasingly threatening to tip.Germany has been controlling the border with Austria in Bavaria since the autumn of 2015, after tens of thousands of refugees and other migrants made their way from Greece to Western Europe via the Balkan route. (7 May)Spain will prioritise AI regulation during its EU presidencyFlorence/Brussels (EFE) – The Spanish Vice-President and Minister of Economic Affairs and Digital Transformation, Nadia CalviÃ±o, said that during the upcoming Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the regulation of artificial intelligence would be prioritised, given its rapid development in recent years. CalviÃ±o announced this during her speech at the ""State of the Union"" forum, held in the Italian city of Florence.â€œAs with all industrial revolutions, digitalisation is a lever for growth and prosperity, but it also brings about profound changes in the way we work, interact, inform ourselves and live. And in the functioning of our democracies as well,â€ CalviÃ±o said. According to her, the European Union is already ""at the forefront of efforts to develop a regulatory framework for artificial intelligence (AI)"", which has sparked intense debate with the emergence of such advanced tools as ChatGPT.The European Parliament expects to seal the ""final agreement"" on a proposed regulation on AI this month, with the aim of having the law ready by ""the end of the year or early next year"", although it has not yet set out its position on the future of ChatGPT. (May 4)Belgium and eight other states want to get rid of unanimity rule in European foreign policyBerlin (Belga) – On Thursday, Belgium and eight other European Union member states launched an initiative to phase out the unanimity rule in defence and foreign policy. By doing so, they want to ""improve the effectiveness and speed of our decision-making,"" a joint statement said.Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Luxembourg, Finland and Slovenia united on Thursday in a ""Group of Friends"", pushing for more European foreign and security policy decisions to be taken by a qualified majority. That would no longer require all 27 but at least 15 member states to agree, provided they represent at least 65 per cent of the EUâ€™s population.Most decisions in the EU are taken by a qualified majority, but giving up the veto on foreign policy or security is a delicate debate that has been going on for years in European circles. Opponents, often smaller countries, fear they will be sidelined more quickly this way and will have less weight in decision-making.The advocates, in turn, argue that the war in Ukraine and the geopolitical high tension in general refocus their arguments. ""In the context of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and growing international challenges, the members of the group are convinced that European foreign policy needs adapted processes and procedures to strengthen the EU as a player in international politics,"" they said.The nine member states stress that they want to work closely with the European institutions and other member states and that their group is open to new members. They also assure that they want to improve decision-making ""in a pragmatic way"", focusing on ""concrete practical steps"" and based on the current European treaties. Amending these treaties would require unanimity. (May 4)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

Europe Day: EU-nifying visions in challenging times,"In light of Europe Day, celebrated on May 9, EU member states â€“ and those with accession ambitions â€“ reflected on the blocâ€™s achievements and future plans for the union. The day promoting peace and unity across the continent coincides with Russia, among other countries, celebrating the victory over Nazi Germany in 1945. The war in Ukraine, trade and business disputes with China and the United States, inflation – the EU is confronted with challenges on many sides. Leaders of the European Union marked Europe Day and discussed current topics on the blocâ€™s agenda.While on Tuesday Germanyâ€™s Chancellor Olaf Scholz called for more global cooperation on equal terms instead of striving to turn the European Union into a third ""world power"" alongside the US and China, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen showed solidarity with Ukraine in Kiev.European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ spoke in Slovenia about the EUâ€™s achievements regarding the single market, the Schengen zone, the Euro and the Erasmus programme, but stated that EU pioneer Robert Schumanâ€™s vision has not been realised yet. ""Europe has not reached peace,"" the commissioner said.The 9th of May turned Europe Day in UkraineEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen sang Kiev's counter-song to Russia's Victory Day when she visited the Ukrainian capital on the occasion of Ukraineâ€™s first-ever celebration of Europe Day. ""It is here that the values we hold dear are defended every day,"" the European Commission President emphasised. But it was not only ideas and principles that were discussed between von der Leyen and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.Standing alongside the European Commission president, Zelensky urged the EU to speed up ammunition deliveries, lift ""unacceptable"" restrictions on Ukrainian grain exports and begin talks on Ukraine's EU accession. ""The time has come to remove the artificial political uncertainty in the relations between Ukraine and the EU,"" Zelensky told journalists during a joint press conference.After the talks in Kiev, von der Leyen made it clear that she thinks Ukraine is deeply serious about pursuing its EU ambitions. ""I come out from this visit more impressed than ever by the determination of the Ukrainians, despite the huge challenges they face. We must continue to support them,"" she told an AFP journalist acting as a pool reporter for the European Newsroom.Von der Leyen is set to brief EU member state leaders next month and hand them a report in October on Ukraine's progress in democratic and anti-corruption reform. At that point, the members will have to decide whether to launch formal EU accession talks.There is much good will for Ukraine in EU capitals, but also scepticism whether a country with such a troubled recent history will be in shape to begin formal accession talks this year. Brussels estimates that once they begin, the talks could take six to 10 years, while Kiev is more optimistic.EU27+: Promises, unity and fair enlargement?""We said to the countries of the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova: you belong to us, we want you to become members of the European Union,"" said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz during his speech in the European Parliament on May 9. He added that this was not about altruism, ""but about credibility and economic interest"", as well as the effort to ensure peace in Europe, especially after the turning point represented by Russia's attack on Ukraine.Scholz added that a fair enlargement policy meant fulfilling the promises that had been given to all the countries of the Western Balkans, which were promised the European perspective 20 years ago. ""A geopolitical Europe must keep its promises to its neighbours,"" he said.https://twitter.com/Bundeskanzler/status/1655904983722721281Spain, who takes over the rotating presidency of the EU on 1 July, marked Europe Day with events across the country. The Spanish government aims to strengthen the EUâ€™s relations with Latin America as, according to Spanish diplomats, Europe needs to open up to ""reliable partners"" in order to guarantee supply chains at a delicate time for the EU in geostrategic terms.Stabilisation in the Balkans and countering both Russian and Chinese influenceEuropean Union leaders had already vowed to strengthen ties with the Western Balkans, a drive reinvigorated by Russia's war on Ukraine, during an EU-Western Balkans Summit in December 2022. The war has underlined the importance for the EU to bring the Balkans into its orbit, to stabilise the region and counter the influence of both Russia and China.Spanish diplomacy has also made rapprochement with the Western Balkans one of its priorities, as the countryâ€™s Foreign Affairs Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares outlined during a tour of Serbia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania and North Macedonia last month. Slovenian President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar also stated that she believed in more Europe and was promoting it in the Western Balkans, as she believed this would bring more stability to the region.Meanwhile, the celebrations of May 9 showed that the two entities of Bosnia and Herzegovina have a vastly different outlook on the countryâ€™s future with regard to politics and the pending EU membership: While the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina celebrated Europe Day with numerous cultural events, the Republika Srpska celebrated the day as Victory over Fascism Day – like Russia.The president of the Institute for Democracy Societas Civilis Skopje, Marko Troshanovski, and Andreja Stojkovski, Executive Director of the North-Macedonian independent think tank PRESPA Institute, have a more critical outlook on the current enlargement process. ""Despite the urgency of the moment with the war in Ukraine, which was expected to speed up the process a year ago, there have been no substantial shifts in terms of the enlargement. The EU does not have a comprehensive vision for the enlargement, and there is neither interest among the member states in the process nor in defining any deadlines for a new enlargement,â€ they told the North-Macedonian Media Information Agency (MIA) on May 9.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Commissioner Gabriel nominated as Bulgarian PM,"European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has been nominated to become Bulgariaâ€™s next prime minister. MEP Marc Tarabella issues a statement after being released from prison in the course of the Qatargate corruption investigations. The European Court of Justice revokes the Commissionâ€™s approval of state aid for German airline Lufthansa.Commissioner Gabriel nominated as Prime Minister of BulgariaSofia/Brussels (BTA) – European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel has been nominated as Bulgaria's prime minister by the countryâ€™s GERB-UDF coalition, which won the country's fifth snap election in two years.The European Commission announced that Gabriel is going on unpaid leave and during this time her work will be taken over by Commission Vice-Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Margaritis Schinas.Manfred Weber, chairman of the EPP group in the European Parliament, expressed his full support for Gabriel and said that the GERB-UDF put the interests of the country first.In the coming days, Gabriel is expected to continue her meetings with the political forces represented in the Bulgarian parliament to explore the possibilities of support for a government under her leadership. President Rumen Radev announced that he would hand over the mandate to form a government on 15 May.The first thing Bulgariaâ€™s justice minister in Gabriel's government would need to do is to submit a request to the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) to dismiss (Prosecutor General) Ivan Geshev for undermining the prestige of the judiciary, Gabriel said after her nomination. Geshev's resignation was among the reasons for the protests in Bulgaria three years ago, followed by several snap elections.Gabriel set out 10 goals on which she would work: a plan to get out of the political crisis and establish a functioning government, the normalisation of the work of the institutions, a stabilisation of public finances and adoption of a new budget, a reform of the judiciary, the adoption of basic laws, the implementation of a mechanism for investigating the Prosecutor General and the Criminal Procedure Code, reforms in the Anti-Corruption Commission and the promotion of Bulgaria's accession to the eurozone and the Schengen area.Gabriel also spoke about tackling inflation and price increases, guaranteeing the country's energy security, overcoming the backlog of operational programmes, improving the security of Bulgarian citizens, tackling domestic crime, improving road safety, tackling migration and renewing the armed forces. She also stressed the need to move towards a digital and green economy. Things should not even stop there, but go as far as constitutional reform, Gabriel said. (May 10-11)Qatargate: Tarabella wants to resume activities as MEPLiÃ¨ge (Belga) – Less than 24 hours after his release by the responsible judge in an investigation into corruption in the European Parliament, Marc Tarabella has issued a statement for the first time since Qatargate broke out. The MEP and mayor of Anthisnes, LiÃ¨ge, hopes to resume his duties. He spoke very emotionally and said his incarceration was the toughest period of his life.Tarabella had been detained for his involvement in an investigation into corruption within the European Parliament. On Tuesday, the investigating judge ruled that his arrest was no longer required, and detention with an ankle bracelet was ended.Tarabella gave a press conference at the office of his lawyer, Maxim TÃ¶ller, a few hours after his release. He still has to comply with some conditions. For instance, he is not allowed to leave Belgium. Tarabella spoke at the press conference about how he experienced everything: the accusation, the investigation, his stay in the cell and the ankle bracelet at home.Tarabella claims to have been framed by lies from Antonio Panzeri, a man he considered a friend for a long time. Tarabella appeared before journalists with tears in his eyes. ""The only reason I am named in this case is because of a statement by a man who wanted to save his own skin,"" he said.Tarabella said he continues to cooperate with the investigation and hopes the case will end in an acquittal or the dropping of charges against him. He hopes to resume his activities as an MEP and also wants to resume his post as mayor of Anthisnes. (May 10)EU should not have approved Lufthansa aidLuxembourg (dpa) – The European Commission should not have approved the billions in state aid for German airline Lufthansa during the Covid-19 pandemic, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said. The Commission had made â€œclear errors of assessment"", judges announced in Luxembourg on Wednesday. The court thus upheld the complaint of competitors Ryanair and Condor.Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Belgium had promised the Lufthansa Group a total of nine billion euros in aid, but this amount was not retrieved in full. The major part of the sum came from Germany. Six billion euros were contributed by the federally owned Economic Stabilisation Fund (in German: WSF) in exchange for a 20 percent share package and silent participation, while the German state-owned KfW Bank contributed a loan of one billion euros. The six billion euros from WSF were the subject of the legal dispute between the European Commission, Ryanair and Condor.Lufthansa has repaid the aid, and WSF disposed of its last Lufthansa share package in September 2022, realising a bottom-line profit of around 760 million euros. The silent partnerships and loans, including from Switzerland, had already been reattributed and repaid beforehand and were partly replaced by capital market bonds. Lufthansa returned to profit in the 2022 financial year and was also able to repay the last state aid from Belgium and Austria, seats of its subsidiaries Brussels and Austrian Airlines, at the end of 2022.The ECJ revoked the Commission's approval. The competition watchdogs should have examined more closely whether Lufthansa still had its own collateral to obtain loans for itself. In addition, the court criticised that Lufthansa's market power at the airports had been underestimated. Furthermore, the Commission should have ensured that Lufthansa did not have more market power than before after the aid package, and that effective competition remained in place.The Commission announced that it would carefully examine the ruling and consider possible further steps. It could appeal against the ECJâ€™s ruling. (10 May)MEP Wiener calls for healthy breakfast for all childrenBrussels/Strasbourg (APA) – The gap between children who come to school with breakfast and those who come without is widening, according to Austrian Green MEP Sarah Wiener. MEPs adopted a report on the so-called EU School Scheme in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The aim is to give even more children access to the programme and thus to a healthy breakfast in the new programme period starting in 2024, Wiener told journalists online.According to a British study, pupils achieve good grades twice as often after a good breakfast compared to children with an empty stomach, Wiener said. However, it is not just about ""food intake, but about quality"" as well. The EUâ€™s initiative for fruit, vegetables, milk and dairy products has been running since 2017 and aims to promote healthy eating for children up to secondary level. According to Wiener, around 15.9 million children across Europe benefited from the EU-funded breakfast in 2020/21, half a million of them in Austria.The European Commission has proposed a revision, as some criticism of the programme, which expires in 2023, has been raised. For example, over-sweetened drinks such as cocoa and too few regional products were promoted. The bureaucracy is also to be streamlined in the new period starting in 2024, so that more small and regional producers can benefit.The funds from Brussels, currently around 250 million euros per year, are to be increased. Wiener says it has not yet been decided by how much.In any case, ten percent of the money should flow into educational measures such as cooking workshops or farm visits. Because fewer and fewer children know what they are actually eating and what the consequences are. At least 25 percent of the food distributed should be organic: ""It is important to me that we offer a lot of unprocessed products without additives,"" Wiener said.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky shows appreciation for Germanyâ€™s help in the course of Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine.Slovenia hosts diplomatic conference to adopt MLA ConventionLjubljana (STA) – Slovenia is hosting a diplomatic conference from 15 to 26 May to adopt the Convention on International Cooperation in the Investigation and Prosecution of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity, War Crimes and Other International Crimes (MLA Convention). The convention, which will fill legal gaps in the investigation and prosecution of the most serious international crimes and be the first international treaty to be named after Ljubljana, is expected to be adopted at the conference.It will be the largest diplomatic conference ever hosted by Slovenia. It brings together some 250 experts in the field of international public and criminal law from 79 countries that support the initiative for the MLA. Slovenia is leading the initiative for the convention, together with the Netherlands, Belgium, Argentina, Mongolia and Senegal.At the opening of the conference, the participants were addressed by, among others, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon and Minister of Justice Dominika Å varc Pipan, Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, Dutch Minister of Justice Dilan YesilgÃ¶z-Zegerius and International Criminal Court (ICC) Judge Kimberly Prost.If approved at the conference, the MLA Convention will be the first major treaty on international criminal law adopted since the Rome Statute in 1998. The Netherlands will be the depositary of the convention, which will also be named after the Slovenian capital. (May 15)Zelensky thanks Germany – Scholz reluctant on fighter jetsBerlin/Aachen (dpa) – Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has thanked Germany for its help in the defensive struggle against the Russian attack.On his first visit to Berlin since the invasion, he also asked for support in the delivery of modern fighter jets. Ukraine was working in European capitals to ""create a fighter jet coalition"", Zelensky said on Sunday at a meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz at the Chancellery in Berlin. He also asked Germany to support Ukraine in this coalition. Russia dominated the airspace. This should be changed.Scholz, cautious about this, said that Germany had supplied Ukraine with a great deal already. ""Especially in terms of air defence, we provided very modern and effective weapons such as the Patriot system and the Iris-T."" Germany, he said, was focusing on supporting the defence campaign. After the United States, Germany was the second largest supporter of Ukraine, he added. ""We will continue to do so."" Again, Scholz assured, ""we will support you as long as it will be necessary.""Charlemagne Prize for Zelensky in AachenIn Aachen, Zelensky and the Ukrainian people were later awarded the Charlemagne Prize for their services to the unity of Europe. In his laudation, Scholz said that the award ceremony was a prelude to further coalescence in Europe. In addition to Ukraine, he also mentioned the countries of the Western Balkans, Moldova and, in perspective, Georgia. Scholz assured Zelensky, ""Ukraine has our full support on its way into the European Union."" Ukraine was ""part of our European family,"" he said. (May 14)French PM says there is ""no pause at all"" in Franceâ€™s climate ambitionSaint-Paul (Reunion Island, France) – French Prime Minister Ã‰lisabeth Borne said that there was ""no pause at all in the climate ambition"" of France, after controversial statements were made by Emmanuel Macron, calling for a halt in the formulation of new environmental standards in Europe.Macron called for ""a European regulatory pause"" on environmental standards, saying the European Union had done ""more than all its neighbours"" and was now ""in need of stability.""These comments have aroused the anger of environmental leaders and activists in France and raised questions in Brussels.Referring to the ""Green Deal"", during a visit to Saint-Paul on the French island of RÃ©union, Borne said that ""this legislation is ambitious, it allows us to meet our objectives. Now we have to work on implementing it and this is already a very important task,"" she added, asserting that it was not useful to ""add standards to standards.â€ (May 13)Connecting the capital cities of the Western Balkans by railSarajevo (FENA) – Director of the Belgrade-based Transport Community (TC), Matej ZakonjÅ¡ek, said that the main task of the Transport Community was to return the railway to where it belonged, and that is why they are working on establishing passenger connections between the main cities of the Balkans.The Transport Community is an international organisation founded in 2017 with the aim of developing the transport network between the European Union and the countries of Southeast Europe. Members of the TC are the European Union and six countries of the Western Balkans, namely Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro and Serbia.""Currently, we have only one connection between Belgrade and Bar, and our goal is to establish a connection between Sarajevo and Zagreb, as well as between Sarajevo and PloÄe, and for it to function as a standard offer,"" ZakonjÅ¡ek emphasised.He says there is money for improving the quality of the transport service, because the European Commission has defined it in the investment plan. As for the price of each of the projects, it depends on the standard that is to be achieved in terms of, for example, electrification, speed, and so on.The Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and Transport of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Igor PejiÄ‡, said this should help decision makers to determine solutions in the direction of integration into the European railway system. Therefore, it was necessary to monitor the trends in which Bosnia and Herzegovina was lagging behind.The European Community adopted rules on railways 30 years ago and the transport policy is one of the common policies of the European Union, considering that transport knows no borders.

Clash on EU spending rules,"The EU's debt rules are to be reformed to give member countries more fiscal leeway to modernise their economies. While some believe this will boost investments and kickstart growth, others, with Germany at the forefront, fear that a loose fiscal policy will only increase the deficits and debts of highly indebted member states.The recent crises prompted even frugal countries like Germany or the Netherlands to take on large amounts of public debt, leading to calls for reform. The bloc's strict debt and deficit rules, known as the Stability and Growth Pact, have been temporarily suspended because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and this suspension was extended due to the sky-high energy prices, a fallout of Russia's war against Ukraine.The previous rules are set to apply again from 2024. However, the European Commission proposed granting highly indebted European countries more flexibility in reducing debts and deficits.""We simultaneously ensure both equal treatment and consideration of country-specific situations,"" the EU Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni told a news conference at the end of April.According to the EUâ€™s current spending rules, the public deficits of member states must not exceed 3 percent of their gross domestic product, and debt should stay below 60 percent of GDP. Under these rules, states must pay back 5 percent per annum of the debt exceeding the 60 percent mark. For highly indebted countries, this is devastating for growth. The rules date back to the 1990s and were often disregarded even before the pandemic. They were also to be reformed before then.The current reform proposal retains the previous goal of limiting debt, but there will be more flexibility through country-specific plans for debt reduction. Positions on the debt rules and the new proposals are very different in the individual EU states. The ""frugal"" northern countries, including Germany, want the rules to remain strict, while southern states like Italy say they constrain their ability to invest. EU member states' debts have rocketed in the past 15 years. The EU aims to conclude an agreement by the end of this year.Berlin calls for binding targetsGermany, a staunch defender of fiscal discipline, fears the reform will overly relax the European Union's budgetary constraints and undermine fairness within the bloc.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner hit out at the changes. ""Germany cannot accept proposals that amount to a weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact,"" he said, adding ""significant adjustments"" were needed.Lindner's objections resembled a ""recipe of the past,"" a European Commission official said.Referring to the reform on the EU fiscal rules, Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis argued that ""we live in a very different world than 30 years ago. Different challenges, different priorities.â€ The new rules would have to reflect these changes, he added.France and Germany disagreeThe commission also appeared to try to satisfy Germany with a proposal that says member states must reduce their deficit by 0.5 percent per year if it exceeds 3 percent of GDP.But France was not happy with the change. The countryâ€™s debt stands at around 110 percent of GDP.""Certain points go against the spirit of the reform ... We are against uniform automatic rules for reducing the deficit and debt,"" French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at the end of April. The compromises proposed by the commission still provide for a ""general escape clause"" in the case of a severe economic crisis.Majority welcome country-specific approachBelgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem said he very much welcomed the proposal, especially the country-specific approach laid down in the rules. He said reducing debt while focusing on investments and reforms was essential. The current Belgian government wants to get back in line and reduce deficit to 2.9 percent by 2026. It aims to cut deficit by 0.8 percent a year between 2024 and 2026.Dutch Finance Minister Sigrid Kaag said her country was ""quite enamoured"" by the plans, but stressed the importance of ""credible debt reduction"" and oversight. ""The devil is always in the details,"" she added.Spanish Finance Minister Nadia CalviÃ±o, who will oversee negotiations in the second half of the year, said she would do ""everything possible"" to approve the new fiscal rules this year. Spain will take over the EU Presidency in the second half of 2023 and welcomes the country-specific approach in the commission's proposal. Meanwhile, Brussels and Madrid disagree on Spain's deficit forecasts. The Spanish government has calculated that it will reduce its deficit to 3 percent in 2024, as required by EU fiscal rules that will be applied again next year. The commission, however, has estimated that Spain's public deficit will increase to 3.3 percent in 2024.From Rome, Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti hailed the commission's legislative reform proposal as ""a step forward"" that would make it possible not to go back to the old Pact. Giorgetti, however, did not hide his disappointment at the failure of the so-called â€œgolden ruleâ€, which would have allowed to deduct strategic investments from the accounts. ""We had strongly demanded the exclusion of investment expenditure, including those typical of the Digital and Green Deal NRP (National Recovery Plan), from the calculation of target expenditure against which compliance with the parameters is measured. We note that this is not the case."" On the basis of some technical simulations circulated in Brussels, the adjustment of the Italian accounts could lead to a reduction of the structural deficit by 0.85 percent per year in the case of a 4-year plan and by an average of 0.45 percent in a 7-year plan. At the same time, Italy is the only country that did not ratify the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) and aims to link the ratification to the outcome of negotiations on the Stability and Growth Pact. ""If you start linking everything with everything, it becomes more difficult to make progress,"" warned Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis.Romanian Minister of Finance Adrian CÃ¢ciu argued that the package should strike a balance between â€œsustainability (sound public finances) and inclusive and sustainable economic growth (needs for reforms and investment).â€ He added that the new framework should create sufficient conditions to stimulate investment in member states with economic difficulties or a precarious fiscal space.Today, Italy's debt stands at 144,4 percent of GDP, while Belgium is expected to have a debt burden of 106 percent by the end of this year – well above the bloc's limits.Slovenia and Croatia: Methodology tougher on smaller states?Slovenia, on the other hand, fears that it is hard to come up with a common methodology to measure debt levels, due to the huge differences between member states. ""When it comes to this, the commission's base proposal is not particularly to our liking,"" Finance Minister Klemen BoÅ¡tjanÄiÄ said in Brussels on May 16. However, the country welcomed the proposalâ€™s approach to focus on monitoring debt developments rather than structural deficits, mainly because the latter were very difficult to calculate and the results could also vary a lot, depending on the methodology, the minister said. Sloveniaâ€™s main concern is that, regarding the methodology, the commission could be tougher on small member states.Croatian Finance Minister Marko Primorac said his country was satisfied with the current rules and supports the new proposal aimed at boosting public debt sustainability and giving member states greater autonomy in running their fiscal policies, but it finds the proposed model of sustainability analysis unacceptable as it would put Croatia among high-risk countries. ""We find the current system absolutely acceptable as well. We are not in breach of the existing rules, but we fully support any improvement to increase transparency and simplicity in applying the methodology,"" Primorac said on Tuesday in Brussels after the meeting of EU finance ministers. According to Primorac the debt sustainability analysis is ""a very complex model based on a series of assumptions which, when incorporated into the model, categorise Croatia as a high-risk state when it comes to the amount of public debt. Given our fiscal situation, this classification does not apply to us."" He pointed out that there was no reason to classify Croatia as a high-risk country when it came to public debt sustainability given the countryâ€™s very good fiscal results.Bulgaria works to join eurozoneBulgaria still hopes to join the eurozone by 2025 and to stay below the 3 percent deficit threshold. In 2022, Bulgaria's debt amounted to 22.9 percent of GDP, according to preliminary data published by the National Statistical Institute in late April. Nikolay Vassilev, former deputy prime minister, said that there would have to be measures regarding the expenditure side of the draft budget to achieve a lower deficit. The fiscal reserve as of March 31 amounted to the equivalent of over 6 billion euros.ECB and IMFChristine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank, speaks during an informal meeting between EU finance ministers and central bank governors.

Lagarde also pointed to the ""differences and disagreements between countries because they face different challenges.""Next steps The EU could reform the pact by the end of the year.

Video falsely claims to show Russia moving nuclear weapons to EU border,"Soon after Finland joined the NATO defence alliance in April 2023, a video appeared online with the claim that it showed Russian ballistic missiles being moved through a town near the Finnish border -- which is also the EU's eastern frontier, as Finland is a member. Our investigation uncovered that the clip was in fact filmed in a town nearly 1,000 kilometres away from the border with Finland. Other videos online showed that equipment belonging to the Russian strategic forces regularly pass through the town en route to military parades in Moscow.Finland officially became NATO's 31st member on April 4, 2023. The decision was taken in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Kremlin branded Finland's accession an ""assault"" on Russia's security and said it would take countermeasures.A couple of days later, a video appeared on social media with the claim that it showed four RS-24 Yars ballistic missiles being transported through the Russian city Vyborg -- around 40 kilometres from the border with Finland. ""After Finland's accession to NATO... strategic nuclear equipment and missiles are heading to Vyborg near the border with Finland,"" reads a tweet from April 7, 2023. But the footage was not taken in Vyborg. Instead, it was shot nearly 1,000 kilometres away in a city near Moscow.Screenshot on Telegram of a Polish post taken on April 19, 2023. Similar posts were shared on Facebook, TikTok, Reddit and Telegram and also appeared in French, German, Polish and Spanish. Video's locationTwitter users quickly tracked down where the clip was taken and tweeted their findings, for example here and here. They found that the video had been filmed in the Russian town of Kolchugino, located northeast of Moscow. It is an 11-hour drive from Vyborg.Screenshot taken on Google Maps on April 19, 2023, showing the road from Vyborg to KolchuginoOne online sleuth posted the exact location of the video: 56.309722Â°, 39.378333Â°. When we inputted the geolocation into Google Maps and switched to Google Street View, we spotted the same residential building and street as shown in the footage on social media. The clip features military vehicles against the backdrop of a building with green balconies. Nearby there is a supermarket painted red and white. Both buildings are also visible on Google Street View. Below is a side-by-side comparison of screenshots from the video and Google Street View. They both feature a residential building, traffic lights and a red-and-white supermarket.  A screenshot comparison of the video in the social media post and  Google Street View, on April 19, 2023A YouTube search of keywords like Kolchugino in Russian turned up similar footage from the same location posted a few years prior. For example, this clip from eight years ago, shows the same residential building with green balconies and military vehicles transporting large missiles in the company of police. ""Return of equipment from the parade in Moscow through Kolchugino 13.05.15,"" reads the description of the clip. Similar Yandex searches pointed us to another video, posted to Russian social media platform VKontakte in 2014. It shows the same building and traffic lights, but from a different angle, as it was taken on Mira street in Kolchugino. Other leadsAnother clue to the video's true location is the licence plate of the car parked in front of the residential building. As seen in the clip, the licence plate number is A 434 TY 33.  Screenshot of the video on social media, which shows the number plate of a car, on April 20, 2023We were able to decipher the number thanks to a blog called Russia Beyond, where we read that ""the Russian registration plate consists of several parts. First comes a registration code and series that includes a unique combination of numbers and letters. It always looks like a letter - three numbers - and another two letters"". After the registration code and series there is a square separated by a line, the Russian flag and the abbreviation ""RUS"". The number in the square refers to the region where the vehicle was registered. According to information on the blog as well as in this article, the number 33 refers to Vladimir Oblast near Moscow, which includes Kolchugino. Our online searches also indicated that this type of military vehicle often passes through Kolchugino in connection with the May 9 Victory Day parade in Moscow. When we did a Yandex search for the Russian for ""missiles Kolchugino"", it turned up an article from 2020, which noted that military vehicles were spotted in Kolchugino en route to the parade on Moscow's Red Square. While we were able to establish where the video was taken, we did not manage to find out when it was shot. Other sites that also looked into the footage -- such as Snopes and Euronews -- were also unable to establish when the video was filmed.Intercontinental ballistic missile Google searches of screenshots from the footage took us to the website of the Missile Threat project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, which features photos of RS-24 Yars missiles. The site features basic facts about the missile, including that it is 22.5 metres long and two metres in diameter. It is able to carry a nuclear warhead and has a range of 10,500 kilometres. Russian Yars RS-24 intercontinental ballistic missile systems move through Red Square in Moscow, during the Victory Daymilitary parade, on May 9, 2021 (Photo AFP / Dimitar Dilkoff)According to the website of the Russian Nuclear Forces project, which provides information about the country's nuclear weapons, the RS-24 Yars was acquired by the Russia's strategic rocket forces in 2010. The Russian defence ministry announced on March 29, 2023 that its strategic rocket forces -- responsible for the country's strategic nuclear arsenal -- had begun drills with Yars mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles. The exercises were being conducted in various regions of Siberia, according to Russian television.Natalia SawkaWszystkie wpisyAFP PolskaWszystkie wpisyTranslation : Anna Maria JakubekFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Albania hosts joint NATO military exercise in Tirana,"Tirana hosts the largest European military event, led by the US European Command, with 29 countries participating in the joint exercise. A group of ten EU member states advocates qualified majority rather than unanimity in foreign policy decision-making. The European Commission and Parliament condemn the vandalism of its offices in the Bulgarian capital Sofia.Albania organises joint exercise with NATO's allied armiesTirana (ATA) - Albania hosts the largest military exercise in Europe for the second time, with 29 NATO members and partner countries participating. The military exercise ""Defender Europe 2023"" started on Monday, with a special ceremony taking place on Mother Teresa Square in Tirana, where military equipment were exhibited. Albanian President Bajram Begaj, Prime Minister Edi Rama, US Ambassador Yuri Kim, Defence Minister Niko Peleshi and generals of the US army were present at this ceremony.Â ""Defender Europe 2023"" is led by the US European Command, demonstrates the inter-operational capabilities of the US with allied and NATO partner armed forces until June 3 and will extend to 10 different European countries. As part of the exercise, some 7,000 pieces of equipment have been sent from the US to Europe, while a further 13,000 pieces of equipment are being pre-positioned from stocks.In the framework of this comprehensive training commitment, from May 15 to June 9, 2023, Albania hosts and conducts the ""Immediate Response"" and ""Astral Knight"" exercises. (May 22)EU foreign ministers discuss the use of qualified majority voting in foreign policyBrussels (STA) – The first meeting of the informal Group of Friends on Qualified Majority Voting in EU Foreign and Security Policy, which also includes Slovenia, took place on the margins of Mondayâ€™s EU Foreign Ministers Meeting. The group advocates qualified majority rather than unanimity in foreign policy decisions. The EU's foreign policy spokesman, Josep Borrell, supported qualified majority decision-making.""I am pleased that various member states have joined the group at our initiative, Romania being the latest to do so,"" said German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. The informal group also includes Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and Slovenia.Baerbock stressed that they were not proposing a revolution, but an assessment of what could be done within the existing EU treaties to make the Union's foreign and security policy more effective. The existing treaties, under so-called ""Passerelle clauses"", allow for a shift from unanimity to qualified majority decision-making in certain areas, including sanctions. (May 22)Outrage in Brussels and Sofia over vandalism of EU buildingSofia (BTA) – The House of Europe, a building that houses the European Parliament and European Commission offices in Sofia, was smeared with red paint by supporters of the Revival Party, the third largest force in Bulgariaâ€™s parliament, the National Assembly. The party's chairman Kostadin Kostadinov said the vandalism during the â€œMarch for peaceâ€ eventÂ was ""another step on the road leading to the country's liberation from foreign dependencies and ties.â€ The Bulgarian Interior Ministry opened an investigation and is looking for the perpetrators.In a position, the European Commission said that the right to peaceful protest was a fundamental value in any democratic society, but any acts of violence or vandalism against the buildings of European institutions were unacceptable.â€œThe building housing the European Parliament Liaison Office in Sofia was targeted by vandals unhappy with our stance in support of Ukraine. We will clean it up,â€ the President of the European Parliament Roberta Metsola said on Twitter. â€œOur backing of Ukraine will get stronger. Our voice condemning Russia's invasion will only get louder,â€ she added.The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry has strongly condemned the attack on the House of Europe. â€œSuch acts are irreconcilable with modern Bulgaria and the democratic values that our country embodies,"" the statement said. Acting Bulgarian Foreign Minister Ivan Kondov added that such events do not help in protecting countryâ€™s interests in the EU.Although it is the third-strongest political force after Bulgaria's fifth snap election in the last two years, the Revival Party was not invited to the talks to form the next regular government. (May 21-22)EU welcomes G7's unwavering support for UkraineHiroshima, Japan (EFE) – European Council President Charles Michel welcomed the commitment of the G7 leaders' summit in Hiroshima, Japan, to support Ukraine ""as much and as long as necessary.""In a video recorded at the end of the summit after two days of meetings, which he shared on his personal Twitter account, Michel stressed that the representatives of the EU institutions ""have worked hard to defend European values and interests"" during this meeting. He attended together with the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen.Russia's aggression against Ukraine, new rounds of sanctions against the Kremlin and support for Ukraine's integrity and sovereignty were three of the key elements on the agenda of a summit in which Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky participated in person. All the emerging powers present at the Hiroshima summit, including India and Brazil, ""support the principle of sovereignty"" and say the conflict ""must end peacefully"", Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida told a press conference.Another key point of the G7 was the announcement of sanctions against Russia, an initiative led by the US, Canada and the UK, which aims to punish the hundreds of individuals and companies that are helping the Kremlin to circumvent the sanctions that the West has imposed since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022. Meanwhile, the EU said it is preparing a new sanctions package that will include restrictions on Russian diamond exports, one of the Kremlin's main sources of funding, which three members of the G7 (the US, Canada and the UK) have already sanctioned to some extent. (May 19, 20 and 21)Croatian information verification model relevant for the EUZagreb (HINA) – The representative office of the European Commission in Croatia evaluated the Croatian model of establishing a system for checking the accuracy of information in the public space and a network of fact-checkers relevant for every EU country, noting that it was the only such project financed by the Next Generation EU instrument.As part of the project to verify the accuracy of information, there were public calls to which associations as well as scientific and educational institutions interested in verifying facts and evaluators of applications could respond. The latter were required for the part of the project for which almost 4 million non-refundable euros were allocated. The calls closed at the beginning of May.Deputy head of the Croatian European Commission Representation and head of the media department, Andrea ÄŒoviÄ‡ VidoviÄ‡, said that the European Commission welcomed this initiative of the Ministry of Culture and Media and the Agency for Electronic Media (AEM).""As far as we know, it is the only thematic project in the European Union that is financed from the National Recovery and Resilience Plan, i. e. the Next Generation EU instrument,â€ ÄŒoviÄ‡ VidoviÄ‡ told HINA. â€œThe goals of the project are in line with what the European Commission insists on when we talk about media and social media and they are certainly relevant for every member state,"" she added.The idea is to strengthen the capacities and competences of existing information checkers through the project, establish new independent fact-checkers, but also a system and procedure of fact-checking in media newsrooms, in order to make the media resistant to misinformation.

"“Hope doesn’t constitute good preparedness”: Interview with EU-Commissioner Janez Lenarčič 
","2022 marked the hottest European Summer on record and the next forest fire season is upon us: Ahead of the 10-year-anniversary of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC), the European Newsroom (enr) organised an interview with European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ on May 25.There does not seem to be a shortage of crises within the EU and beyond - from the Russian invasion of Ukraine to floods in Italy, droughts in Spain and forest fires in Northern and Southern Europe. In an interview with the European Newsroom, EU Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ emphasised that not only response but prevention and preparedness are on the agenda of the ERCC. â€œWe expect a busy, busy summer – this year has already started much drier than average,â€ the Slovenian politician explained to correspondents from 17 agencies participating in the enr, most of whom were present for the interview in person and online. While LenarÄiÄ said that in 2023 no country had asked for forest fire assistance yet, the fire-fighting capacities at EU level had been increased in preparation for the upcoming forest fire season from 13 aircraft in 2022: â€œWe will have ten medium amphibious aeroplanes, 14 light amphibious aeroplanes and four medium and heavy helicopters,â€ the commissioner explained. The  water caption capacity of the fleet had roughly doubled, he added. Over the past two decades, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism had been â€œactivated on average 20 times per year, meaning once or twice per month,â€ LenarÄiÄ explained. However, there had been a steep increase: Since the beginning of the current Commissionâ€™s mandate in 2019, the mechanism had been activated â€œmore than 100 times each year,â€ with an average of â€œone to two [activations] each week.â€Here is a selection of images from the interview including a tour of the control room where staff works around the clock:Based on the interview, the enr produced a joint Key Story which you can find here.

Less is more in foreign policy: unanimity hanging by a thread?,"A group of ten EU member states launched a fresh drive to reform the bloc's approach to decision-making on foreign and security policy after years of infighting over the issue. While the reform would favour France and Germany, the EU's two most populous nations, previous attempts to change the system have proved divisive.At the beginning of May, a so-called Group of Friends, led by Germany and also including Belgium, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Spain issued an appeal to overhaul voting on the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). Romania joined the group this week.Instead of unanimity on key foreign and security policy questions, the group called for a system called qualified majority voting. Such voting requires 15 of the 27 countries being in agreement – as long as they represent more than 65 percent of the EU's total population of roughly 450 million.""The goal is to improve effectiveness and speed of our foreign-policy decision-making. Against the backdrop of Russiaâ€™s war of aggression against Ukraine and the growing international challenges the EU is facing, the members of the Group are convinced that EU foreign policy needs adapted processes and procedures in order to strengthen the EU as a foreign policy actor,"" the Group of Friends stated in a document.In opposition, however, a coalition of countries has formed in favour of maintaining unanimity. According to reports, it includes, among others, Poland and Hungary.Changing geopolitical situation calls for more speedGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock stressed that the group was not proposing a revolution, but an assessment of what could be done within the existing EU treaties to make the Unionâ€™s foreign and security policy more effective. The existing treaties, under the so-called â€œpasserelle clausesâ€, allow for a shift from unanimity to qualified majority decision-making in certain areas, including sanctions.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz considers changes to the voting procedures of the European Union inevitable. It should not be possible for one individual member state to stop everything, Scholz told German media.In a speech in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Scholz also spoke about reform needs within the European Union, including changes necessary to admit more countries to the now 27-strong union. More decisions would have to be taken by majority rather than unanimity vote, he stated. Meanwhile, insisting on democratic principles and the rule of law was ""indispensable,"" he added.The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez spoke along the same lines during the institutional celebration of Europe Day on 9 May.  ""We have to opt decisively for qualified majority voting and, therefore, we have to be consistent. If we are moving towards an EU of more than 30 countries, we will have to change the way we decide the policies we implement,"" SÃ¡nchez said.On board, but treading carefullyFor now, Slovenia is part of the Group of Friends ""to keep an eye on what is going on,"" Slovenian Foreign Ministry State Secretary Samuel Å½bogar said on Monday. ""As a small country, we want to state what our problems might be and make it clear that we need certain assurances that our interests will be taken into consideration,"" he added.''A more efficient decision-making process, through the use of qualified majority voting, would give the EU the ability to act quickly and have an impact,â€ said Romanian Foreign Minister Bogdan Aurescu. He too brought to mind that, at the same time, it remained important for Romania to ensure the necessary mechanisms to protect and safeguard national interests.Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation Antonio Tajani personally is â€œin favour of qualified majority voting (in foreign policy, ed.), but this is not the time to deal with this issue,â€ he said. â€œIf anything,â€ he added, the issue could be taken up again â€œafter the end of the Ukrainian crisis and after we have concluded the enlargement to the Balkans.""When it comes to Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Secretary General of the European Movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Haris Plakalo, believes that changing the voting rules will not affect this country as much, because Bosnia and Herzegovina received the status of a candidate country for EU membership in December of last year, although it did not fulfil the set priorities. ""We do not need to be worried, nor can we, when it comes to changing the approach to decision-making on foreign policy in the EU Council, because the expansion of the EU to the Western Balkans is defined and determined by many documents, strategies and outlined as one of the important tasks of the EU,"" he added.Preserving the vetoThe Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Zbigniew Rau told Polish media that â€œthere is a strong tendency on the part of the German neighbours (...) that those matters which, according to the current state of the law, are subject to unanimous voting, such as tax issues and, most importantly for us, those concerning security and foreign policy, should be decided by a majority vote. We, as Poland, cannot agree to that,"" he said.Bulgaria is so far upholding the unanimity rule, acting Foreign Minister Ivan Kondov noted. He stated that in his opinion this should not be changed, but added that the next government in Sofia should take it from there.  Bulgaria is expected to have a new rotating government soon, co-chaired by former European Commissioner Mariya Gabriel.Sofia has used its veto once since joining the EU in 2007, in relation to the start of enlargement negotiations with North Macedonia last year. Sofia and Skopje have differences, with Bulgaria and the EU insisting that, in order to open the first negotiating chapters, North Macedonia's constitution be amended to include the local Bulgarian minority as one of the minorities in the former Yugoslav republic.Nemanja TodoroviÄ‡ Å tiplija of European Western Balkans, an independent think tank based in Belgrade that focuses on the Western Balkan countries, said that the debate about unanimity â€œhas been going on for years, but there is no sign that it will be resolved in the near future. It is true that it is related to the topic of enlargement (...), but its greater importance is for the situations we are currently witnessing – Hungary's opposition to certain decisions in the domain of the Common Foreign and Security Policy.â€Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs PÃ©ter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ expressed ""concern about the debate on qualified majority voting in EU foreign policy, noting the importance of maintaining the unanimity requirement to protect national interests."" At a press conference, SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ reported that there was a meeting at ambassador level for those member states who wanted to keep the possibility to defend their own interest in the decision-making process in Brussels.When asked if Croatia participated in this meeting, Croatian Minister of Foreign and European Affairs Gordan GrliÄ‡ Radman said that he was not aware of this initiative.GrliÄ‡ Radman said that Croatia did not support the proposal to replace decision-making by consensus with a qualified majority voting in some areas of the EU's foreign policy, as unanimity was the only mechanism that guaranteed the equality of smaller states. However, he emphasised, â€œthat does not mean that Croatia is not in favour of EU unity. On the contrary, until now we have never blocked any decision and we have always been a constructive collaborator.""Strength in diversity?Karl Nehammer, Chancellor of Austria. Photo: Virginia Mayo/AP/dpaAustria's Chancellor Karl Nehammer said he was against centralism and for diversity in the EU, and thus against more EU majority decisions. The struggle for consensus was difficult in the EU, he said, but this ensured democracy and diversity.The Austrian Foreign Ministry also expressed scepticism about the proposal, saying that qualified majority voting was not a panacea. ""Only political will is the key to success, the struggle for compromise is the essence of the EU. And once agreements are reached, they are supported by all. That is a special value, especially in volatile times like now.""In the past, however, top Austrian politicians had spoken out in favour of majority decisions.The Group of Friends said it aimed to coordinate with EU institutions and work closely with all member states, inviting other countries to join its reform drive. Should a simple majority of EU countries – 14 out of 27 member states – vote to launch a process to reform the EU treaties, negotiations could begin.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: German defence minister slams Hungary over Ukraine aid blockade,"German Defence Minister â€œsomewhat disappointedâ€ with Hungary over Ukraine aid. More than 1,000 individuals indicted over war crimes in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In other news: Belgian Prime Minister eager to halt European nature legislation and ECB wants to bring inflation back to 2 percent. Pistorius criticises Hungary for blocking more aid to UkraineBrussels (dpa) – German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius has severely criticised the Hungarian government for blocking further aid to Ukraine. He was ""somewhat disappointed or irritated by the behaviour of our Hungarian friends"", he said before a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels on Tuesday. The background is that Hungary's largest bank OTP is on a Ukrainian list of supporters of the Russian war of aggression. A Hungarian government spokesman said on Monday that Hungary would refuse new military aid as long as OTP was not removed from the list.Pistorius stressed that he failed to comprehend the reasons put forward by Hungary. Regarding Budapest's actions, he said, ""This is not a fine move."" In concrete terms, Hungary is currently blocking an increase of the so-called European Peace Facility (EPF). This is a financial instrument through which the EU already supplies weapons and equipment and supports the training of the Ukrainian armed forces. Because of the bankâ€™s listing, Hungary also does not want to agree to another EU sanctions package against Russia at the moment. The main aim of this package is to render circumventing EU sanctions more difficult.The National Agency for the Prevention of Corruption (NACP) of Ukraine had put the OTP bank on its list of war sponsors at the beginning of May. The agency justified this by saying that the Russian branch of OTP had continued to be one of the leading banks on the Russian financial services market even after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. By continuing the financial operations of the Russian entity, the OTP Group was clearly showing support for terrorism, NACP said. (May 23)BiH Prosecutorâ€™s Office indicts more than 1,000 individuals for war crimesLjubljana (FENA) – At an EU conference in Ljubljana, dedicated to the fight against genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, the Chief of the Prosecutor's Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milanko KajganiÄ‡, presented the work the Special Department for War Crimes had achieved in almost two decades of its existence.Among other things, it was pointed out that the department brought indictments for serious violations of international human rights law against more than 1,000 accused individuals. On the basis of these indictments, more than 320 defendants had been sentenced so far. More than 3,450 years of prison sentences had been handed down. Testimonies of more than 13,000 witnesses had been heard in the courtrooms, proving the responsibility of the accused for war crimes in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.The eighth EU Day Against Impunity was organized by the Council of Europe, the European Commission, Eurojust and the EU Network for the Investigation and Prosecution of Genocide, Crimes against Humanity and War Crimes, with the participation of the European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders. (May 23)Belgian Prime Minister De Croo wants to push pause button on European nature legislationBrussels (Belga) – Following the example of Flemish Minister for Environment and Energy Zuhal Demir, Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo also advocates pressing the ""pause button"" regarding the European Nature Restoration Act. ""At some point you have to make a choice. Is now the time to do everything at the same time?"" the Prime Minister said on Flemish television on Tuesday.De Croo stressed the importance of ""not overloading the cart"" by tightening the standards on nitrogen, nature restoration and biodiversity in addition to the targets on CO2 emissions. Indeed, he said, that would have two consequences: Firstly, that the industry would no longer be able to keep up and therefore CO2 reduction targets would not be met, and secondly, that we would then risk losing momentum on mitigating climate change.""And so I ask you to press the pause button,"" De Croo said. ""Don't overload the cart with issues that strictly speaking have nothing to do with global warming. The other issues are also important, but we need to phase them better over time.""In a press release, Demir reacted ""surprised"" to De Croo's announcement. ""The Belgian federal government's change of heart is a good thing, but insufficient,"" the press release said. ""If De Croo really wants to present himself as a great leader, he'd best join French President Emmanuel Macron and myself in pleading for a reality check of the entire European climate policy.""Sammy Mahdi, President of the Flemish Christian-Democratic party, is pleased with De Croo's statements. ""Back in early May, we and the European People's Party (EPP) in the European Parliament sent a signal to the European Commission that we simply reject the European Nature Restoration Act as it is currently on the table. We do not support a proposal that would mean the end of farming for many of our Flemish farmers,"" Mahdi said. ""The European Commission's plans are good for those who believe in fables of outgrowth, but disastrous for those who care about the welfare of 6.5 million Flemish people,"" he added.The Green party describes De Croo's statements as ""scandalous"" and ""not covered by the government"". ""European agreements are not a scrap of paper,"" co-chairs Jeremie Vaneeckhout and Nadia Naji stated. ""Nature and climate go hand in hand. Instead of wanting to press a pause button, we just need to speed up."" The French-speaking socialists, on the other hand, accuse De Croo of not respecting the coalition agreement. ""If we tell polluting industries that they can keep polluting, it is very bad for the environment and this industry will never adapt. In the end, it will be doomed in 10 years' time,"" said Socialist Party President Paul Magnette.The ECB will be bold in taking decisions to bring inflation back to 2%Madrid (Europa Press) – The Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) will bravely tackle the current cycle of interest rate hikes and take the ""delicate"" decisions necessary to return medium-term inflation rates to 2 percent, a ""non-negotiable"" level for the institution's president, Christine Lagarde.She warned that the closer we get to the end of the hiking cycle, which the institution has not yet reached, the more difficult it becomes to gauge the right moment, pace and level to reach the greatest possible consensus within the Governing Council.""So I think we are heading for more delicate decisions in the future, but we will be courageous and take the necessary decisions to bring inflation back to 2 percent,â€ Lagarde said.Lagarde warned that now was quite a critical moment, because inflation was starting to fall and the effectiveness of the measures became tangible. However, she pointed out that we still needed to have high interest rates and it was time to tighten our belts. (19 May)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Photo of EU leaders, Zelensky in front of nude statue is doctored","A doctored photo began circulating on social media in multiple languages in the spring of 2023. It purported to show European Council President Charles Michel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in front of aÂ greyÂ statue with breasts and male genitalia. In fact, the image was altered to superimpose the leaders â€“ from a photo taken in Kyiv in 2023 â€“ against the nude statue found in The Hague.Â ""Shame: they steal, they cheat, they embezzle, they are a disgrace to the world,"" reads a Hungarian Facebook post that was shared more than 200 times since it was posted on May 16, 2023. The post includes a group photo of Michel, von der Leyen and Zelensky, who appear to be posing in front of a naked statue with both male and female features. ""Everything about the West today in one picture...,"" claims another post shared more than 500 times since it was posted on April 13, 2023.None of them mention any alteration of the image.Despite discrepancies of light and pixels that make the image suspect, many users seem to believe it is a genuine photo. ""The background is apt! This is the kind of place only a lousy gang would choose for a photo,â€ said one Internet user. ""Perverted neo-Marxists, disgusting worms,"" added another. Screenshot from Facebook taken on May 23, 2023The false image was shared in other languages too, such as in English and Russian. A simple Google search for the names of the three leaders leads to articles about a summit held in Kyiv on February 3, 2023. Some of the articles include a picture where the politicians can be seen in the same pose, but against a different background. A comparison of the image released by the Ukrainian presidential press service with the false picture shows that the politicians were cut from the original photo.The original image in the AFP photo database (left) and the edited image on the right.At the meeting, EU leaders pledged to support Ukraine ""every step of the way"" in its bid for bloc membership.The provenance of the background can be found through a reverse image search. While AFP was unable to track down the original author of the statue photo, the exact same image has been circulating on social media for some time with comments voicing outrage over the sculpture. For example, a Dutch politician shared it in May 2021. An examination of the details, such as the reflections or the wet spot on the ground, shows that it is the same photo as the one used for the doctored image.The background image (left) and the fake image (right). Markings added by AFPThis is not the first time that the statue has been the subject of misinformation. AFP's Serbian fact-checking team already debunked false claims regarding the same statue in 2022. A reverse search showed that the statue is located in The Hague, in the Netherlands. The sponsor of the piece, the Stroom art centre, describes the statue as ""a totem-like image, (in which) male and female and different visual cultures merge. It is, in all its calmness and vulnerability, a statement for freedom of thought."" EU leaders are a recurring target of misinformation.

"Don’t play with fire: EU revamps crisis response capacities as wildfire season begins
","May 30 marks the start of the wildfire season in the EU. European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ spoke to the enr about crisis response, climate change and the 10th birthday of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC). The summer of 2022 was the hottest summer on record in Europe. It also saw the second worst wildfire season since records are kept, â€œin the number of fires as well as in the number of area burned,â€ Janez LenarÄiÄ, the Slovenian Commissioner in charge of civil protection and humanitarian aid, said in an interview with journalists of the European Newsroom (enr) on Thursday. â€œThe longer term trends unmistakably point to one direction: We are going to face more of this.â€Dry weather in combination with heat is a major driver of forest fires. â€œWe expect a busy, busy summer – this year has already started much drier than average,â€ the Slovenian politician explained, pointing to the â€œvery recentâ€ situation in Portugal, Spain, France and Germany, which had called for fire-fighting aid last year. The record temperatures of 2022 also contributed to record-low water levels of European rivers and lakes, in turn impacting other sectors such as transport or energy, the former Slovenian state secretary said.The past experiences in combination with scientific forecasts of natural disasters were among the key reasons to increase firefighting capacities within the European Union. â€œOn May 30, we will mark the 10th anniversary of the Emergency Response Coordination Centre and its operations,â€ the commissioner said. Contracts will also be distributed to member states who will host the increased capacity of the aerial firefighting fleet.Hope does not constitute good preparedness. Janez LenarÄiÄ, EU-Commissioner for Crisis Management Putting in place measures to prevent fires was becoming more and more important. Especially since the fire season starts earlier and lasts longer than previously – and an â€œoverwhelming majority of wildfiresâ€ are caused by human actions, the Slovenian politician stated.Fires were no longer â€œconfined to the south-eastern part of Europe and the Mediterranean region,â€ the commissioner added. This called for further efforts in response capacities but also in prevention, which was embodied in the Wildfire Prevention Action Plan that included initiatives and recommendations, LenarÄiÄ said. Even though nothing â€œcan be imposed on member states because this is their own national competence.â€â€œDisasters know no bordersâ€: Crisis Management in the EU and beyondThe ERCC is the crisis management hub of the European Commission, the body coordinating emergency response of the EU and its member states – and the engine behind the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which was established in 2001.It tackles man-made disasters such as war, natural disasters such as pandemics, floods, earthquakes and fires, but also works strategically on areas of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear preparedness, as well as logistics, transport, shelter and energy, among others.LenarÄiÄ stated that the ERCC had been â€œquite busyâ€ since the start of the current Commissionâ€™s mandate in 2019. This was due to the Covid-19-pandemic as well as the Russian invasion of Ukraine, but also the â€œincreased frequency and intensity of various weather-related events which show that we are already deep into the climate crisis,â€ he explained, adding that â€œthere are changes that are already irreversibleâ€, which needed to be mitigated.We are in a new normal and this calls for action in all stages of the crisis management cycle, not just in response, but also in particular on prevention and preparedness.Janez LenarÄiÄ, EU-Commissioner for Crisis Management He explained that while according to the legal basis, civil protection was a responsibility of the member states, where the commission played a supportive role, the increased frequency and intensity of natural disasters could ""overwhelm the capacities of individual member states.""Over the past two decades, the Union Civil Protection Mechanism had been â€œactivated on average 20 times per year, meaning once or twice per month,â€ LenarÄiÄ explained. However, there had been a steep increase: Since the beginning of the current Commissionâ€™s mandate, the mechanism had been activated â€œmore than 100 times each year,â€ with an average of â€œone to two [activations] each week.â€Requests for assistance from a country are counted with regard to one specific crisis or disaster. â€œIn this sense, the request from Ukraine – because of the crisis caused by the Russian invasion – counts as one,â€ the crisis management commissioner said, adding that â€œin reality, since the start of the Russian invasion, we have had more than 120 requests or updated requests just from Ukraine.â€ Countries asking for help do not need to be members of the European Union, countries such as Syria and Chile have asked for help in the past.Any country can ask for assistance from the Unionâ€™s Civil Protection Mechanism - and they do so.â€Janez LenarÄiÄ, EU-Commissioner for Crisis Management While LenarÄiÄ said that in 2023, no country had asked for forest fire assistance yet, the fire-fighting capacities at EU level had been increased in preparation for the upcoming fire season from 13 aircraft in 2022: â€œWe will have ten medium amphibious aeroplanes, 14 light amphibious aeroplanes and four medium and heavy helicopters,â€ the commissioner explained, adding that the water caption capacity of the fleet roughly doubled.Itâ€™s not cheap, but necessaryWith the increased number of activations of the mechanism and incidences of help needed, as well as the anticipated increase in frequency and intensity of weather-related disasters, LenarÄiÄ added that the financial resources were â€œbasically the same'' as planned when the current Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) was proposed in 2018 by the Juncker Commission, before the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine.The EU budget for civil protection amounted to â€œabout 1.2 billion euros for the entire seven-year-period and is not adequate in view of the challenges that we face,â€ LenarÄiÄ said. Further EU funding â€œworth about 2 billion euros was allocated in additionâ€, primarily in response to the pandemic and to increase resilience and preparedness for future pandemics.â€œEvery year, we need about 75 million euros of reinforcements. This shows that we will need to place European civil protection on a more solid financial basis, because we already cannot go through a year without reinforcements.""We get reinforcements when we need them. But this is not a very sound basis for the full operation.Janez LenarÄiÄ, EU-Commissioner for Crisis Management â€œGlobal warming is a fact. Its negative impact on climate is a fact. One of the symptoms of this is the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather-related events. So, there is a need to act,â€ LenarÄiÄ remarked, stating the need to â€œrely on scienceâ€ when it came to dealing with those who doubted the reality of climate change. â€œThe green transition will not be cheap. It will cost, it will require investments. But it's important to be aware of the following: If we don't do it, the cost will be much higher for everyone,â€ the commissioner said, adding that the Just Transition Fund was to ensure that the transition did not â€œdisproportionately burdenâ€ those most vulnerable.When disaster strikes: Response, prevention, preparedness, resilienceUnderlining that efforts in the field of preparedness had to be strengthened, LenarÄiÄ explained the recent launch of the so-called Disaster Resilience Goals as a â€œform of recommendations to EU member states.â€ Currently, member states work on their implementation, which is facilitated through an initiative for each Disaster Resilience Goal.â€œThese goals are to anticipate better, then to prepare better, to alert in the sense of improving early warning systems, then to respond. When disaster strikes, you have to organise a response. And finally, to secure the operational status and effectiveness of crisis response mechanisms,â€ LenarÄiÄ said. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Europe in brief: Poland questioned over â€œRussian influenceâ€ law,"A new Polish law that establishes a special committee to investigate Russian influence on the internal security of Poland between 2007 and 2022 is raising eyebrows within the European Commission. French President Emmanuel Macron urges the EU to develop new ways of handling its enlargement. The European Central Bank presents its semi-annual Financial Stability Report.Reynders questions Poland over commission of enquiry into Russian influenceBrussels (Belga) – European Commissioner for Justice Didier Reynders raised concerns over a controversial Polish law on investigating Russian influence. In a letter sent to Polish European Affairs Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel SÄ™k on Wednesday, Reynders asked him to provide the documents on a controversial law allowing the creation of a special commission with the power to exclude people from public office without them being able to go to court.On Monday, President Andrzej Duda put his signature to a law aimed at fighting ""Russian influence"" in the country. The law provides for the creation of a special commission to investigate whether people in public office have acted under Russian influence over the past 15 years and made decisions that harmed Poland's security. The opposition sees the commission as a tool of the national-conservative government led by the Law and Justice Party (PiS) to sideline political opponents in the run-up to parliamentary elections.The Polish opposition has renamed the law the Tusk Law, after the former European Council President and leader of the liberal Civic Platform Party, Donald Tusk. Parliamentary elections will take place in Poland this autumn and the opposition believes the law serves to discredit the government's opponents and prevent Tusk from winning the ballot.In his letter, Commissioner Reynders confirmed that ""this new law raises serious concerns in terms of compliance with EU law, as it confers significant powers on an administrative body that can be used to prohibit individuals from holding public office and thus limit their rights.""Reynders spoke to his Polish counterpart on Wednesday, who offered to provide him with an analysis of the law in question. The Commissioner requests ""without delay all relevant documents related to the legislative process,"" including the opinions of relevant stakeholders, the ombudsman and legislative offices, as well as any other documents deemed relevant.""Those documents will be important for the Commission's assessment to decide on possible next steps,"" Reynders said. All this seems to indicate that a new infringement procedure could be launched. (June 1)Enlargement: Macron calls on the EU to ""rethink"" its governance and invent new formatsBratislava (AFP) – In a speech delivered in Bratislava on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on the European Union to rethink its governance and ""invent several formats"" to meet the membership aspirations of countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.""Yes, it (the EU) must enlarge. Yes, it must be rethought in terms of its governance and its aims. Yes, it must innovate, without doubt, to invent several formats and clarify the aims of each of these formats,"" he declared on the eve of a summit of the European Political Community, which brings together 47 countries in ChiÈ™inÄƒu, the capital of Moldova.""This is the only way to meet the legitimate expectations of the Western Balkans, Moldova and Ukraine, which must join the European Union, and to maintain the geopolitical effectiveness, but also the climate, the rule of law and the economic integration of the European Union as it exists today,"" he insisted, outlining a multi-speed Europe. (May 31)ECB: Outlook for financial stability in the euro area remains fragileFrankfurt/Main (dpa) – According to the European Central Bank (ECB), banks in the euro area remain vulnerable to external shocks. The outlook for financial stability as a whole remained â€œfragile"" against the backdrop of the recent banking stress outside the monetary union, the central bank announced on Wednesday on the occasion of the presentation of its semi-annual Financial Stability Report.In the United States, three regional banks had collapsed since the beginning of March, after huge withdrawals of funds due to liquidity concerns. In Europe, the major bank Credit Suisse, which had already had problems before, had been saved from going under thanks to a state-organised emergency takeover by Swiss competitor UBS. One massive problem for the banks is the rapid rise in interest rates after years of zero and negative interest.The ECB says euro-area financial institutions have coped well with the recent stress ""but higher funding costs and lower asset quality could affect profitability."" Banks may need to set aside more funds for possible loan losses.""In this context, it is essential to complete the banking union and, in particular, to establish a common European deposit insurance scheme,"" the central bank stated. For years, Europeans have been arguing about a cross-border safeguarding of customer funds as the third pillar of the European banking union, alongside joint banking supervision and joint resolution of crisis institutions.There is resistance in Germany, where there are well-filled pots for emergencies. Savings banks and cooperative banks fear that their money will be used to finance the failures of institutions in other countries.

"Point, shoot, edit, publish: Mobile video journalism workshop with AFP","The European Newsroom hosted a two-day workshop on mobile video journalism on June 5-6. Facilitated by AFP, the participants learned the basics of creating content with their smartphones - from the technical and the practical side. Smartphones are in almost everybodyâ€™s pockets these days, they come with large screens and the possibility to shoot video and images with very high quality. The goal of the two-day workshop was to break down the basics of mobile video reporting and how videos are created that can live up to the standard required by broadcasters. News doesn't stop and oftentimes news pieces are enriched with content that was clearly shot on the spot. For example, when it comes to rather spontaneous incidents - filming an altercation between police and protestors, experiencing some type of natural catastrophe but of course, happier situations such as impromptu proposals or the atmosphere at a big sports match.The workshop facilitator, Laurent Kalfala, answered questions as to why one should shoot with a smartphone, showed examples of the early days of smartphone videos in journalism and invited participants to analyse how a story can unfold with the help of images and sound.Further, participants delved deep into the technical side of what their smartphones can do - how do you get the best video and sound quality? Which apps or accessories are helpful?Some impressions of the two-day workshop. Photos: European NewsroomAfterwards, the participants did some fieldwork, applying their new knowledge around Brussels. The practical element of the workshop allowed the participants to get a real example of how video journalism can be done with a smartphone - and where the pitfalls lie.Telling a story in 10-25 shots, 60 to 90 seconds can prove to be quite tricky, especially when the material is vast and rich. Throughout the workshop, participants learned the importance of a good selection as well as the creation of a coherent narrative. Further, they learned about the editing process and the delivery to their respective newsrooms. The small scale of the workshop allowed for a lot of 1-on-1 time with the facilitator, which made participants progress fast.The last part of the workshop included the screening of the participantsâ€™ work. With other colleagues present, they showed their stories which had entirely been shot and edited on their smartphones.Six Journalists from AFP, AGERPRES, ANSA, EFE and HINA participated. ",1
"Chart shows the effect of rainfall, not ‘radioactive cloud’
","After a Russian air strike on the Khmelnytskyi region in western Ukraine on May 13, 2023, charts showing higher levels of radiation were shared on social media in Polish and Slovak. They came with the false claim that the increase stemmed from the fact that ammunition containing â€œdepleted uranium"" had been destroyed in the attack. The charts are real: one shows data on the metallic element bismuth for the Polish city of Lublin, while the other – taken from the European Commission Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring data bank -- shows radioactivity levels for Khmelnytskyi. However, the cause of the higher radiation levels is in fact rain, experts told AFP. Polish, Slovak and Ukrainian authorities -- as well as the International Atomic Energy Agency -- all said that Europeâ€™s radiation levels were ""normal"". On May 13, 2023, Ukrainian authorities announced that Russia had launched air strikes against Khmelnytskyi. That same day, social media users began posting (here, here, here) videos showing a huge explosion. Some of them called it â€œpractically an atomic mushroom cloud"" and claimed it was linked to the destruction of a Ukrainian ammunition depot in Khmelnitskyi.Several Polish social media users claimed that winds from eastern Ukraine were moving the ""cloud"" towards Poland. Some of the posts came with a chart. ""Reports of destroyed Ukrainian warehouses in Khmelnytskyi, where British depleted uranium shells were stored, have been confirmed. Radioactivity has gone up significantly in Khmelnytskyi. Here is a link where you can check European wind directions to see if radioactive fallout will reach Poland,"" read Facebook posts (here and here) published on May 15, 2023, two days after the attack.Screenshot taken on Facebook on May 23, 2023The same claim and chart also appeared on Telegram and Twitter.A Twitter account whose false claims had already previously been verified by AFP also posted a different chart showing bismuth radiation levels. There was a visible spike on May 15. ""Radioactivity in the air in Lublin was 300 times higher than normal on the day the Ukrainian radioactive cloud passed through,"" claimed the misleading tweet. The same chart with the misleading claim was published on Telegram, where it was viewed more than 1,000 times. The chart also appeared in German, Slovak and Bulgarian, with captions claiming that ""the radiation threat came from the Khmelnytskyi region"".Screenshot taken on Twitter on May 23, 2023What happened in Khmelnytskyi? Russia launched a drone attack on Khmelnytskyi Oblast in the early morning of May 13, according to Khmelnytskyi mayor Oleksandr Semchyshyn (here, here, here) and the deputy head of the regionâ€™s military administration, Serhiy Tyurin (here, here and here).Semchyshyn said at the time that the drones struck ""critical infrastructure facilities in the region"" and injured 21 people. Ukrainian media (here, here) and Polish media also reported on the attack. Some Ukrainian news outlets (here, here) wrote that a power station had sustained damage. The state news agency Ukrinform reported that four drones struck Khmelnytskyi.The Russian ministry of defence announced on May 14, 2023 that ""one AFU ammunition depot ha(d) been destroyed close to Khmelnytskyi"". According to the Russian news agency TASS, Russian Security Council secretary Nikolay Patrushev (archived link) said that the destruction of depleted uranium munitions supplied by the West to Ukraine had created a radioactive cloud that was drifting towards Europe. ""An increase in radiation levels has already been registered in Poland,"" he warned, quoted by the agency.Britain did in fact announce in March 2023 that along with its Challenger 2 tanks, it would also send armour-piercing shells containing depleted uranium to Ukraine, as reported by Euronews and the BBC. Delivery was completed in April.However, AFP could not verify whether that type of ammunition was indeed stored at the Khmelnytskyi facilities struck on May 13.Depleted uranium is a by-product of the enrichment process needed to transform naturally occurring uranium into fuel used for generating power or weapons. According to the IAEA, it is ""considerably less radioactive than natural uranium"". â€œThe chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is considered a more significant issue than the possible impacts of its radioactivity,â€ according to a 2022 UN Environment Programme (UNEP) report, which added that depleted uranium was an environmental concern in Ukraine.Chart shows result of rainfallAFP was able to identify the source of both charts. Doing so was easy in the case of posts where we could see the name of the Polish university UMCS on the chart. On the university website, it is possible to select the same timeframe (May 10-16, 2023) and locate the chart in their archives (see comparison below).Comparison of the chart from the misleading post on Twitter (left) and the chart from the UMCS radioactivity monitoring projectThe university, which is located in the eastern city of Lublin, has been measuring radioactivity in the air there to educate residents and show the correlation between natural radiation and the environment. Just like monitoring bodies -- such as the Polish atomic energy agency PAA, or the European Remap -- it measures global radioactive contamination (the radiation dose rate) by looking at two main isotopes in particular (synthetic radioisotopes Caesium Cs-137 and Iodine I-131) and also measures the levels of other characteristic isotopes, including Bismuth (Bi-214) – the one featured in the chart from the misleading posts.We asked the university about the charts. ""Yes, this is one of our charts,"" said Radoslaw Zaleski, who is in charge of the monitoring project. ""It shows bismuth data that we measured at UMCS,â€ he told AFP on May 23.He said that unlike Cs-137, which does not exist naturally but is produced by nuclear fission, the isotope Bi-214 is formed by the decay of radon gas rising naturally from the ground. It is intercepted by falling water droplets and when it rains, bismuth falls to the ground. Simply put, the more it rains, the more bismuth will be detected and the curve on the chart will go up, only to go down on a sunny day.â€œSuch increases occur practically every time it rains and are not dangerous at all for humans,"" Zaleski said. ""What should put us on alert is the presence of two other isotopes (Iodine and Caesium) on the main chart"". ""There, the red line shows an alarming level. In May, it was far below the red line (see online) as there was no radioactive contamination caused by either an incident at a nuclear power plant or nuclear weapons,"" he said. In the table below the chart, we can read that Iodine I-131 and Caesium Cs-137 were ""not detected"".""People are afraid of radiation but in reality we are all immersed in it on a daily basis. We are exposed to it all the time. It comes from the Earth's crust and from solar radiation,"" he added. ""The word 'uranium' scares people. It is important to know that depleted uranium has very low radioactivity and, unlike enriched uranium, cannot be used in nuclear weapons,"" he said.""Such small fluctuations do not impact our health, and even if they did, they are virtually unavoidable,â€ he said.The fluctuations in radiation occurred on days when there was rainfall, as shown in the below comparison between the amount of precipitation and radiation intensity (recorded by the UMCS) over the course of a month.A comparison of the amount of precipitation (upper chart) and radiation intensity for the previous month as recorded by UMCS. Screenshot by AFP on May 24, 2023In the chart below, we can see many Bi-214 spikes over the course of the year, including in January, February and April. They all correspond to meteorological phenomena. Some were even higher than the one observed after May 13.Screenshot of UMCS chart taken on May 24, 2023Indicators for Khmelnytskyi â€˜do not exceedâ€™ the norm By searching the websites of institutions that monitor radioactivity, we located the second chart used in some of the misleading posts. We found it among the radiological maps of the European Commission Radioactivity Environmental Monitoring data bank (REMdb). The map features the blue colour typical of European institution websites. The data bank was created in the aftermath of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster to ""store the radioactivity monitoring data gathered through the national environmental monitoring programmes of the member states"".We searched for Khmelnytskyi on the radiation map, selected the same dates as in the posts (May 7-14) and obtained the same chart (below).Comparison of the chart from the misleading post on Facebook (left) and the chart from the EU radioactivity map for KhmelnytskyWe asked the EC REMdb about the chart. In a May 28 email, its representative Juan Carlos de la Rosa Blul confirmed to AFP that the map came from REMdb. He added that specific questions about the data should be directed to the institution that provided the data for station UA33429 in Khmelnitsky, namely the Ukrainian inspectorate.Contacted by AFP, a spokesman for the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine wrote to AFP on May 26 that ""during the period from May 11 to 18, no increases in the permissible radiation background standards were recorded in Khmelnytsky region. The daily fluctuations of gamma radiation were and are currently within the permissible limits, as has been the case for many years of observation. Due to the distribution of fake information in the European media, we provided up-to-date information on the radiation background in Ukraine to our international partners,"" including the IAEA and European regulators. He also mentioned a map of the radiation background in Ukraine that is constantly updated.Researchers from Khmelnytskyi National University went to the site after the May 13 air strike. They denied that radioactivity had increased in the city and the surrounding areas. ""After information spread on social media that the increased radiation in Khmelnytskyi was a consequence of the attack on May 13, scientists from Khmelnytskyi National University measured the radiation background (gamma radiation doses) in the city of Khmelnytsky on May 15-16,"" reads an article (archived link) on the Ukrainian education ministryâ€™s website.""The obtained values are 0.12-0.15 Î¼Sv/h and correspond to long-term indicators for the territory of Khmelnytskyi and do not exceed the norm (0.3 Î¼Sv/h). Based on the measurement results, it can be stated that there is no reason to be concerned about an increase in the radiation background in Khmelnytskyi,"" the article concludes. The levels (120 to 150 nSv/h) are almost the same as those on the chart from the misleading posts, which shows 150 nSv/h from May 12.AFP also asked Slovak officials about the chart. Magdalena Vicanova, head of the Slovak public health authorityâ€™s radiation protection department, confirmed on May 23 that the levels observed occur naturally and â€œare not a threat to human healthâ€.Screenshot taken on Remap on May 26We checked the data for the days between May 18 and 25. The radiation level was back down to 70 nSv/h on May 18 (below).Screenshot taken on Remap on May 26We know that the attack took place early in the morning on May 13. The first post on Telegram by local authorities was at 4 am local time that day. But the EU chart shows an increase of radiation starting May 12 – so before the attack. It is incomprehensible for the effects to have preceded the attack itself, according to Zaleski.The European Commission representative also pointed out that the increase occurred prior to the incident.â€˜Normalâ€™ radiation levels AFP asked the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna about the alleged radioactive cloud.""The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been informed by its counterparts in Ukraine and Poland that the radiation levels in both countries are normal. The slight increases measured are linked to naturally occurring fluctuations in radiation levels, present no risk to public health or the environment and are routinely observed,"" Frederik Dahl, an IAEA spokesman, told AFP on May 23.On May 17, the Polish atomic energy agency PAA denied the claims of a possible radioactive threat in Poland. It called the reports â€œfalseâ€ and reassured residents that the ""radiation situation in the country is normal"".The PAA explained that the UMCS charts ""show elevated values of bismuth-214. This is also an effect of precipitation. Bismuth-214 (...) naturally occurs on the earth's surface and in the atmosphere in the form of aerosols. When it rains, aerosols containing Bi-214 are lifted from the earth's surface and also leached from the atmosphere"".The Polish Institute of Meteorology and Water Management IMGW, which also monitors radioactivity levels, said that there had been no health hazard. ""We checked our data, though we have far fewer stations than the PAA, and in our case, we did not record anything dangerous,"" spokesman Grzegorz Walijewski told AFP on May 23.In Slovakia, where the false claims was also shared on social media, the Public Health Office published a press release on May 18 (link archived here) describing the claims as ""misinformation"" and stressing that ""values in Slovakia and Poland are normal"".""A lot of misinformation appeared in Slovakia about increased radiation in connection with the events in the area of the Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi,"" Branislav Chvila, director of the Hydrometeorological Institute SHMU, said that same day.

Europe in brief: EU offers closer partnership with Central Asia,"European Council President Charles Michel wants to intensify the blocâ€™s relationship with Central Asia. The new Bulgarian government is about to start work. Albania and Hungary strengthen their cooperation. Germany escapes a fine as the European Commission ends water pollution proceedings.Cholpon-Ata, Kyrgyzstan (AFP) – The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, on June 2 called for a ""sincere partnership"" with the countries of Central Asia to strengthen the EU's footprint in this region which is being ardently courted by major powers including China against the background of a weakening Russia.""We can offer a sincere partnership"" to the five former Soviet republics of Central Asia and the EU can ""be a respectful partner who creates confidence"", Michel told AFP on the sidelines of the second ""European Union-Central Asia"" summit in Kyrgyzstan.The presidents of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and a delegation from reclusive Turkmenistan attended the summit in the Kyrgyz city of Cholpon-Ata. Michel highlighted the possibilities of cooperation in the field of ""climate technologies, energy issues, security, transport and tourism"". (June 2, 2023)New Bulgarian government expected to start work within daysSofia (BTA) – The two strongest blocs in the Bulgarian parliament, the centre-right GERB-SDS and the reformist ""We continue the change – Democratic Bulgaria"" (DPS), have agreed to form a coalition government with a rotating prime minister.""I thank GERB-SDS, PP-DB and DPS for putting the interests of the citizens above the party interests and clearly stating the Euro-Atlantic orientation of the countryâ€, said Maria Gabriel, who will be deputy prime minister for nine months and then head the government. ""It will be very difficult, but we are convinced that this step is useful for Bulgaria. If the changes we are embarking on go in the wrong direction, we will both resign"", added Prime Minister-designate Nikolay Denkov. The government is expected to be approved by an extraordinary session of the National Assembly on June 6. (June 2-5, 2023)Albania and Hungary pledge stronger cooperationTirana (ATA) – Albanian President Bajram Begaj welcomed the president of Hungary, Katalin Novak, for a state visit on June 1. After the official welcome ceremony at the Presidency, the delegations held a meeting that focused on bilateral cooperation, the European integration process of Albania and other countries of the Western Balkans as well as on current developments in the region.At a press conference, Begaj conveyed his regret to President Novak that Hungarian soldiers were injured by Serbian protester in northern Kosovo two days ago during the current tensions. Begaj appreciated the history of good relations between the two countries. He noted that Hungary has unconditionally supported the integration of Albania and other Western Balkan countries into the European Union.Begaj underlined the geopolitical importance of the Western Balkans region, especially in the new geopolitical environment in which malicious actors were seeking its destabilisation. He focused on the importance of supporting the Kosovo-Serbia dialogue as well as supporting Pristina in its bid to join international organisations including the Council of Europe. Hungary is present in the region with investments, but also with political and technical support some of which is provided within the framework of cooperation with the Visegrad Group. (June 1, 2023)Germany escapes fine as EU Commission ends water pollution proceedingsBrussels (dpa) – Germany has escaped an EU fine in a dispute over nitrate-polluted water. The EU Commission announced on June 1 that it had closed proceedings against the country. Rules introduced by the German federal and state governments now complied with EU law and addressed the need to tackle high nitrate levels in waters. Most of the nitrate comes from agricultural fertilisers. Excessive quantities of nitrate are harmful to the environment and pos risks to public health.If Germany had been found guilty it would have faced a fine of at least 17.25 million euros and a penalty payment of up to 1.1 million euros per day, according to the German government. The exact amount of the penalty is determined by the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The daily penalty payment is aimed at increasing the pressure on a country to bring its rules into line with EU law quickly.The dispute over fertiliser pollution had been going on for years. The ECJ had already found Germany guilty in 2018 of violating EU law by doing too little to combat high levels of nitrate in groundwater for years.Nitrate is important for plant growth. But if too much fertiliser is used, residues accumulate in groundwater, streams, rivers and the sea. Stricter fertiliser regulations came into force in Germany in 2020 following tough negotiations. However, the EU Commission criticised them in mid-2021.EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius had written to the German environment minister at the time, Svenja Schulze, and then-Farming Minister Julia KlÃ¶ckner that the fertiliser regulations that came into force in 2020 might fall short of complying with the ECJ ruling. The criticisms voiced by the Commissioner included that areas in Germany with high nitrate pollution in the groundwater and harmful nutrient accumulation had not been correctly identified.Now Germany appears to have done enough to satisfy the EU: measures include longer blocking periods during which fertiliser must not be used at all, a fertiliser ban for frozen soil and stricter rules for fertilising sloping areas, the Commission said, adding: ""These rules will reduce the negative impact on soil and water resources.""

Press Briefing: enr hosts Eurobarometer presentation on European Elections 2024,"On June 6 - one year ahead of the next European Elections - the European Newsroom hosted the press briefing â€œONE YEAR TO GO: THE EUROPEAN ELECTIONSâ€ which presented the European Parliamentâ€™s Spring Eurobarometer data at the offices of Belga New Agency. European Parliament President Roberta Metsola spoke to journalists via video message, underlining that the latest Eurobarometer data show an â€œincreased interestâ€ in the next European elections as well as stating that â€œtwo out of three say that they would likely vote if the elections are held next week.â€ She further urged young people in particular to make use of their right to vote to â€keep our democracies alive and to shape the European Union that we will live in.â€The next European Elections will be held from June 6-9 2024. The Spring Eurobarometer collects data on public opinion towards the European Union as well as the elections next year.Jaume Duch Guillot, European Parliament spokesperson and Director General for Communication, and Philipp Schulmeister, Director for Campaigns and former Head of Public Opinion Monitoring presented the latest data and answered questions from journalists who attended the briefing  in person and online.Duch Guillot explained that the higher interest is likely linked to the increased visibility of the European Union in recent years due to multiple crises including the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine.The Eurobarometer data was collected between 2 and 26 March 2023 in all 27 member states. In total, 26.376 persons above the age of 15 were polled for their views.The survey included questions around the subjects of democracy, approval of the EU as well as actions of countriesâ€™ own governments among others. While the awareness of the elections is higher than in comparison to the data collected in 2019, half of the people surveyed  ""see their own standard of living in decline and expect it to decrease even further,"" according to the results.Among the topics the European Parliament should prioritise, the respondents highlight the fight against poverty and social exclusion (38%), public health (33%) and climate change (31%), and support for business and new jobs (31%).Here is a selection of pictures from the event (Â© European Union 2023 - Source : EP/Alain ROLLAND):The briefing was well received with around 30 journalists attending in person.

Europeans attach greater importance to EU elections ahead of 2024 vote,"The countdown to the 2024 European Parliament elections has begun. On Tuesday, the European Parliament published and presented the results of its Spring 2023 Eurobarometer survey.The figures contained in the Spring Eurobarometer, published on Tuesday exactly one year ahead of the 2024 EU elections, show increased levels of interest in and awareness of these elections, as well as of the impact of the European Union on everyday life. The next EU elections are to be held on June 6-9, 2024, when the current five-year term ends. The higher interest is probably linked to the increased visibility of the EU in recent years due to multiple crises including the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia's war on Ukraine, European Parliament spokesman and Director General for Communication Jaume Duch Guillot said.The president of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, stressed the importance of the EU elections when she announced the results of the Eurobarometer via video message at a press conference in Brussels organised by the European Newsroom (enr). She said that taking part in the elections was a chance to stand up for all the issues important to EU citizens. She called on ""everyone, especially young people, to vote and in doing so shape the Union they want to live in"".According to Jaume Duch Guillot, young Europeans must realise that the 2024 EU elections will influence the EU for the next decade and will have a key impact on their lives.Are voters ready to vote?Sixty-seven percent of Europeans said they would be likely to vote in European Parliament elections if they were held next week. Ahead of the previous polls in 2019, 58 percent said they were interested in voting and the actual turnout ended up at around 51 percent. The willingness to vote varies across Europe:In Belgium, where compulsory voting applies, 73 percent of respondents said that they would vote. A total of 58 percent of Slovenian voters said they would likely cast a vote in the European elections if they were held this week, nine percentage points below the EU average. Slightly more than half of Croatia's voters (53 percent ) said they would likely go to the polls if the European elections were held next week. Only the Czech Republic recorded a lower score than Croatia with 50 percent of its citizens saying they would be likely to vote if the elections were held next week.According to the survey, 64 percent of Italians said they would be likely to vote if the European elections were held any day, a figure slightly lower than the EU average. Italy is among the countries where interest in European politics has grown the most since the Ukraine war and the pandemic, rising from 47 percent in 2018 to 58 percent today, higher than the EU average of 56 percent.Asked what motivated them to go out and vote in European elections, most respondents cited a ""civic duty"" to cast their ballot, the habit of voting in elections and the desire to support a political party. These three factors came above ""wanting to change things"", supporting a specific candidate or expressing support for the EU. In contrast, reasons that keep turnout in European elections lower than in other elections at national level include the belief that a vote will not change anything, a lack of interest in politics in general and distrust of politics, as well as a belief that what happens in the European Parliament ""does not concern them."" The majority of Bulgarians (57 percent), for example, are uninterested in the European elections that will take place in June 2024.Slovakia has always had the lowest voter turnout in previous European Parliament elections. Even though the Slovaks' interest in European Parliament elections has risen since the last vote – with the survey showing that 26 percent of Slovaks are interested in voting in the 2024 elections – the figure still puts Slovakia in last place again in terms of voter turnout.Asked what Slovaks need to do to reverse this unfavourable trend, Duch Guillot said that a ""domestic solution"" is mainly in the hands of politicians, the government, the parliament and the media. ""People still trust the media, or some part of the media, the most. They should learn the lessons of the last four to five years, when the EU's actions in various crises have had a clear impact on people's daily lives,"" he said.Philipp Schulmeister, Director for Campaigns and former head of the Public Opinion Monitoring Unit at the European Parliament presents the Eurobarometer data. Photo: European Union 2023 - Source : EP/Alain ROLLANDSupport for Ukraine boosts the figuresDuch Guillot noted that the EU had dealt with the impact of Brexit, the coronavirus crisis and the need to ensure that the population was vaccinated and economies recovered after the pandemic. Currently, it was responding unitedly to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.""All these elements show that the EU is much more important to people today than it was five years ago, meaning that the importance of the European Parliament and its members has grown and will continue to grow,"" said Duch Guillot.More respondents approved of the EUâ€™s support for Ukraine, with an average of 76 percent across the bloc. Approval rates, however, differed between member states. In Sweden, 97 percent backed the EU's help for Ukraine, compared with 51 percent in Slovakia and 68 percent in Germany. Sixty-one percent of Italians viewed EU support for Ukraine favourably. Support for Ukraine in Bulgaria was 54 percent and disapproval was at 39 percent.Cost-of-living crisis drags down satisfactionCost-of-living woes are focusing European voters' minds one year before they go to the polls to choose a new European parliament. Half of the 26,376 respondents questioned across all 27 EU countries for the Eurobarometer survey ""see their own standard of living in decline and expect it to decrease even further,"" according to the results.""All that weighs indeed heavily on people,"" acknowledged Philipp Schulmeister, Director for Campaigns and former head of the Public Opinion Monitoring Unit at the European Parliament. ""Citizens see very quickly how much they have left in their purse at the end of the month,"" he added.The figures showed that 81 percent of the respondents in Bulgaria were unhappy with national measures against the higher cost of living. More than half (61 percent) of Bulgarians said they were dissatisfied with measures taken at the European level.In France, 74 percent were not happy with the way their government has been handling the cost-of-living crisis, while in Germany 59 percent were dissatisfied. In Belgium, 54 percent of respondents were dissatisfied with the measures their government has taken to tackle the high cost of living, and 55 percent of Belgians were dissatisfied about what the EU has done in that regard. In Croatia, 38 percent of the respondents said they were satisfied with the way things work in the EU, while 48 percent were not satisfiedIn Spain, 66 percent of respondents – the same proportion as in Greece and only surpassed by 76 percent in Cyprus – said their standard of living had already deteriorated or that it would get worse in the coming year.However, there was ""optimism"" in the figures ""that the European Union will be able to deliver,"" Schulmeister stressed. ""This is not the story of everything is well and good, this is a story of expectation and also of learned trust,"" he said. Sixty-four percent of Europeans said they felt that things were going â€œin the right directionâ€ in their lives and, for example, 69 percent of Spaniards shared this feeling of optimism.Duch Guillot: survey results not affected by â€˜Qatargateâ€™Duch Guillot said the survey didn't indicate that European voters' trust in EU institutions had been rocked by a graft scandal at the European Parliament known as ""Qatargate.""Several lawmakers and parliamentary aides were arrested in a Belgian probe into the suspected bribery of MEPs to promote the interests of Qatar and Morocco. Both countries deny any wrongdoing.However, 60 percent of respondents said they were not satisfied with the bloc's fight against corruption, including 22 percent who were ""not at all satisfied."" Over half of Bulgarians – 53 percent – said they were unhappy with the fight against disinformation, and 60 percent with efforts against corruption. Only 22 percent of Slovenian respondents are happy with the fight against corruption, which is 13 points lower than across the EU.This article is published Fridays.

Europe in brief: Rome calls on Tripoli to increase efforts to combat human trafficking,"Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is worried about the level of migrant landings in Italy. EU and US envoys want Kosovo and Serbia to find a political solution to their conflict. Albania, France and Germany have signed a cooperation agreement to reform the Albanian energy sector. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is lukewarm about the idea of a European Union army. Rome (ANSA) – A possible increase in migrant landings this summer is worrying the government in Rome. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni made that clear to the premier of Libyaâ€™s interim government of national unity, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah. While expressing appreciation for the efforts put in place by Tripoli so far, she said ""it is essential to intensify efforts in the field of human trafficking"".In the first five months of 2023, 52,328 people landed in Italy, up from 21,000 in the same period last year and 15,000 in 2021. In March 2023, the count stood at 8,155, about the same as in June 2022, before the surge to almost 17,000 last August. The government is concerned that the trend will be similar or more serious in the coming months. Uncertainties linked to Tunisia are weighing heavily. Meloni recently visited Tunisia and could return in a few days with Ursula von der Leyen to continue the mediation between Tunis, the EU and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and unblock financial aid to the country which is on the verge of default.The other area of â€‹â€‹serious instability is Libya, where Italy also has significant interests in the energy sector. ""The stabilisation of Libya and its political framework is a priority for Italy, for national security and for energy diversification"", Meloni reiterated to the Libyan leader. They also discussed ""the importance of holding Libyan presidential and parliamentary elections as soon as possible, also with the mediation of the United Nations and the UN Representative Bathily."" Abdoulaye Bathily is the Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Libya and Head of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. (June 7, 2023).EU and US envoys visit Belgrade and PristinaBrussels/Belgrade (Tanjug) – The Special Representative of the European Union for dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, Miroslav LajÄak, said violence was never acceptable and that it was urgently necessary to find a political solution to the current crisis in northern Kosovo. He emphasized that he appreciated Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡'s willingness to contribute to that.LajÄak announced that he and the US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State and US Special Envoy for the Western Balkans, Gabriel Escobar, had long talks with VuÄiÄ‡ in Belgrade about the complex situation of the Serbs in Kosovo and Metohija. The Serbian presidency said in a statement after the meeting: ""VuÄiÄ‡ reiterated the full commitment of the Republic of Serbia to the process of dialogue with PriÅ¡tina, to achieving compromise and sustainable solutions for a better life and relations between Serbs and Albanians, and as a key demand he underlined the security of our people in Kosovo and Metohija"".VuÄiÄ‡ also reiterated his insistence on the full implementation of the Brussels Agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, first and foremost the formation of the Union of Serbian Municipalities, and called on the international community to engage more with Pristina to achieve that, the statement said. (June 7)International cooperation to reform the Albanian electricity sectorTirana (ATA) – Albania, Germany and France signed a financial cooperation agreement that will contribute to the second phase of support for the reform of the Albanian electricity sector. The agreement was signed in Tirana on June 6 by the Albanian Minister of Infrastructure and Energy Belinda Balluku, and the ambassadors of France and Germany, Elisabeth Barsacq and Peter Zingraf. The State Secretary at the German Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development, Niels Annen, was present at the signing.International partners are supporting Albania in the transformation of its energy sector with a loan of 100 million euros. Deputy Prime Minister Balluku emphasized that the partners appreciated the commitment of the Albanian Ministry of Infrastructure and Energy to carrying out this challenging reform. She said the measures had brought the sector into line with EU requirements and parameters.Balluku pointed out that the financial agreement will contribute to the second phase of support for the Albanian electricity sector, which has been hit by economic problems in the last year stemming from the energy crisis in the wake of the Russian aggression in Ukraine. ""Last year we imported significant quantities to avoid power outages for all customers, so we were exposed to the crazy prices of the worldwide electricity market"", said Balluku. (June 6, 2023)Scholz cautious on idea of European army – Von der Leyen supports itBerlin (dpa) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed reservations about the idea of â€‹â€‹a European Union army. ""We should first do what is pending now,"" Scholz said in Berlin at the ""Europe Forum"" of broadcaster WDR. First of all, it was necessary to strengthen European cooperation in arms production to make it more efficient, he said, adding that security in Europe could only be guaranteed through trans-Atlantic cooperation. ""I am firmly convinced that it is about strengthening trans-Atlantic cooperation and NATO.""EU Commission President Ursula von Leyen, on the other hand, supported the idea of â€‹â€‹an ""army of Europeans"" at the event. ""A lot of member states are naturally in NATO. It's good that we have NATO,"" von der Leyen said. ""But NATO is not everywhere. And there are certainly scenarios where the European Union is called upon. And we have to be in a position to take action.""The big and difficult question was who would take the decision to deploy a European army, she said. ""Aa lot of discussion is still needed."" Von der Leyen said she had great respect for the responsibility one shouldered when sending men and women to crisis areas. ""It has to be supported at the European level, but also at the national level, because it can be a matter of life and death."" She emphasised: ""Such thoughts have to be refined and deepened, but the direction is right."" (June 6, 2023)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Beware of this fake Ukraine combat offer that promises EU citizenship,"Ukraine combat experience does not pave the way for EU or British citizenship. Yet, a fake job offer circulating on social media guarantees just that. It invites citizens of the Middle East and North Africa to join the Ukrainian army in exchange for ""accelerated citizenship in the UK or EU"". This claim is false. According to experts consulted by AFP, the process of acquiring EU or British citizenship is long, complex and requires ticking many boxes, and fighting in Ukraine is not among them. A recent job offer for a ""military maintenance technician"" said it was seeking people to ""participate in the Ukrainian counteroffensiveâ€. In exchange, it claimed that ""accelerated citizenship in the UK or EU is guaranteed"". The ad was initially posted to a British job search site on May 12, 2023 and has since been repeatedly shared on social media (1, 2).Promising a salary of 20,000 pounds, the offer explains that the contract is linked to the ""EU citizenship programme"". A contact name and email address are provided for applicants. The offer however is fake: fighting in Ukraine does not make it any easier to become an EU or British citizen.Screenshot taken on Twitter on May 24, 2023No EU citizenship programme The European Commission told AFP on May 23, 2023 that there is no ""European Union citizenship programme"". Instead, there is an EU programme called Citizens, Equality, Rights and Values"", whose objective is ""to protect and promote rights and values as enshrined in the EU Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. In particular, by supporting civil society organisations active at local, regional, national and transnational level.""But the Commission stressed that the programme has nothing to do with acquiring citizenship. There is no mention of accelerated EU citizenship in the documents annexed to the programmeâ€™s description (1, 2, 3, 4). What's more, to become a citizen of the European Union, one must first become a citizen of an EU member state.Member state jurisdictionAs guardian of the treaties, the European Commission explains that ""every person holding the nationality of a Member State shall be a citizen of the Union. Citizenship of the Union shall be additional to and not replace national citizenshipâ€. That rule is included in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.Excerpt from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European UnionAccording to the Commission, a system that accelerates the acquisition of EU citizenship ""cannot exist"" because ""the law does not provide for this in that order"". The French information site Viepublique.fr explains that citizenship ""is attributed exclusively by the member state"". It is therefore up to each member state to decide on their own rules for obtaining citizenship. The authorities of every EU nation choose whether or not to confer citizenship on a person.Myriam Benlolo-Carabot, a professor of public and European law at the University of Nanterre, does not rule out the possibility that certain member states could introduce ""as a 'reward' the conferral of citizenship for acts of heroism"".One country that has already taken such measures is Russia. As AFP reported in September 2022, Moscow has made Russian citizenship easier to obtain for foreign nationals who fight in its army. Individuals who have served for at least one year can apply for citizenship without the usual requirement of having lived in Russia for at least five years. ""For an African national to become an EU citizen, they must obtain citizenship of a member state of (the European Union). There is no other way. Citizenship of a (member state) is an essential prerequisite,"" Benlolo-Carabot said.  As for the United Kingdom, which is no longer an EU member, it decides on its own terms of citizenship conferral like any other country. The interior ministry site provides all of the relevant details. For example, non-nationals born in the UK are eligible for citizenship depending on when they were born and their parents' circumstances. There is no mention of a sped-up citizenship process for those who have joined the Ukrainian army. Acquiring the citizenship of an EU member is a long and often difficult process. In France, for example, the public service website explains that the requirements vary depending on whether the person was born abroad or in France. In both cases, the person is required to have lived in France for a certain period of time. Combat experience in Ukraine is not one of the criteria that make it easier to become French. France does offer the possibility of obtaining French citizenship on the basis of military service, but the rule only applies to its own army.A person ""may also acquire French nationality on a proposal from the minister of defence"" and the individual ""can be naturalised if he was wounded on a mission during an operational engagement,"" according to France's public service website. Interior ministry figures from 2022 show that the number of French naturalisations has gone down to 78,111 from 94,092 in 2021. Last year's level was similar to pre-pandemic numbers (77,778 in 2018, 76,710 in 2019). Berfin TOPALTous ses articlesAFP FranceTous ses articlesTranslated by Anna Maria JAKUBEKConflit ukrainien-russeFacebook Twitter Facebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Justice ministers agree on anti-SLAPP measures,"EU justice ministers reach an agreement on measures to better protect journalists and human rights activists. The European Commission approves a Slovenian scheme aimed at promoting the use of renewable energy. The Council of Europe welcomes the adoption of changes to the legislation of the Bulgarian justice system.EU countries want better protection for journalists against harassment claimsLuxembourg (dpa) - EU countries want journalists and human rights activists to be better protected against unjustified lawsuits. At a meeting in Luxembourg on Friday, EU justice ministers agreed that judges should be able to dismiss manifestly unfounded lawsuits in court as quickly as possible, according to a statement by the Council of Ministers. This is a crucial step to improve the protection of freedom of speech in the EU and of the work of journalists and activists, it said.German Justice Minister Marco Buschmann said intimidation and threats at the expense of freedom of reporting were unacceptable. Freedom of the press, media and opinion was a valuable asset. Specifically, the plans concern so-called SLAPP lawsuits. The abbreviation SLAPP stands for ""strategic lawsuits against public participation."" According to the Council of Ministers, there are more and more of these cases aimed at intimidating or silencing people who speak out on issues of public interest.Another alleged aim of such proceedings is to put journalists under financial pressure. EU countries want courts to be able to rule that SLAPP plaintiffs have to bear the trial and defence costs. It was also agreed on Friday that judges should be able to impose deterrent penalties on plaintiffs.According to a report by a coalition of non-governmental organisations from across Europe (CASE), 570 such SLAPP cases were filed in more than 30 European jurisdictions between 2010 and 2021. The agreement of the EU states was based on a proposal by the European Commission. It now has to be approved by the European Parliament. (9 June)Brussels approves Slovenian renewable energy incentive schemeBrussels (STA) – The European Commission has approved a 150-million-euro Slovenian scheme to promote the use of renewable energy sources. Under the scheme, aid will be granted in the form of direct grants of up to 25 million euros per beneficiary, Brussels has announced.The Commission found that the scheme is necessary and appropriate to accelerate the transition to renewables and facilitate the development of economic activities relevant for the implementation of the REPowerEU plan and the European Green Deal.Last September, the Slovenian government adopted the first long-term roadmap for achieving the targets to promote the production and use of renewable energy.As explained at the time by the Slovenian Ministry of Infrastructure, the Long-term Roadmap is a key document which is both a comprehensive overview of all available measures and incentives and a basis for ensuring the stability of financial support, including through the definition of a specific earmarked use of the funding for renewable energy sources. (9 June)Council of Europe welcomes Bulgarian reforms to ensure effective investigationsSofia/Strasbourg/Brussels (BTA) – The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe has welcomed the adoption of key changes to Bulgarian legislation to enable the independent investigation of offences including those committed by a Prosecutor General. Changes also introduce a judicial review of refusals to initiate pre-trial proceedings for serious crimes and for certain other crimes related to violations of the European Convention on Human Rights and corruption.In Sofia, the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) had for several days been considering a procedure for the early dismissal of Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev for using the expression ""political garbage"" in reference to MPs during a press conference. On Monday, the SJC voted to dismiss Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev. To take effect, the SJC's decision for his early dismissal needs to be decreed by the President.The European Commission, meanwhile, presented data showing that Bulgaria spends more on its justice system as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) than any other EU member state. For 2019-2021, spending amounted to around 0.7 percent of GDP. The country also has some of the highest salaries for supreme court judges and senior prosecutors relative to the average pay in Bulgaria and ranks fourth in the EU for the number of judges and ninth for the number of lawyers relative to the population.The data also showed that, according to a poll among Bulgarian citizens, only three percent rate the independence of the Bulgarian courts as ""very good"", 28 percent consider it ""good"", 31 percent as ""poor"" and 27 percent as ""very poor"".A poll among companies showed that five percent rate the independence of the Bulgarian courts as ""very good"", 27 percent as ""good enough"", 33 percent as ""bad"" and 14 percent as ""very bad"".Nine percent of investors have very high confidence in the courts and the rule of law in Bulgaria, 34 percent have ""good"" confidence, 34 percent expressed a lack of confidence and 19 percent a ""complete lack of confidence.""More than half of the representatives of the business community cited political and other external influence over the system as the main reasons for their distrust. (8-9 June)WHO: Slovakia is underutilising the opportunities offered by health dataBratislava (TASR) – Slovakia collects enough health data but its use of that information is insufficient and often chaotic, according to experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) who visited Slovakia last week and evaluated the countryâ€™s systems for processing health data.""Based on the findings, the experts said that communication between individual organisations and institutions in the context of data sharing is not clearly set up, which sometimes unnecessarily duplicates not only processes, but also results,"" the Slovak Health Ministry said. This delays government action by forcing it to create new procedures and rules in response to crises, experts said.The preliminary conclusions were heard by Slovak Health Minister Michal PalkoviÄ on Friday. ""Personally, I perceive the number of information systems used by individual health care providers, which, moreover, are not compatible with each other, as one of the biggest problems in the management of health data. This problem has also been pointed out by colleagues from the WHO,"" the minister said.He pointed out that Slovakia also lacked centralised data collection and had shortcomings in the security and validation of data. Thus, although the data often reached the places where it was needed, the lack of coordination of mechanisms meant that it did not reach the people who would actually be able to use it adequately in the health system.The experts' summary will be developed into a detailed evaluation report which should be available within weeks. ""I believe that the final report from the WHO will help Slovak institutions to move where they need to go in this area, faster than we could have done on our own,"" the health minister said. (9 June)EU member states agree on solidarity mechanism and external border procedureLuxembourg (Belga) – On Thursday night, after negotiations that dragged on for years, European Union member states agreed on a new asylum and migration management system. There will be a compulsory but flexible solidarity mechanism to better spread asylum seekers across the EU, and a new procedure at the external borders to return rejected asylum seekers faster.An agreement was close, but still threatened to slip through the Swedish presidency's fingers, because Italy asked for more scope to return migrants to safe third countries. In the vote on the hotly debated final compromise proposal, the Italian minister finally gave his approval. The revamped asylum and migration system guarantees Rome sufficient funds to carry out its tasks and allows it to make bilateral agreements with third countries.Hungary and Poland were the only countries to vote against the changes, with Malta, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Lithuania and the Czech Republic abstaining. Under the new system, asylum seekers will be screened at the EU's external borders and the member states where they arrive must provide sufficient capacity for this – in closed centres or otherwise. A lower limit has been set on the number of applications to be processed annually and the minimum number of places to be provided for this purpose.Those not entitled to asylum should be able to be sent back more quickly; those entitled to it would enter the revamped, streamlined European asylum procedure. The first country of entry would still be responsible for handling this in most cases, but a solidarity mechanism has been devised to relieve the 'frontline states' – currently Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain. The other EU countries will have to take in a certain number of asylum seekers, or provide a sum of money per refused relocation – hence the principle of compulsory but flexible solidarity.On Thursday, figures, amounts and targets were negotiated. It was agreed that 120,000 asylum seekers should be screened annually at the external borders and that at least 30,000 places should be provided for that purpose. Also, 30,000 asylum seekers should be spread across Europe each year on the basis of the solidarity principle, but as with asylum capacity, this is a target that will be updated each year, in relation to actual migration flows. Countries that want to pay money instead of taking in migrants will have to pay 20,000 euros per person to do so.Member states also agreed on a distribution key for the number of migrants they take over. For Belgium, in the case of 30,000 relocations (that figure is revised every year), this would mean taking in 957 people.Swedish Migration Minister Maria Malmer Stenergard, who chaired the meeting, said the two regulations were the cornerstones of the new migration and asylum pact, and crucial for the â€œbalance between responsibility and solidarity.â€ Belgian State Secretary Nicole de Moor said a â€œvery big hurdleâ€ had been taken. On the two legal texts, however, member states still need to reach agreements with the European Parliament. It is possible that those negotiations wonâ€™t take place until Belgium has the rotating EU presidency, in the first half of 2024.

"Lindner on EU's debt rules: we need the best solution, not the fastest one","The EU's debt and deficit rule reform is one of the hottest topics this year. Critics say the rules are no longer up to date. After being suspended for the first time due to the Covid-19 pandemic, they are now to be reformed. Germany in particular is calling for strict rules. The enr spoke with German Finance Minister Christian Lindner about what is at stake.The positions could not be further apart: EU countries such as Germany and the Netherlands are insisting on greater fiscal discipline while highly indebted ones fear that faster debt reduction could jeopardise their economic growth.The Union's debt and deficit rules, known as the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), set debt ceilings for the bloc's member states. Temporarily suspended due to the Covid-19 pandemic and then again until the end of this year due to the consequences of Russia's war on Ukraine, a reform of the rules is currently being negotiated in the EU.""Sound public finances are a precondition for a competitive single market and a stable monetary union. This is why Germany is advocating ambitious efforts to reform the Stability and Growth Pact,"" German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told the European Newsroom (enr) in a video conference interview.European Commissionâ€™s reform proposal met with criticism from GermanyIn proposals presented in mid-April, the European Commission had suggested granting highly indebted countries more flexibility in reducing debts and deficits. It does not foresee a universal rule on the speed of debt reduction that would apply to all member states. But Germany is calling for countries with excessive debt to be obliged to reduce it by at least one percent each year. ""The European Commission's proposal is not yet a landing zone and has to be improved because so far it is not guaranteed that we will see a realistic and reliable decrease in debt and deficit levels,"" said Lindner.While other partners reject a fixed cut, Lindner, leader of the liberal Free Democratic Party that governs in coalition with the Social Democrats and Greens in Germany, argued that the 1 percent reduction in normal economic times ""is not overly ambitious"" and said he was open to introducing a safeguard clause (which would allow deviations from fiscal targets) for times of crisis in order to ""address the concerns"" of other countries about this idea.Although Lindner insisted that Berlin was willing to ""discuss room for improvement"" in the Brussels proposal, he was sceptical about the possibility of introducing exceptions in the deficit calculation for certain investments, for example in defence, as some countries are calling for.""We have to maintain a high level of public sector investment on the one hand. On the other hand, there is no realistic alternative to reducing deficits and debt ratios. Too high public debt would harm our economic development and the reliability of the euro as our common currency,"" he said.Several member states have far higher debt than the permitted 60 percent of GDP. Greece is in the lead, with public debt of over 189 percent of GDP, followed by Italy (152.6 percent) and Portugal (127 percent).Germany isolated?Germanyâ€™s finance minister also denied that his country was isolated in the negotiations and said other countries had concerns about the Brussels proposal even though they might not be voicing them loudly.""Others might be less vocal but there are many member states who share our views on the importance of maintaining the stability and credibility of the fiscal rules,"" said the minister, adding that he was convinced that an agreement would be reached on one of the most divisive issues in the EU.Croatian Finance Minister Marko Primorac, for example, said his country could live with the current rules, because according to government projections, public debt will fall to below 60 percent of GDP already next year. At the same time, he said Croatia was ready to support any improvement in terms of increasing the transparency and simplicity of the rules. The Croatian government expects the debt-to-GDP ratio to fall to 62.6 percent this year and even to 55.6 percent by the end of 2026.Review of EUâ€™s long-term budgetThis year, the EU will review the Multiannual Financial Framework, the seven-year EU budget. Lindner said he expected the Commission to ask for additional funds, partly because of the high level of assistance to Ukraine.He said he opposed an increase in the European budget that would be borne by member states and instead proposed redistributing existing funds.""Before increasing the contributions of the member states, additional financial needs should be covered by reallocations or by using the existing flexibilities in the EU budget for unforeseen events. Therefore, we do not see the need to introduce new additional funds,"" he said.Lindner also said that he was not in favour of creating a new instrument like the Next Generation EU to issue joint bonds, for example, because the existing funds had not been used yet. As for aid for the reconstruction of Ukraine, he said this was a separate discussion that should involve international financial institutions such as the IMF, multilateral development banks and the G7.Curb inflation as quickly as possibleThe German minister said high inflation was a problem for national budgets and for the financial instruments of the European Union. ""This is why we have the responsibility to reduce inflation as fast as possible. If we counteract monetary policy by our fiscal policies with higher expenditures, for example, then the process of fighting inflation would last longer and would harm our economies more deeply,"" said Lindner.Referring to the idea of exempting increased defence spending needs from the calculation of the deficit, which is advocated by some countries, he said: ""Why am I so sceptical? Simply because capital markets do not distinguish between motives for making debt. For the capital markets, debt is debt and too high debt leads to instability. It is potentially fuelling inflation and reduces the sustainability of our public finances.""Italy the only country that has not ratified the ESMRegarding the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) bailout fund, Lindner said he expected Italy to ratify its reform ""in a quite short period of timeâ€ and after an â€œexchange of views on the future developments in the next years.""""I think the Italian government has posed a number of questions, and ESM director Pierre Gramegna will certainly be able to answer them all. I am convinced that we will find common ground,"" Lindner told the enr.Italy is the only country not to have ratified the reform of the ESM, with the government arguing that the mechanism should also be used for purposes other than bailouts, for example to promote investment and growth.Consensus by the end of the year?From July onwards, Spain will take over the presidency of the European Council and the countryâ€™s vice-president, Nadia CalviÃ±o, will lead the negotiations in the Council of EU economy and finance ministers.""It is difficult to reach a consensus, but if anyone is capable of uniting us all, it is Nadia CalviÃ±o. She has our support and we will be constructive throughout the process"", said Lindner, adding that he was convinced the Spanish vice-president ""will make an effort"" to forge this agreement despite the ""very specific domestic circumstances,"" a reference to the Spanish general election in July.If no agreement was reached, the current rules should be applied again from 2024, Lindner said, ""until there are new ones,"" despite the fact that these rules would require fiscal adjustments for half of the EU-27, including Germany, for exceeding the thresholds of three percent of GDP for the budget deficit or 60 percent for the public debt, according to the latest Commission forecasts.Lindner said Germany was doing its best to reach ""a consensus this year, but it has to be the best solution and not the fastest one."" Germany was prepared to negotiate day and night and through weekends and holidays if necessary to get a consensus by end-2023, he said.This Friday, the EU finance ministers meet in Luxembourg, and the discussion on debt rules is on the agenda.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: ramping up EU emissions reduction targets,"An independent advisory body on climate change calls for the EU to reduce emissions by 90% to 95% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels. The European Commission says Google may have abused its dominant position in the market. Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo warns against depriving Hungary of the rotating EU presidency.EU climate advisory body sets ambitious new emissions reduction goalBrussels (dpa) – An independent body advising the European Union on climate change on Thursday recommended the introduction of an ambitious climate target for 2040.The European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change, which was established by the European Climate Law in 2021, called for the bloc to reduce emissions by 90% to 95% by 2040, compared to 1990 levels.This reduction is crucial to mitigating climate risks and achieving a sustainable future, the board said as it launched a new report in Strasbourg on Thursday.""The advisory board's recommendations underscore the need for bold and transformative actions to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in a way that is both fair and feasible,"" said Ottmar Edenhofer, a German economist who chairs the board.""Establishing a policy framework that incentivises emissions reductions while also incentivising rapid scale-up of carbon removal is a key challenge for policymakers in the months to come,"" he added.The EU has committed to becoming climate neutral by 2050. To achieve this, emissions are to be reduced by at least 55% below 1990 levels as early as 2030.If that goal can be reached, the researchers' recommended target of 2040 could also be achieved, the board said.To do that, it said, it was important to use much more wind and solar energy, and to expand the use of fuels such as hydrogen as an alternative to fossil fuels.Online advertising: Brussels targets Google for abuse of dominant positionBrussels (AFP) – Already being sued in the United States for its ""monopoly"" in the online advertising market, Google is now under threat from Brussels, which is also considering forcing it to divest activities in this lucrative sector.On Wednesday, the European Commission took the ""preliminary view"" that Google had ""abused its dominant position"" in display advertising technologies.Google could face a colossal new fine, in addition to a forced break-up. The company has already been fined a total of â‚¬8 billion in the European Union for various anti-competitive practices.After investigation, ""we found that Google may have abused its dominant position by favouring its own ad tech services,"" European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager told the press.Google's Vice President for Global Ads, Dan Taylor, replied in a press release: â€œWe do not agree with the European Commission's view and will respond accordingly.â€  (14 June 2023)Belgian prime minister De Croo: stripping Hungary of EU presidency 'not a good idea'Brussels (Belga) – Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo is not in favour of stripping Hungary of its European Union presidency. He fears such a decision would be counterproductive, even putting the country in a â€œprivileged position.â€Belgium is to take over the Council presidency for the first half of 2024 and Hungary is due to follow in the second half. Opposition to Hungaryâ€™s presidency has emerged in the European Parliament. In a resolution, MEPs recently denounced the total lack of respect for the rule of law shown by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government. The parliament also said it had no confidence in the Hungarian presidency and asked member states to find a ""solution"" to it.Speaking in the Belgian parliament on Tuesday, Prime Minister De Croo said he shared the European Parliament's concerns about the state of the rule of law in Hungary. ""Our country has always been clear about this from the governmentâ€™s perspective,"" he said.But depriving Budapest of the presidency ""is absolutely not a good idea,"" De Croo continued. ""In my view, it would be counterproductive. The presidency is not only a privilege, but it is also a duty. It obliges a member state to show colours, play its role as president and be a mediator,"" the prime minister said. Depriving it of that duty ""would even put Hungary in a privileged position.â€Sofia reacts sharply to Russian ambassador's statements on UkraineSofia (BTA) – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry has objected to statements made by the Russian ambassador in Sofia, Eleonora Mitrofanova, on Facebook. Mitrofanova said that Bulgaria was being ""drawn into the conflict in Ukraine by supplying the Kyiv regime with ammunition or by possibly sending a national contingent to the war zone.""Attempts at disinformation regarding Bulgaria's support for Ukraine were unacceptable, the ministry said in a statement.The Republic of Bulgaria strongly condemned the unprecedented and unprovoked military aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine and was contributing to international efforts to support the country, the statement added.â€œWe are consistent in our position of solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and in our unconditional support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country within its internationally recognised borders, including territorial waters,â€ the statement added. â€œAny attempts at propaganda and disinformation that compromise democratic values are unacceptable.â€Bulgarian Minister of Defence Todor Tagarev said it was necessary to continue providing assistance to Ukraine. He ruled out sending Bulgarian military forces the to the territory of Ukraine. (June 13)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

EU does not advise pregnant women against Covid-19 vaccines,"Social media posts have misrepresented a statement from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) to claim that Covid-19 vaccination could affect female fertility. This interpretation is incorrect, according to experts. There is no evidence that the vaccines have a harmful effect on fertility. Instead, it is true that coronavirus infection increases the risk of complications.""BREAKING: The European Union is now advising against pregnant women getting the COVID vaccine,"" said a May 31, 2023 tweet. It was shared on Facebook, Instagram, and Telegram in English and French.Another May 31 tweet that spread as a screenshot to Instagram declared: ""BREAKING: The European Union is now warning pregnant women not to get the COVID-19 vaccine due to the possibility of infertility and miscarriage.""Screenshot of a Tweet taken on June 7, 2023Screenshot of an Instagram post taken June 7, 2023It was sent from an account that is no longer active, but archived versions show its profile described the person behind the tweets as the ""Founder of Leading Report.""The account posted a thread claiming its evidence came from an October 2022 EMA press release (archived here) stating ""heavy menstrual bleeding should be added to the product information as a side effect of unknown frequency of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty (Pfizer) and Spikevax (Moderna).""Similar claims were made in a May 30, 2023 article published by The Expose, a website AFP has repeatedly fact-checked for spreading vaccine misinformation.But the EMA called these claims a ""deliberate disinformation campaign,"" in a statement emailed to AFP on June 2, 2023.""These allegations are a misinterpretation of the decision of EMA's safety committee (PRAC) to add heavy menstrual bleeding as a side effect,"" the statement said. ""The committee specified, in the communication issued at the time of the recommendation, that there is no evidence or plausible mechanism to suggest that menstrual changes experienced by some women following vaccination have any impact on fertility.""The EMA confirmed it has not changed its guidance advising those who are pregnant to get vaccinated in line with national recommendations.Similarly, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada recommends Covid-19 vaccination to protect during pregnancy, as does the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.AFP also contacted the European Commission, which said it has not advised against vaccination for pregnant women.""The Commission invites everyone to follow the recommendations of the EMA,"" a spokesperson said on June 6.Vaccines offer protectionThe safety of vaccination during pregnancy is a topic AFP has fact-checked multiple times, with independent experts saying all available data confirm the shots reduce the risk of serious complications, including miscarriage.""We have data on thousands of pregnant women who have received these vaccines and there is no indication that Covid vaccination is linked to miscarriages,"" Nicolas Dauby, an infectious disease specialist at CHU Saint-Pierre hospital in Brussels.On the contrary, ""we know that the Covid vaccination is safe for the mother and the baby, while a Covid infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of giving birth prematurely,"" he said on June 2.A meta-analysis published in October 2022 concluded: ""Based on the studies published so far, there is no scientific proof of any association between Covid-19 vaccines and fertility impairment in men or women.""Additional misinformationThe Expose article also claimed ""confidential Pfizer documents"" show the Covid-19 vaccine can be shed, endangering pregnant women.As AFP has previously reported, this theory is unfounded.The CDC says on its website: ""Vaccine shedding is the release or discharge of any of the vaccine components in or outside of the body and can only occur when a vaccine contains a live weakened version of the virus.""This is not the case for any of the Covid-19 shots authorized in the US and Canada.While the mRNA vaccines introduce a ""blueprint"" of the virus's spike protein, which the body can then recognize and fight off if infected, these are not released when a person gets the shot.The article also misleads in how it presents data from the US's Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), claiming the database shows numerous fetal deaths linked to Covid-19 vaccination.Health care providers are required to report any death that occurs following Covid-19 vaccination, even if there is no indication the shot was the cause. Additional investigation by the CDC and US Food and Drug Administration is required to definitively link any death to the jab.The database website says: ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness.""More of AFP's reporting on vaccine misinformation is available here.Marie GenriesAll articlesAFP BelgiumAll articlesAFP CanadaAll articlesTranslated byMarisha GoldhamerAll articlesVACCINES COVID-19Facebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU ambassadors set renewable energy targets,"Member states reach an agreement on renewable energy consumption targets. EU finance ministers call for tough reform of EU rules on reducing government debt. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wraps up her tour of Latin America.France welcomes agreement on renewable energy consumptionParis (AFP) – On Saturday, one day after a meeting of EU ambassadors, France welcomed a European agreement on the Renewable Energy Directive that ""corresponds to the expectations"" of Paris.""I welcome the European agreement we have reached on the Renewable Energy Directive: it meets France's expectations,"" said French Minister for Energy Transition, AgnÃ¨s Pannier-Runacher, in a statement to the press.This diplomatic agreement, negotiated within Coreper, the body bringing together the EU's ambassadors in Brussels, confirms ""a target of 42.5 percent renewable energies"" in Europe's energy consumption by 2030.With this target, Europe was ""giving visibility to investors and positioning itself as a leader in the energy transition to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050,"" Pannier-Runacher said.Another point crucial for France was that the agreement ""recognises the role of nuclear power"" in achieving Europe's decarbonisation targets, Pannier-Runacher added. (17 June)Debate on EU debt rules: France calls for country autonomyLuxembourg (dpa) – In the debate on a reform of the EUâ€™s debt rules, France continues to oppose the uniform rules for all countries demanded by Germany, among others. ""Our answer is clearly 'no', for reasons that stem from our past experience,"" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said at a meeting of EU finance ministers in Luxembourg on Friday. ""I remind you that the European Union is still built on the sovereignty of nations and states,"" Le Maire said.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner, on the other hand, reiterated his call for uniform rules. ""We need common rules that are the same for everyone,"" he said in Luxembourg. Fiscal rules should not become ""softer in principle, but more realistic and reliable."" Another ten – mainly Eastern European – countries had sided with Germany in a guest article in German daily Die Welt on Thursday. They also spoke out in favour of ""clear and comprehensible rules that apply equally to all member states.""Currently, the EU is negotiating a reform of its debt rules. The rules prescribe upper limits for the states. In essence, they provide for debt to be limited to a maximum of 60 percent of economic output and for budget deficits to be kept below 3 percent. Due to the Covid-19 crisis and the fallout from Russiaâ€™s attack on Ukraine, the previously applicable rules have been suspended until 2024. States normally have to repay 5 percent of the debt above the 60-percent mark in a year. For highly indebted countries like Italy or Greece, this would be devastating for growth. Even before the pandemic, the rules were disregarded, also by Germany.In reform proposals for the so-called Stability and Growth Pact presented in mid-April, the EU Commission had suggested giving highly indebted countries more flexibility in reducing debts and deficits. Instead of uniform requirements for all countries, the authority relies on individual ways for each country to reduce debts and deficits in the long term. From Germany's point of view, the proposals are not sufficient; Finance Minister Lindner demands strict minimum requirements. For example, countries with high debt ratios should have to reduce them by at least one percentage point per annum. (16 June)Von der Leyen closes Mexico tour with focus on trade and Ukraine warMexico City (EFE) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen concluded her Latin American tour in Mexico on Thursday. During the tour she had sought to boost trade agreements with Mercosur and Mexico, warned of global disruptions caused by Russia's war in Ukraine and highlighted the EUâ€™s strong sustainable investment package in the region.""Global challenges such as Russia's war on Ukraine, the fight against climate change, extreme poverty and the global race for technology are pushing the EU to strengthen ties with historic partners. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean are partners by choice,"" von der Leyen said in an interview with EFE in Mexico.The last stop, in Mexico City, was the only one where no statements were made to the media.

The Spanish EU Presidency: Leading the EU Council in the run-up to elections,"Ahead of Spainâ€™s EU Presidency, the countryâ€™s Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez called for European unity ahead of the elections next year. The socialist wants to lead Europe through crises and aims to settle the major issues by the end of this year: the European migration pact, the debt rules and reducing the bloc's dependence on third countries, among other topics. The national snap elections in July could spoil that.Spainâ€™s EU presidency, which it takes over from Sweden on 1 July, comes in times of crisis. Moreover, it will be the last full presidency before the European elections in the spring of 2024. A time that is usually used to close many issues before the polls. As Spain faces snap elections on 23 July, and surveys are suggesting a possible right-wing government, there is the question of how that could impact policy-making in Brussels in the second half of 2023.Reindustrialization, green transition, strengthening social justice and EU unity are the four priorities on the agenda of Spain's presidency. ""We will promote the reindustrialization and digitalization of Europe. We will make decisive progress in the ecological transition. We will make the economy more prosperous, but also fairer, and we will strengthen European unity with new tools and new agreements,"" said Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez last week in Madrid, presenting the program of the presidency.In addition to the four priorities, SÃ¡nchez said he hoped to close the EUâ€™s New Pact on Migration and Asylum. The Council and the European Parliament will now have to reach a consensus, which Spain had advocated in order to achieve the relocation of migrants. ""We have always said that the EU cannot be divided, we are all victims of these crises. Spain has always said that we must strengthen the external dimension of the phenomenon, strengthen cooperation with the countries of transit and origin,"" concluded SÃ¡nchez.Another major objective proposed by SÃ¡nchez will be the creation of minimum corporate taxation throughout the EU in order to put an end ""once and for all to tax evasion by large fortunes and large corporations."" According to Spainâ€™s prime minister, tax evasion costs the European Union 1.5 percentage points of its annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the same amount, he said, that is invested in subsidised housing and the environment.Further key topics for Spainâ€™s EU Presidency will be the reform of the energy market, the review of the fiscal rules in the Stability and Growth Pact and continued support for Ukraine.Snap elections in SpainSpainâ€™s Prime Minister himself has played down the national elections happening during his countryâ€™s presidency of the Council of the European Union. ""It is not the first time that elections are held during the rotating presidency, there have also been changes of governments during the presidency,"" said SÃ¡nchez.In view of the opinion polls that suggest a future right-wing government in Spain, SÃ¡nchez has recalled that the role of his government ""is not to impose European dossiers or debates, but to guide the existing ones before the end of the six-month period.""Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez had called the snap elections on 23 July after his Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) suffered a heavy defeat in local elections in May. This is the second government of SÃ¡nchez, who has been Prime Minister since 2018.Geopolitical opportunities: EU and Latin AmericaPedro SÃ¡nchez wants to strengthen ties with Latin America. The Spanish government considers that, in recent times, the EU has turned its back on Latin America, despite the fact that both regions share values and principles. As pointed out at the Ibero-American Summit this year, Latin America also sees Spain's presidency of the EU as an opportunity for closer ties.Spain will also propose a strategy to guarantee the EU's economic security and global leadership until 2030. It aims to promote dossiers to foster the development of strategic industries and technologies in Europe and diversify trade relations, with a special focus on Latin America. The EU-CELAC Summit is planned to be held in Brussels in July and intends to conclude the pending trade agreements with Mercosur, Chile and Mexico.In addition, the Spanish presidency announced that it will work to attract new companies to Europe amidst geopolitical, technological and environmental changes, which it sees as an opportunity to reduce the EU's excessive dependence on third countries in areas such as energy, health, digital technology and food.Bulgaria: Schengen stays the top priorityHowever, there are more issues to be solved during the 6-month presidency. The Schengen accession continues to be one of Bulgariaâ€™s top priorities. Sofia hopes the Spanish Presidency will schedule a new vote no later than October. Last December, such a vote failed during the Czech Presidency, as Austria and the Netherlands blocked Romaniaâ€™s and Bulgariaâ€™s accession to the Schengen area.Since then, Sofia has received EU support to strengthen its external borders and adopted long-awaited law reforms concerning the judiciary and rule of law. Therefore, Sofia hopes that the upcoming European Commission Rule of Law report, set to be published in July, could give additional momentum to the Schengen enlargement.Bulgaria's new Deputy Prime Minister, soon-to-be head of government and former European Commissioner, Mariya Gabriel, told reporters earlier this week that she was optimistic the report would be positive and she expected the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for Bulgaria, introduced in 2007, to finally be lifted.EU Enlargement in the Western BalkansOn a visit to Slovenia in mid-February, SÃ¡nchez and the Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob underlined their support for Ukraine as well as the importance of tackling energy challenges and a united European response to migration. They also discussed the EU's enlargement policy, with a focus on the Western Balkans. The prime ministers stressed the importance of Europe's strategic autonomy, which will be one of the priorities of the Spanish EU Presidency.""We expect the issue of EU enlargement to be on the agenda of the Spanish presidency. We support the decision to grant candidate status for EU membership to Ukraine and Moldova, but we also expect the Western Balkans region to retain a central place in EU enlargement policy,â€ said MiloÅ¡ TodoroviÄ‡ from Serbiaâ€™s Foreign Ministry, adding that Serbia welcomes the Spanish presidency and hopes for further progress in the accession negotiations.Presidential trioThe Spanish presidency will kick off the new trio, also comprising Belgium and Hungary, which will preside in the first and second half of 2024, respectively. The presidential trio defines long-term goals and prepares a joint program of the main topics and issues that the Council will deal with in a period of 18 months. Based on that program, all three countries are preparing their detailed six-month programs.This is the fifth presidency of Spain since the country became a member in 1986. It presided for the first time in 1989, and again in 1995, 2002 and 2010.In the second half of this year, Spain will organize 21 informal meetings on its soil, each of them in a different city. A meeting of EU heads of state or government is scheduled for October in Granada.It remains to be seen how the snap elections on 23 July turn out, and whether Prime Minister SÃ¡nchez will be able to lead Europe through these crucial six months to close the dossiers ahead of the European elections.Editor's note: This article has been edited.

Europe in brief: EU supports Serbia's energy market,"The EU is helping Serbia to ensure the secure supply and transport of energy products. According to the latest Global Gender Gap report, Slovakia moved up four places on the World Economic Forumâ€™s gender equality ranking. EU environment ministers agree on a â€œgeneral approachâ€ regarding the controversial Nature Restoration Law.ÄedoviÄ‡: The EU is helping Serbia to ensure a safe supply of energyBelgrade (Tanjug) – Serbian Minister of Mining and Energy Dubravka ÄedoviÄ‡ said that the EU was helping Serbia with grants and low-interest loans to ensure the secure supply and transport of energy products, as well as the diversification of gas supply. ""Serbia has become part of the European energy market together with the countries of the region in 2006, long before it received the status of a candidate for EU membership,"" said ÄedoviÄ‡, speaking on the panel at the beginning of the ""European Week of Opportunities"", organized by the EU Delegation in Serbia.She said that the connected market reduced the risks of shortages and rising prices of energy products. ""The crisis showed that the countries that were better connected to their neighbours through cross-border interconnections and in the gas and electricity sectors were less affected by energy price increases,"" ÄedoviÄ‡ stated.She added that Serbia was already well-connected, but that it was now working on even better connections with its neighbours. â€œHaving better access to the gas and energy exchange market helps you reduce costs and risk. Our partners from the EU are helping us with financial aid,"" said ÄedoviÄ‡. The minister pointed out that with the help of EU funds, Serbia was currently building a gas interconnector with Bulgaria, and that with the completion of this project, the country would get an additional source of gas supply. ""As last yearâ€™s crisis showed, EU countries are trying to diversify their sources, and we recognized that as well. With the completion of this project, the conditions will be created for us to have another source of gas supply,"" ÄedoviÄ‡ pointed out.She also emphasised that a power interconnector with Romania was under construction and that investments were being made in the electricity transmission system in Serbia, in order to ensure better conditions for the transport of electricity. She pointed out that at the Council for Strategic Cooperation with Hungary, there was talk of an additional connection via the Pannonian Corridor, which the EU also recognized as important.ÄedoviÄ‡ added that these were strategic projects of great value, essential for ensuring energy security. ""In cooperation with the EU, we want to work on the decarbonization of electricity production, and it is very important for us to carefully plan the transition to green energy, because we produce almost 60 percent of our electricity using coal,"" concluded ÄedoviÄ‡. (June 21)WEF: Slovakia ranked 63rd in gender equalityCologny (TASR) – Slovakia ranks 63rd in the Global Gender Gap report prepared by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Compared to last year, the country has improved by four places.In the survey on political equality between men and women, which examines the number of women in ministerial positions or in legislatures, Slovakia ranks 80th. The Slovak Republic improved its ranking on the issue of equal pay for equal work for men and women, jumping from 102nd to 86th place.Iceland topped the list, followed by Norway, Finland, New Zealand and Sweden. Germany, Nicaragua, Namibia, Lithuania and Belgium ranked sixth to tenth.Countries that have slipped in the gender equality rankings include Switzerland, from 13th to 21st, and Austria, from 21st to 47th. Austria's fall was mainly due to the low number of women in ministerial positions.The WEF notes that although gender equality has returned to pre-pandemic levels, overall progress in this area has slowed significantly. The WEF calculates that at the current rate, full gender equality in the world will take another 131 years to achieve. (21 June)EU environment ministers find common position on Nature Restoration LawLuxembourg (APA) – The EU Council of Environment Ministers reached a ""general approach"" on the EUâ€™s controversial Nature Restoration Law in Luxembourg on Tuesday.The European Commission's proposal is intended to ensure more biodiversity. The law was of great importance, Austria's Environment Minister Leonore Gewessler said after the agreement. She supported the objectives of the draft, but abstained from the vote. The reason she gave was the distribution of competences in nature conservation in Austria.""This text is a solid basis for negotiations with the European Parliament,"" said Romina Pourmokhtari, Swedish Minister for Climate and Environment and current representative of the Council Presidency. ""Today is a good day for nature.""""We must now try to get a majority in the European Parliament. This is not guaranteed, but it is possible,"" stressed Frans Timmermans, European Commission Vice-President in charge of the Green Deal. He hoped that the law would be ""finalised by the end of the year."" It was essential now, he said, was to talk about the content of the proposal, not simply to reject it. ""We have to overcome party political differences. We must not create a left-right dynamic,"" the Dutch Social Democrat said. He explained that â€œmany of those who voted in favour today come from the EPP family,â€ the group representing the Christian Democrats in the European Parliament, which had so far been particularly critical of the Nature Restoration Law. â€œThis goes beyond party political boundaries,"" Timmermans said.The proposal aims to introduce restoration measures covering at least 20 percent of the EU's land and marine areas by 2030, and all ecosystems in need of ""restoration"" by 2050. The ministers made numerous changes to the original Commission proposal.The goal of increased biodiversity had to be taken seriously, said Gewessler. The agreed proposal preserved the substance, but allowed for a more practicable implementation, she added. An extensive network of deadlines for the implementation and monitoring of the measures was taking that into account. ""It is important that a broadly supported signal goes out from the Council today. I assume that the next step will be taken in Parliament next week,"" Gewessler told journalists.A large majority of 20 member states has agreed. According to Gewessler, the forthcoming Spanish Presidency is ready and wants to bring the dossier to a conclusion.The ""general approach"" serves as a mandate for negotiations with the European Parliament on the final shape of the legislation. Numerous EPP MEPs are demanding the EU Commission to submit a new proposal. The eagerly awaited vote in the Environment Committee had been postponed to 27 June after hours of tight wrangling over amendments. (June 20)Brussels asks EU-27 for additional 66 billion for Ukraine, migration and clean technologiesBrussels (EFE) – The European Commission has asked member states for 65.8 billion euros in new national contributions to the EU budget to finance the bloc's main ""political priorities"" until 2027, including continued support for Ukraine, migration management and investment in clean technology.The main novelty of the review will be the 50-billion-euro package that Brussels is proposing to dedicate to continued support for Ukraine from 2024 until 2027. But the EU is also proposing to allocate 15 billion euros to strengthen the blocâ€™s migration policy, both internally and externally, through dialogue and agreements with third countries.Brussels is also proposing the creation of the Strategic Technology Platform for Europe (STEP), endowed with 10 billion euros, with the aim of channelling investment into sectors such as clean technologies or biotechnology, in order to boost the bloc's competitiveness in the face of the strength of other powers such as China or the United States.

EU chief's salary not up by 15% in 2024 draft budget,"European officials received a salary increase of 1.7 percent in June. Yet, viral social media posts claim that that was just the beginning and that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has demanded a 15-percent increase for herself and other EU staff. These claims are false. The EU budget plan for 2024 does not mention such an increase. Salary increases for EU staff and the Commission president are automatically calculated according to strict rules that depend on the inflation level in Brussels and Luxembourg and the change in purchasing power of civil servants in the member states. ""Incredible: Ursula demands a pay raise of 15 percent! 4,700 euros a month more! Following a salary increase of 8 percent already in January. Ditto for EU officials. Meanwhile, inflation and austerity for the people,"" far-right French politician Florian Philippot said in a Facebook post which was shared nearly 800 times.""Ursula von der Leyen, who has plunged the working class into the doldrums, is demanding a salary increase of 15%! Total indecency,"" said one internet user in a tweet with nearly 600 likes. These claims have also been circulating on German and Dutch social media. Screenshot taken on Twitter on June 16, 2023Most of the posts share an article published on June 12, 2023 by the Austrian online news portal eXXpress. ""What can be read in the budget plan of the European Union for 2024, which has just been exposed, will make many Austrians and Germans really angry: while workers in these countries... have to bear the enormous burden on their families of the still brutal inflation, the 50,000 EU employees want to treat themselves to a 15-percent increase on their monthly renumeration,"" the article said. Regarding the president of the European Commission, eXXpress added: ""following the recent seven percent salary increase, von der Leyen now collects 31,250 euros gross per month. Starting this coming year, this will become 35,957.50 euros -- so she will receive 4,687.50 euros more per month!""""These articles are false and misleading,"" the European Commission's representation in Austria said in a statement published on June 15. While the EU budget plan for 2024 does include figures for salary increases for EU officials and members of the Commission, the 15-percent figure does not appear anywhere in the document. What's more, these increases do not stem from demands made by von der Leyen, but are automatic updates whose calculation method is precisely defined by EU rules.EU draft budget for 2024The European Commission on June 7 proposed an EU budget of 189.3 billion euros for 2024. The budget still must be negotiated and  approved by the member states and the European Parliament in the months to come. The draft budget is available on the European Union's website. It details the estimated budget of every European institution for 2024, and notably that of the European Commission. ""High inflation and rising energy prices continue to create substantial pressure on administrative expenditure. The Commission has again carefully assessed the budget request for its own administrative appropriations for 2024 and sought to offset any necessary increases by reprioritisation and reductions in all possible areas,"" the draft budget said.Regarding the Commission's expenditure for staff renumeration, the budget mentions a 4.7-percent increase that mainly results from ""the estimated annual salary update as of 1 July 2023 (+4.4%) and as of 1 July 2024 (+3.4% on a six-month basis)"". Excerpt from the European Commission's budget plan for 2024, screenshot from June 16, 2023The draft budget is accompanied by a series of annexes or ""working documents"". The sixth one addresses administrative expenditures of EU institutions. It includes estimated salary increases for members of the European Commission, including its president, von der Leyen.The document specifies the calculation method for the salaries of Commission members. For the president, her salary is equivalent to 138 percent of the basic salary of a grade AD 16/3 civil servant on 01/07/2022 -- which was 22,646.29 euros -- or 31,252 euros. This figure corresponds to what the eXXpress article said was von der Leyen's current gross salary. Excerpt from the European Commission's working document VI on the budget plan for 2024, screenshot from June 16, 2023A table summarises the increase provisioned for the coming year. As is the case for other Commission employees, the anticipated salary increase for von der Leyen is 4.4 percent. The table also mentions a potential update of 3.4 percent on July 1, 2024 for von der Leyen, as well as for other Commission employees. Nowhere does the document mention a 15-percent salary increase, be it for von der Leyen or for any other employee of the European Union.What's more, the increases mentioned in the draft budget have not been adopted. They are but estimates. These figures aim ""to anticipate possible budgetary needs. This does not mean that this amount will be paid to EU staff. What will be paid, will be the amount that will be calculated by Eurostat (the EU's statistical agency) based on the evolution of national civil servants purchasing power,"", the Commission's press office told AFP on June 19.Â Automatic increasesThe salary of the European Commission president is not set according to the wishes of the person in the position but abides by rules established in 1967. As mentioned in the draft budget, that amount corresponds to 138 percent of the salary of a civil servant who has reached the highest level and grade on the grid.As for its annual change, that too abides by rules. They apply to EU officials, MEPs and judges of The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).""The salary update is based on a 2013 decision by the European Parliament and member states in the Council, which decided on a pre-set system of calculating salary adjustments for EU institutions,"" a spokesperson for the European Commission told AFP.Â The evolution of wages of EU officials depends on two factors: the change in inflation and the change in purchasing power -- whether upwards or downwards -- of civil servants in the member states. Ursula von der Leyen in Slovakia in May 2023 ( AFP / MICHAL CIZEK)""The exact figure of the update is calculated by Eurostat based on the evolution of national civil servants' net purchasing power over the period of July of the previous year to July of the current year as well as the evolution of inflation in Brussels and Luxembourg... In other words, if salaries of public officials in our member states increase or decrease on average, so do those of EU officials. If during the first half of the reference period high inflation is oberved, an intermediate update is foreseen,"" the spokesperson explained. In concrete terms, the salaries and pensions of EU staff (including those of the Commission president) are automatically updated once a year (on the December pay slip). Exceptionally, when inflation is very high (above three percent during the first half of the reference period), there is an automatic intermediate update in the middle of the year (normally along with the June pay slip).""That is the case this year. The intermediate update is 1.7 percent and was paid to staff with the June payslip, retroactively since January 2023. In December 2023, there will be a final automatic annual update, reflecting the final evolution of purchasing power of national civil servants. This annual automatic update takes into account what was paid  in the June intermediate update,"", the European Commission's press office said.Â ""Because the final evolution (of purchasing power) of national civil servants between July 2022 and July 2023 is not known yet, it is not possible to know what the automatic 2023 annual update will be... This is also true for the 2024 annual update,"", it added. Â That is also what the Union Syndicale Federale (USF) -- which represents European public service employees -- explains on its website. Between July and December 2022, inflation in Brussels and Luxembourg increased by 3.7 percent according to Eurostat figures. But at the same time, the purchasing power of national civil servants fell, resulting in an intermediate update for EU officials of 1.7 percent. ""As inflation slows down, it is too early to try to predict the likely level of the annual update, but it is important to note that the 1.7 percent update that we will already have received mid-year will of course be deducted from the method's annual result,"" the union said. For the salary of EU officials and von der Leyen to grow by 15 percent at a time when inflation is slowing in Belgium and Luxembourg (to a respective 2.7 percent and 2 percent in May according to Eurostat), that would require the purchasing power of civil servants in member states to improve very considerably. European flags in front of the European Commission headquarters in Brussels in 2022 ( AFP / KENZO TRIBOUILLARD)A 4.5-percent increase in 2022 plus an adjustmentMany of the social media posts that we looked at claim that EU officials and von der Leyen already received a salary increase of seven percent in 2022. The figure is correct, but the increase is in fact a result of an exceptional adjustment. From July 2021 to June 2022, inflation in Brussels and Luxembourg rose by 8.6 percent. But during that same period, the purchasing power of national civil servants decreased by 3.9 percent. The net increase of EU staff renumeration was thus 4.5 percent for the year, after taking into account an intermediate increase of 2.4 percent as a result of high inflation, the USF explained. Added to that increase was a ""2.5-percent salary increase that was not applied in 2020 due to the economic crisis"", according to the USF. This gives a total seven-percent increase. ""The 2.5-percent increase was granted to national civil servants back in 2020, but was suspended for EU staff becaue of the significant decrease of the EU GDP in 2020,"" the Commission's press office told AFP. In 2022, this increase was unblocked because the EU GDP had reached its pre-crisis level from 2019.Â This freezing mechanism was also explained in 2021 by the Union for Unity, another union representing EU staff. It said on its website that the 2.5-percent increase had not be awarded because of the exception clause, since the EU's GDP had decreased by more than three percent. It then added that the amount would be applied once the EUâ€™s GDP returned to its 2019 level. The salaries and benefits of EU staff and institution leaders are a constant subject of criticism, notably from certain member states in times of budgetary restraints (for example here, here or more recently here). They are also regular targets of misinformation, some of which AFP has previously fact-checked.BÃ©nÃ©dicte REYTous ses articlesAFP BelgiqueTous ses articlesTranslated by Anna Maria JAKUBEKFacebookÂ TwitterÂ EmailVous avez un doute sur l'authenticitÃ© d'une info, d'une citation ou d'une image ?Contactez-nous sur WhatsApp ! WhatsAppSuivez-nousAccueilA proposComment nous travaillonsRÃ¨gles Ã©ditoriales et Ã©thiquesNotre Ã©quipeManuel du fact-checkingFormationsObjectif DesinfoxContactCorrectionsAbonnement pour les prosMentions lÃ©galesFactuelCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Flanders wants to postpone debate on 2040 CO2 cuts,"The Flemish government calls on the European Commission to focus on meeting the 2030 CO2 reduction targets before discussing goals for 2040. Kyriakos Mitsotakis wins Greek elections by a landslide. Austria and Italy join forces to fight illegal migration and reshape EU migration and asylum policies.Flanders wants discussion on 2040 CO2 targets postponedBrussels (Belga) – According to the Flemish Minister for Energy and Environment, Zuhal Demir, the Flemish government has asked the European Commission to postpone the discussion on CO2 reduction targets for 2040. The minister asks to focus, for the time being, ""on the huge amount of work that still needs to be done today to deliver on earlier commitments.""A public consultation on 2040 CO2 reduction targets is currently underway at European level. But according to Demir, all Flemish government parties agree that it is a bad idea to start this discussion now. Therefore, the Flemish Energy and Climate Agency sent a formal message to the European Commission on Friday, asking for a postponement.""The focus of member states in the coming years should be on achieving the already ambitious 2030 targets through concrete measures. The nature of these short-term challenges justifies, in our opinion, postponing the discussion on the 2040 target,"" the Flemish government wrote to the European Commission in a public consultation.The Flemish government believes that the European Commission's first priority should be to ""help member states to accelerate the transition away from imported fossil fuels and to ensure the availability of affordable energy by implementing the agreed dossiers.â€ Demir stressed that ""when the time is right,"" the Flemish government would contribute constructively to the discussions on setting targets for 2040. (25 June)Conservative Mitsotakis wins landslide victory in Greek parliamentary electionsAthens (EFE) – Conservative leader Kyriakos Mitsotakis won a landslide victory in Sunday's elections, breaking several historical records as the first Greek leader since 1974 – the end of dictatorship – to improve his results after one term in power.With 96.6 percent of the votes counted, Mitsotakis' conservative New Democracy (ND) had won 40.5 percent of the vote. These figures guarantee the conservatives an absolute majority with 158 of the 300 seats in the Greek parliament, compared to just 47 for the left-wing opposition Syriza, led by former prime minister Alexis Tsipras, which won just 17.8 percent of the vote.This is the first time since the fall of the military dictatorship in 1974 that a ruling party has managed to improve its results and also widen the gap to the opposition. It is also the first time since the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2010 that a Greek prime minister has been re-elected after a four-year term.

The European Council of heads of state and government will meet in Brussels on 29 and 30 June.""Europe's asylum system has failed,"" said Nehammer. ""The EU needs to move from talk to action, to actually implement asylum procedures at the external border and, above all, to go a step further and conclude strong agreements on asylum procedures in third countries outside the EU,"" he added.Meloni said she and Nehammer were pulling together to bring about a ""paradigm shift"" in the EU. She said she hoped for concrete decisions at the summit. (24 June)EU green-lights destruction of surplus wine stocksParis (AFP) – The European Commission has approved the principle of destroying surplus stocks of red and rosÃ© wine in its member states, including France and Spain, and compensating producers facing a market crisis.""Under wine national support programmes, it will now be possible for member states to include crisis distillation to remove the excess of wine from the market,"" the Commission said in a press release.This exceptional measure, which has been awaited by winegrowers for several months, should allow them to convert surplus quantities into pure alcohol for industrial use (perfume, hydroalcoholic gel, etc.).Member states will have to target the regions or types of wine most affected by the imbalance between supply and demand. In France, this will mainly concern wines from the Bordeaux region. This region has also set up a programme to dig up surplus vines.""The wine distilled is taken out of the market, and the alcohol obtained can only be used for non-food purposes to avoid a distortion of competition,"" the Commission said. (23 June 2023)Romania to become EU's largest natural gas producerBucharest (Agerpres) – The head of Romanian oil company OMV Petrom, Christina Verchere, said on Thursday that the first gas volumes from the Neptun Deep project will be produced in 2027, making Romania the largest natural gas producer in the European Union.The remarks were made during an event marking the announcement by OMV Petrom and Romgaz of the development of the Neptun Deep project, the largest natural gas project in the Romanian Black Sea region.OMV Petromâ€™s CEO said that the announcement of the final investment decision for the Neptun Deep project represented ""a new and essential chapter for the Romanian energy sector."" She noted that the project would support the country's ""energy security"" and make it a ""very important player"" in this market.""The estimated production is about 30 times the annual demand, which covers 4.3 million households. The estimated revenue for the Romanian state would be 20 billion euros. Neptun Deep is a very important step for our 2030 strategy, which aims to support the energy transition of Romania and the region,"" she added.Verchere said that there are two fields, Domino and Pelican South, at a depth of 100-1,000 metres. Ten wells will extract the natural gas, which will flow to a new offshore platform.""These facilities will be operated remotely via digital replication, which will allow for safety and process optimisation. The gas will be processed on the onshore platform and then sent through a pipeline that will be connected to the national grid,"" said Verchere.The CEO of the national gas company Romgaz, RÄƒzvan Popescu, said that the development of the Neptun Deep project was a historic decision that would bring undeniable benefits to Romania's energy security and independence.

The German Federal Statistical Office reveals that significantly more people live alone in Germany than in most other EU countries.Slovenia saw an increase in the number of cyber attacks last yearLjubljana (STA) – Slovenia recorded 4,123 cyber security incidents last year, an increase of almost a third compared to 2021, the SI-CERT National Cyber Security Response Centre (NSCRC) said in a report on cyber security. The year 2022 was marked by the war in Ukraine, which highlighted the importance of information sharing with the international community.Last year, phishing attacks again stood out among the incidents recorded, with 1,432 incidents compared to 950 the previous year. This category was again the fastest growing. In most cases, the attack vector was email, but the response centre saw a sharp rise in phishing attacks via SMS and messaging apps. ""So it is no longer just email, where very good filters on mail servers protect us from phishing, but also SMS and other private messages, where no such protection exists,"" the SI-CERT warns.In recent years, there has been a clear trend for threats to migrate to smartphones in the form of SMS messages requesting authentication details to access electronic banking under the guise of verifying data or confirming transactions, the SI-CERT stresses. (29 June)Scholz: There should be no new conditions for North Macedonia's accession negotiationsBerlin (MIA) – The accession process of North Macedonia should be regular according to what has been recorded in writing and there should be no new conditions referring to the bilateral situation between North Macedonia and Bulgaria, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said at a joint press conference with the Prime Minister of North Macedonia, Dimitar Kovacevski, who was on a two-day official visit to the Federal Republic of Germany.""Let me be clear. It is clearly agreed and should be a regular accession process under the procedures managed by the EU. These are things that are already on paper, and nothing else should come as far as the bilateral situation is concerned. I vouch for that,"" Chancellor Scholz said, when asked by a journalist whether he could accept Bulgarian President Rumen Radev's statement that the constitutional amendments laid down in the negotiating framework were only a preliminary condition for the country, and that they did not exhaust all the conditions for North Macedonia to enter the second phase of negotiations.Scholz said that the constitutional amendments were of key importance for North Macedonia's path to the EU and that Germany took the country's EU perspective seriously. (28 June)Share of people living alone in Germany well above EU averageWiesbaden (dpa) – According to statistics, significantly more people live alone in Germany than in most other countries of the European Union. The Federal Statistical Office in Wiesbaden reported on Wednesday, on the basis of data from the European statistics office Eurostat, that the share of people living alone in Germany amounted to 20.1 percent last year, well above the EU average of 15.8 percent.Only in the Scandinavian countries Finland (25.4 percent), Sweden (23.5 percent) and Denmark (23.2 percent), as well as in Lithuania (22.7 percent) and Estonia (21.8 percent), the share of people living alone was greater. By contrast, the rate was particularly low in Slovakia (3.1 percent), followed by Cyprus (8.0 percent), Poland (8.5 percent), Croatia (9.6 percent) and Portugal (9.9 percent).According to the data, women were more likely to live alone than men in most EU countries. On average, around 55 percent of people living alone in the EU last year were female. Older people were also more than twice as likely to live alone as the average population.Recently, the Federal Statistical Office had announced that the share of single-person households in Germany had more than doubled since the 1950s. (28 June)European Parliament puts the brakes on rules for restoring ecosystemsBrussels (ANSA) – There is no majority in the European Parliament's Environment Committee to approve the position on the draft regulation on the restoration of ecosystems. Just as on 15 June, there was also no majority to reject the measure in its entirety. On both occasions, the vote was tied at 44 to 44. In between, more than 2,500 amendments were scrutinised one by one and approved or rejected, often on a knife's edge.The tug-of-war will continue in plenary, in a paralysed European Parliament unable – for the first time – to decide on one of the regulations of the Green Deal, the centrepiece of the von der Leyen Commission's programme. On the one hand, the European People's Party (EPP), as well as part of the Liberals and the Right in the European Parliament, demand the withdrawal of the proposal. On the other hand, there are those on the left who would like to see the regulation go ahead. The risk of rejection is real, as parliamentarians  are navigating on sight. This also concerns the date of the showdown in Strasbourg, which could be as early as July or, according to some members of the People's Party, postponed until September.""The vote by the European Parliament's Environment Committee confirms that the reservations expressed by Italy were justified and shared,"" stressed Italian Environment Minister Gilberto Pichetto Fratin. Last week, EU ministers gave their general approach the green light by a narrow majority, with Italy and six other countries voting against. ""We are confident that after this setback the text can be significantly improved,"" Pichetto added. (27 June)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Croatia celebrates 10 years in the EU - membership remains remote for neighbouring countries,"A decade ago, Croatia became the then 28th member of the European Union. The country has achieved its strategic goals, but membership has led to a significant population outflow. In the meantime, neighbouring countries are still in the waiting room.After ten years of waiting, joining the EU on 1 July 2013 was one of the most important events in Croatian history and, together with NATO membership achieved four years earlier, the country's most important foreign policy goal since independence. However, this might have been the last EU enlargement for many years, as none of the candidate countries is close to membership.Croatiaâ€™s negotiations took longer than for any other current member state, five years and nine months. They were conditional on full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague (ICTY), which insisted on the arrest of General Ante Gotovina. The negotiations were burdened by the cooperation with the ICTY in The Hague and Slovenia's blockade due to a bilateral border dispute, as well as by enlargement fatigue in the existing member states at that time.Croatia applied for membership on 21 February 2003, official candidate status was granted on 18 June 2004, and negotiations started on 3 October 2005. The last of the negotiating chapters was closed on 30 June 2011.Great progress, but not swift enoughToday, after ten years of EU membership, many strategic goals have been achieved, among them joining the Schengen area and the eurozone, as well as Croatiaâ€™s first Presidency of the Council of the EU in the first half of 2020. Brussels also supported the country in connecting its southernmost exclave with the construction of the PeljeÅ¡ac Bridge.With a downward trend in public debts, the country has good fiscal results. The government even projects debt to drop below 60 percent next year, which is the ratio allowed under the Maastricht criteria. Nevertheless, before its accession to the EU, Croatia's economy fell into a recession that lasted more than six years. The total decline in real GDP in the period from 2009 to 2014 amounted to 12.6 percent. GDP only exceeded the 2008 level again in 2019.Another problem is the big gap between the countryâ€™s capital Zagreb, which has a GDP of 131 percent of the EU average, and the eastern counties, which have a GDP that is below 40 percent of the European average. Zagreb generated 34 percent of the national GDP in 2018, while the majority of the population (67 percent) lives in areas where GDP per capita is below 60 percent of the European average.Population outflowCroatia lost nearly 10 percent of its population due to emigration in the past decade. Better work and life conditions in richer member states, but also the labour shortage – particularly in Germany, which has more than two million job vacancies – led to a serious population outflow.However, for Croatia, there are several signs that the trend of moving and leaving the country has slowed down, but it hasnâ€™t stopped yet. The experiences of other countries show that immigration and emigration balance each other out once the level of economic development reaches about 80 percent of the EU average, Croatia is at 73 percent at the moment.Potential growth is negatively affected by population decline and low productivity, but reforms that would lead to more efficient public administration and a better judiciary would have a positive effect. To reach the European average in the foreseeable future, Croatian growth would have to be much faster than it is now. Nevertheless, the benefits of EU membership become apparent when Croatia is compared to some other former Yugoslavian countries that are doing less well economically.EU enlargement perspective for the regionAll Western Balkan countries except Kosovo have been granted candidate status: Bosnia and Herzegovina in 2022, Albania in 2014, Serbia in 2012, Montenegro in 2010 as well as North Macedonia in 2005.Although the Russian attack on Ukraine brought some changes in the enlargement policy and geopolitical aspects are again at play, it is difficult to imagine further enlargement without a reform of the decision-making process, which is already difficult with the present 27 member states.As for the countries of the Western Balkans, at the summit in Thessaloniki in 2003, the EU promised them that they would become members when they met the conditions. Twenty years later, only Croatia and Slovenia are EU members, even though Brussels continues to emphasise its commitment to enlargement and the countries of the Western Balkans emphasise that membership is their strategic goal.Recently, seven member states called for the Western Balkans' EU accession process to speed up. In a statement, the seven, led by Austria, warned that the enlargement process has been too slow and has not delivered enough tangible results for the people in the region. In light of the war in Ukraine and tensions in Kosovo, they also warned against the danger of instability in the region.Slovenia pushing for â€˜courageous political choicesâ€™Slovenia is one of the countries that strongly advocates the integration of the Western Balkan countries into the European Union. On the 20th anniversary of the EU-Western Balkans Summit in Thessaloniki, Slovenian President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar, Prime Minister Robert Golob and Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon issued a joint statement reiterating continued support for the countries of the region on their path to the EU. They recalled that many opportunities have been missed on both sides since the 2003 Summit. ""The initial enthusiasm for reform in the Western Balkans seems to have waned somewhat over the past two decades,"" they wrote. At the same time, they said, the EU was facing its own problems, and enlargement was not always a priority. ""It is clear that this process is fundamentally a strategic choice and not a technical exercise. (...) Courageous political choices are needed,â€ they stressed.The bloc is aware that it cannot leave the Western Balkans and the countries of Eastern Europe to the influence of other actors who do not share the values on which the EU is based. For this reason, there is the idea to bring the Eastern European countries closer to the EUâ€™s single market and increase pre-accession aid.Western Balkan integration is geopolitical interest of the EU â€œCroatia waited for a decade. The success of any post-Cold War membership is crucial in justifying the need for any further membership. Each enlargement towards the Western Balkans renews the need to develop a mechanism to prevent the spillover of unilateral and bilateral disputes and interests to the multilateral level of the European Union,â€ said Lejla RamiÄ‡-MesihoviÄ‡, head of the Department for International Relations and European Studies at the private International Burch University based in Bosnia and Herzegovina.She added that in many ways this limited the geopolitical plans and interests of the European Union, but also endangered the level of security and stability of the Western Balkans, which regarded the European Union as the most desirable geopolitical haven.Spainâ€™s EU Presidency gives hopeSpain takes over the EU Council presidency on 1 July with its sights set on the Western Balkans. The Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez visited all the countries in the region, except Kosovo, last summer, while his Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares recently expressed his desire to strengthen Spain's relations with the Western Balkans. In October, the Spanish foreign minister will probably bring together the heads of diplomacy of each EU country with their counterparts from the Western Balkans.Kosovo remains the most sensitive issue for Spain in the process of EU enlargement towards the Western Balkans. The refusal of Spain and four other member states – Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia and Romania – to recognise Kosovoâ€™s independence from Serbia in 2008 complicates Pristinaâ€™s prospects of joining the bloc, although the Kosovar authorities applied for candidate status late last year. Moreover, Spain is the only country in the Schengen area that does not recognise visa-free travel for citizens with Kosovar passports, despite the support of the European Parliament and other Schengen countries for visa liberalisation. Kosovo was the last country in the Western Balkans to get this visa scheme in April of 2023.In 2019, then Kosovar President Hashim ThaÃ§i urged Madrid to recognise Kosovo's independence, arguing that ""Spain is not Serbia, because it is not governed by a Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ‡, and neither is Catalonia Kosovo.""Serbia expects the Spanish Presidency to focus on enlargementâ€œGiven that discussions are taking place at the highest level of the EU on a possible reform and improvement of the enlargement policy, the fact that Spain is a country traditionally friendly to this policy is certainly encouraging,â€ said Milena LazareviÄ‡ from the European Policy Centre, a think tank based in Belgrad.Due to Spain's firm stance on not recognising Kosovo, she doesnâ€™t expect that the Spanish government will put Kosovo's application for membership on the agenda.Meanwhile, the situation in northern Kosovo remains tense after the recent violent clashes between NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) soldiers and ethnic Serbs in the town of ZveÄan. The ongoing escalation has frozen the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue, that resulted in the Ohrid agreement for the normalisation of the relations last March. Serbs – who account for about six percent of Kosovoâ€™s population – boycotted last monthâ€™s elections in northern towns where they are a majority, allowing ethnic Albanians to take control of local councils despite a minuscule turnout of under 3.5 percent of voters.Many Serbs are demanding both the withdrawal of Kosovo police forces and of the ethnic Albanian mayors they do not consider their true representatives. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, but Belgrade has refused to recognise it, effectively preventing Kosovo from having a seat at the United Nations.This article is published weekly.

Label codes do not point out genetically modified produce,"Four- and five-digit codes on stickers affixed to fruit and vegetables are used to control inventory and facilitate the checkout process. Yet, misleading posts that went viral on Facebook continue to claim that the numbers make it possible to know whether the produce had been genetically modified. This is false, industry representatives said. While the consumer can identify whether an item is organic from the code, it is not possible to know whether the produce was genetically modified. In any case, the cultivation and sale of GMO produce is banned in France. EU law is also strict on the matter of labelling when it comes to GMOs.nd here. Screenshot taken on June 2, 2023 of a post on FacebookThe photo shows an apple with a label that mentions the variety of fruit and the four-digit code ""4173"", while the text claims that the code, when it begins with 3 or 4, proves that the fruit ""had been sprayed with pesticides"". As for the five-digit codes, those beginning with a 9 indicate that the fruit is organic while those beginning with an 8 indicate that the product is genetically modified, the post further claims.A Facebook search showed that this post had already circulated in French in 2021. It also appeared on social media elsewhere, including in Greece, where an orange was used as the example. AFP had already fact-checked the same claim in the US a few years ago.Internet users have also shared variations on the claim -- such as in North America and Malaysia -- in which they incorrectly suggest the codes indicate where the product was manufactured. Faster checkoutAn internet search shows that these label codes are called Price Look-Up or PLU codes.They are used in numerous countries to classify products, update inventories and facilitate the checkout process. Tomatoes on a supermarket stall in France, May 31, 2023 ( AFP / JOEL SAGET)""PLU codes are used by retail companies to facilitate the checkout process. They are used to identify bulk and random or variable weight fruits and vegetables, as well as nuts and herbs. In most cases, the PLU code is printed onto a small sticker affixed to the fruit and vegetables and includes four or five digits,"" the French fresh produce trade association Interfel told AFP in an email on June 6, 2023. ""The PLU system is one developed to assist retailers at the Point of Sale (POS) to ensure that product sold loose, bulk, unpackaged could be accurately identified at POS and that customers paid the correct amount for the item,"" Jane Proctor, Chair of the IFPS Product Identification Committee, had previously said in an email to AFP dated December 14, 2022. ""Without a numbering or scanning solution, checkout/POS clerks would need to make a decision on which variety of an item they were seeing, including if it was organically produced, which is, of course, extremely difficult, if not impossible to do, visually,"" she added. The main supermarkets have been using these codes since the 90s, but they are not obligatory or required by law. The International Federation for Produce Standards (IFPS) randomly assigns the codes to various fruit and vegetables within the 3000, 4000, 83000 and 84000 series of numbers, according to their website. For example, 4173 is the code on the apple in the photo shared on Facebook in France. On page five of the Global and Regional PLU list, we see that the number does indeed refer to small apples of the Royal Gala variety. Screenshot, taken on June 2, 2023, of the IFPS websiteThe code on the apple label is thus consistent with a fruit and vegetable reference system whose objective is to notably apply the associated price at checkout. Prefix 9 for organic In this context, the Facebook posts are misleading. On the one hand, they provide the correct meaning of the code prefix for organic fruits and vegetables. But on the other hand, it is exaggerated in the case of non-organic produce and downright wrong regarding genetically modified fruits and vegetables, as they have no specific code and are in any case absent from store shelves in France. First, the four-digit codes within the 3000 and 4000 series are for conventionally grown produce, the IFPS said on its website. This means that pesticides and fertiliser were used to cultivate them. ""The four-digit series denotes fruit and vegetables grown using traditional methods,"" Interfel told AFP. That is what the viral online posts refer to when they hyperbolise that products whose codes begin with the digit three or four were ""sprayed with pesticides"". Next, for organic products, a prefix -- in this case 9 -- is placed at the beginning of the codes, which thus become five-digit numbers. For organic products, ""the prefix of '9' would be placed in front of the 4-digit conventionally grown code for organic produce,"" the IFPS told AFP in December 2022. It is also what it says on its website.""For example, the PLU code 4011 refers to a banana grown using traditional methods, while the PLU code 94011 refers to an organic banana,"" Interfel said. A fruit and vegetable section of a supermarket in France, November 3, 2022 ( AFP / CHRISTOPHE SIMON)However, a code that begins with 8 absolutely does not mean that the fruit or vegetable had been genetically modified, experts told AFP. Prefix 8 extends number of available codesProctor explained that ""at one time, the '8' was designated as the number to add to any IFPS PLU to indicate that the item was a GMO fresh fruit or vegetable"". However, it ""was never used"" at retail, she added. Because there are not many GMO fruits and vegetables, and because their production methodology does not affect their price, there was no need for a specific label, Proctor explained. That is also what the French trade association says. In 2018, the IFPS had already indicated in a press statement that ""though the '8' prefix (83000-84999) was once reserved for GMO produce items, the prefix was never used at retail"".Melons on a supermarket stall in France, May 31, 2023 ( AFP / JOEL SAGET)Instead, as IFPS was concerned that the 3000 and 4000 series numbers would eventually be used up, ""it was determined that the '8' as the leading 5th digit would be used going forward to extend the amount of numbers available for assignment as new items are introduced to the market"", Proctor said. So when the 3000 to 4999 series have been exhausted, new product varieties will be coded with the 83000 to 84999 series.As of June 5, 2023, the IFPS online database does not yet have a product coded with the ""8"" prefix.Consumers therefore cannot rely on these number series to tell them whether a fruit or vegetable has been genetically modified. No cultivation and sales of GMO produce in FranceIt is necessary to point out that ""neither the cultivation of GMO fruit and vegetables nor their commercialisation is permitted in France and in Europe,"" according to the website of the CTIFL, a research and development organisation for the French fresh produce sector.Interfel, too, said that ""to our knowledge, there is no GMO fruit and vegetable importation"" in France. Only ""around 100 GMOs and/or their by-products are authorised for importation and use in human and animal food,"" the CTIFL said. These authorisations, delivered at the European level, concern ""corn, soy, rapeseed, cotton and sugar beet"" but they ""do not allow for the cultivation of corresponding GMOs"". That is also what the French agriculture ministry explains on its website. Furthermore, EU law is strict on the matter. The regulations concerning the traceability of genetically modified organisms (No. 1830/2003) and their labelling (No. 1829/2003) foresee a system that enables the consumer to clearly identify these products or their presence in a processed product. The regulation No. 1830/2003 of September 22, 2003 clearly explains on page three that ""operators shall ensure that for pre-packaged products consisting of, or containing GMOs, the words 'This product contains genetically modified organisms' or 'This product contains genetically modified [name of organism(s)]' appear on a label"".GaÃ«lle GEOFFROYTous ses articlesThÃ©ophile BLOUDANISTous ses articlesMarisha GoldhamerTous ses articlesAFP FranceTous ses articlesAFP GrÃ¨ceTous ses articlesAFP Etats-UnisTous ses articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Schallenberg sees no breach of neutrality through Sky Shield,"Austrian foreign minister says European airspace defence system Sky Shield  is about â€œpooling and sharing.â€ In other news: Spain kicks off its EU Council presidency, the EU wants to reduce food waste by 30 percent until 2030 and the EU summit ends without consensus on asylum policy. Vienna (APA) – According to Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg (Ã–VP; conservative), Austria's planned accession to the European airspace defence system Sky Shield would not constitute a breach of Austrian neutrality. Sky Shield was neither a NATO initiative nor an entry into a military alliance, but merely ""the cooperation of a number of states,"" the foreign minister stressed. The initiative was about ""pooling and sharing.""Schallenberg pointed out that France, an important NATO member, was not participating in the initiative. He admitted that Austria, apart from NATO aspirant Sweden, was currently the only non-NATO state that wanted to join the initiative. Austria's neutrality would remain 100 percent guaranteed in the event of a participation in Sky Shield, he said.In response to questions, Schallenberg emphasised the federal government's commitment to Austria's perpetual neutrality and denied that Sky Shield could possibly be a military alliance. Schallenberg justified this with the lack of an assistance clause: ""There is no automatism. It is simply that one shares information.""Prior to this, Herbert Kickl, leader of the FPÃ– (far-right)had sharply criticised Austria's planned entry to the European airspace defence system in a press release, claiming that this would endanger Austria's neutrality. (2 July)Spain opens its EU Council presidency in Kiev with strong support for UkraineKiev (EFE) – Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez kicked off Spain's EU presidency on 1 July with a symbolic visit to Kiev, announcing more armoured vehicles and additional financial aid to revive the Ukrainian economy.His trip to Kiev on the first day of the rotating European presidency, which Spain will hold for the next six months until 31 December, ""demonstrates the clear and unequivocal political commitment of the EU institutions"" to Ukraine, SÃ¡nchez said after meeting with the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Ukraineâ€™s president urged that the twelfth package of European sanctions against Russia should include a ban on doing business with the Russian nuclear energy company Rosatom.""I wanted to tell you that we are with you and we will be with you for as long as it takes. I wanted to tell you that we will support Ukraine, no matter what the price may be ,"" SÃ¡nchez said in a speech to Ukraineâ€™s parliament, the Rada, before announcing a new aid package of 55 million euros for Ukraine. The Spanish president praised Ukraine's progress in meeting the requirements for Brussels to begin negotiations for EU accession, and encouraged Ukraine to continue on the ""path of reforms."" (1 July) Transgenic rice plants from Spain, genetically altered to be resistant to attack by a rice borer (Chilo suppressalis), have been sown for the first time by the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and the Institute for Research and Agri-environmental Technology (IRTA) in the Ebro Delta. Photo: EFE/JAUME SELLARTThe EU wants to reduce food waste from shops, restaurants and households by 30 percentBrussels (AFP) – According to a draft law consulted by AFP on Friday, the European Commission wants to require the EU-27 to reduce food waste from shops, restaurants and households in the EU by 30 percent by 2030 compared to 2020.This legislative proposal, which is due to be made public on Wednesday and will then be debated by the member states and MEPs, is part of the European Green Deal.By limiting food waste, the legislation aims to reduce the unnecessary use of water, fertilisers and energy to produce, process and preserve food that ends up in the bin.Under the proposed text, each member state would be required to reduce ""the volume of food waste generated in shops, restaurants and catering services, and in households"" by 30 percent compared to the volumes recorded in 2020.These figures are calculated ""per capita"" to take population differences into account. (30 June)EU summit ends without consensus on asylum policyBrussels (dpa) – At the EU summit, the 27 member states failed to reach a consensus on European asylum policy due to a blockade by Hungary and Poland. This was confirmed by several EU diplomats to Deutsche Presse-Agentur in Brussels on Friday. No joint declaration on migration was issued, but a paper by EU Council President Charles Michel.Poland and Hungary had blocked prepared texts on asylum policy. They rejected a compromise agreed by a majority of the EUâ€™s interior ministers at the beginning of June without their consent. The upcoming negotiations with the European Parliament in the current legislative process can nevertheless start. Still, the blockade by the two countries is highly symbolic -– and could jeopardise other EU projects.Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban threatened to block EU funds for the delivery of weapons and equipment to the Ukrainian armed forces. On state radio, he described the Brussels negotiations as a ""migration war"" in the meeting room. (30 June)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

NATO mulls Ukraine membership as Kiev insists on joining,"Kiev, backed by NATO allies in Eastern Europe, has demanded a commitment at next week's NATO summit in Vilnius that Ukraine will join the military alliance once the war with Russia is over. The military alliance is still considering an appropriate response to Kiev's demands.Kiev has been pushing for Ukraine to join the military alliance for months. But whether the country would eventually join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) depended on its Western partners, the Ukrainian leader said in his daily video address on Wednesday.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke by telephone with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Tuesday, after NATO member states extended Stoltenbergâ€™s term until 1 October 2024. Stoltenberg has been in office since 2014. His term was last extended until September 2023 in March 2022, shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.NATO's 31 member states are currently haggling over the precise wording of a final summit communiquÃ© on Ukraine's potential membership. Allied leaders will also try to agree on a new defence spending target.NATO-Ukraine Council: a possible compromise?Ahead of the NATO summit, Eastern European countries are pushing to ensure a clear timetable for Ukraine's membership, while the US and Germany lead the reluctant side and London is engaged in mediation. The establishment of the NATO-Ukraine Council is considered a compromise in order to strengthen ties in view of a future membership to the North Atlantic alliance.The Council would allow Ukraine to participate much more closely in the work of NATO allies and to be involved in its development. It would mean an initial political integration, accompanying the multi-year military assistance plan which aims to render the Ukrainian armed forces â€œfully interoperableâ€ with NATO forces.A first discussion has been held at an Informal meeting of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs in Oslo, where Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani supported the idea of setting up a NATO-Ukraine Council. ""Today we have noted everyone's commitment to continue to support Ukraine with great strength, and we have talked about its possible future membership of the Atlantic Alliance,"" he said. ""For Italy, an important step before setting a date for membership is the establishment of the NATO-Ukraine Council, so that we can strengthen cooperation and thus make Ukraine feel part of a strategy,â€ Tajani added.More recently, during a symbolic visit to Kiev on 1 July – the starting day of Spain's six-month presidency of the EU – Spanish President Pedro SÃ¡nchez pledged Spain's support for Ukraine ""for as long as it takes"" and called for the creation of a NATO-Ukraine Council to ""enhance Kiev's political participation"" in the military alliance.Sanchez announced the sending of more armoured vehicles and additional financial aid to revive the Ukrainian economy, and the two leaders signed a joint declaration in which Spain said it supported ""the strengthening of the NATO alliance with Ukraine.""However, the Spanish government has not clarified whether it is in favour of opening the door for Ukraine to join NATO. On 21 June, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, refused to state Spain's position, saying that the issue would be discussed with other member states at next weekâ€™s summit in Vilnius.Fortifying NATOâ€™s eastern flankZelensky arrived in the Bulgarian capital Sofia on Thursday for a one-day visit. He was received by Bulgarian President Rumen Radev, Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov and Deputy Prime Minister Mariya Gabriel, and held talks with political group leaders in the Bulgarian parliament.On the same day, the Bulgarian National Assembly adopted a declaration in support of Ukraine's membership in NATO once the war was over. Parliament declares that the most direct and desirable way to restore peace in Ukraine is the full and immediate voluntary withdrawal of Russian forces from the internationally recognised national territory of all sovereign states concerned.During the visit, a joint declaration on Ukraine's Euro-Atlantic integration and a memorandum on energy cooperation were signed.â€œI want to thank you, Bulgaria, for the support and protection of our people,â€ Zelensky said at a news conference referring to key military supplies Sofia had been providing to Kiev since the first days of the war.The new pro-Western government in Bulgaria has promised further support  to Ukraine in its battle to force Russian invaders out of the country. Recently, however, President Radev rejected Bulgaria's participation in a joint European Union initiative to supply ammunition to Ukraine.At the EU summit in Brussels last week, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob had said that a lasting peace in Ukraine was a precondition for starting negotiations on the country's NATO membership. ""There is a variety of views and formulas on Ukraine's NATO membership. I think time will tell if any of the existing formulas are acceptable,"" Golob stated. There was no doubt that Ukraine was on the road to the Euro-Atlantic alliance, but the length of the journey would depend on various factors, the prime minister added.Romanian President Klaus Iohannis recalled that at the 2008 NATO Summit in Bucharest, the allies decided that Ukraine and Georgia would become NATO members in the future. Over time, Romania's position on NATO enlargement has been reiterated by Iohannis, who has stressed that ""the Alliance needs a strong, long-term posture, a truly advanced defence capable of responding to all threats.""""Given our strategic position, Romania is particularly interested in further strengthening the Eastern flank through a coherent and unified approach.

The US envoy stated she expected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to attend next week's meeting, and that his presence would send a ""powerful"" message to Russian leader Vladimir Putin.NATO diplomats say the US is reluctant to go beyond a 2008 pledge made in Bucharest, which promised Ukraine membership but set no timetable.

Europe in brief: Largest bridge over the Danube opened for traffic,"The EU's third-largest suspension bridge opened in Romania. Meta does not launch Twitter competitor in the bloc due to regulatory issues. Further: The Commission intends to close the CVM and wants to take action on illegal trade in shark fins. North Macedonia signs cooperation agreement on the Unionâ€™s LIFE Programme for the protection of the environment and climate activities.Braila (AGERPRES) – In Romania, the largest bridge across the Danube has been opened to traffic. It will link the Black Sea and Danube delta ports to the rest of the country and the trans-European transport network.The EU contribution to the project amounts to 363 million euros from cohesion policy funds.With four lanes, a length of 2 kilometres and a location 38 metres above water levels, the bridge is the largest in Romania, the largest crossing the Danube and the third-largest suspension bridge in the European Union.The bridge enables the free transit of vessels and replaces a slow and unreliable ferry ride, which was often interrupted in winter and inclement weather.The opening of this bridge is expected to reduce journey times by approximately 50 minutes and serve around 11,400 vehicles per day.The project will also contribute to the construction of 23.4 kilometres of transport infrastructure such as roads, bridges, junctions, level crossings and overpasses that will meet the needs of the population in the regions of Moldova and Dobrogea. (6 July)Meta: Twitter competitor Threads not launched in the EU due to regulatory issuesNew York (AFP) – Meta has decided not to make its new social network Threads, which is presented as a competitor to Twitter, available to internet users in the European Union, a source close to the matter said on Wednesday. The decision was linked to European regulations, it added.The new platform, which looks very similar to Twitter, is preparing to make its debut at a time when Twitter is in a fragile state.As far as Europe is concerned, the source says that Meta has chosen to wait while it clarifies the consequences of the new Digital Market Regulation (DMA), which came into force at the beginning of May.The DMA aims to impose specific rules on key internet companies, including Meta, to prevent anti-competitive practices.The group, based in Menlo Park, California, still intends to launch Threads in the European Union at a date yet to be determined. (5 July)European Commission intends to close the Cooperation and Verification MechanismBrussels/Sofia (BTA) – The European Commission has announced that it sent a letter to the Council of the European Union about its intention to close the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM). Under this mechanism, the Commission has monitored the state of the rule of law in Bulgaria and Romania since the two countries joined the EU in 2007. The Commission has specified that monitoring would continue through the EU's rule of law reports.The response from the EU Council is expected by the end of August, European Commission Vice-President Vera Jourova said. She pointed out that the Commission had presented the last report on Bulgaria under the mechanism in 2019 and then clarified that the requirements were met. In Bulgaria and Romania, there was more to be done on the rule of law as in the rest of the EU, Jourova said.She recommended diplomatic action to achieve a positive decision on Bulgaria's and Romania's accession to Schengen, specifying that there was no link between the CVM and the enlargement of the European area without border checks. Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders pointed out that the political situation in Bulgaria had been complicated of late, hampering the adoption of reforms. â€œI hope the changes that have taken place will facilitate the necessary reforms,â€ he said.@EU_Commission presented today the 2023 Rule of Law report. ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º will take take steps to end the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬&ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡´.

The Commission noted that there was still a lack of effective investigations and convictions for high-level corruption. (5 July)Trade in severed shark fins must stop, European Commission findsBrussels (Belga) – The illegal trade in severed shark fins must stop. This was demonstrated by the more than 1 million signatories of a European citizens' initiative, and now the European Commission also wants to take action.The international trade in severed shark fins is facilitated by so-called â€finningâ€. This is a particularly cruel practice in which captured sharks have their fins cut off, after which the carcass is thrown back into the sea. The animal then bleeds to death on the seabed or dies from suffocation. Shark fins are particularly popular in East and Southeast Asia, to make shark fin soup or to use in medicine.For that market, millions of sharks are caught each year in Europe. Spain is one of the main exporters. To combat finning, there is already a European regulation banning the practice, but according to the initiators of the citizens' initiative 'Stop finning - Stop the trade', it is impossible to check whether exported fins were cut off on land after the catch, or already removed on the deck of the fishing boat. Indeed, there is too little monitoring of whether fishermen effectively land the sharks they catch.The @EU_Commission announced its next step for a #FinBanNow! ðŸ¦ˆðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º #ECI #StopFinningEU welcomes the CommissionÂ´s recognition of the importance of #sharks and their protection. More info âž¡ https://t.co/x5yGdnhSDC pic.twitter.com/gxUSSfXxbc— StopFinningEU (@StopFinningEU) July 5, 2023 The Commission had declared the citizens' initiative admissible earlier this year and now wants to act on it. Without making any concrete promises, it said on Wednesday that it intends to examine the possibility of proposing new legislation to end the trade in severed shark fins. It will carry out an impact assessment on this and also wants to better monitor the trade in shark products.The Commission stresses that sharks play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of marine ecosystems. Many shark populations are in a critical situation: as many as one-third of all shark species are threatened with extinction. Finning is one of their biggest threats. (5 July)Shukova: Participation in LIFE Programme opened access to new European financial mechanismsSkopje (MIA) – North Macedoniaâ€™s Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning Kaja Shukova met European Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries Virginijus SinkeviÄius and signed an agreement between the European Union and the Republic of North Macedonia on cooperation in the Union's LIFE Programme for the environment and climate action.As announced by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the LIFE Programme is an instrument for financing the European Union's action on the environment and climate. It aims to contribute to the implementation, updating and development of EU policy and legislation on the environment and climate through co-financing European projects with added value. It supports projects in the field of nature, biodiversity, circular economy, quality of life and climate change mitigation as well as the adaptation of and transition to clean energy.With the signing of the agreement on the participation of the Republic of North Macedonia in this programme, as Minister Shukova said at the meeting, access to these financial mechanisms of the EU would be enabled for the first time. This would open up new opportunities of applying for projects and better social involvement in the implementation of European policies for the management of global challenges. It would facilitate the implementation of common goals for a healthier and less polluted environment, better protected nature, biodiversity and a decarbonised future.

Czech president did not say the West was 'manipulating' Ukraine,"Czech President Petr Pavel spoke at a recent Czech Radio conference about the need to provide Ukraine with as much support as possible and warned of the spread of pro-Russian disinformation. That same day, a video went viral on social media that seemed to show Pavel had said the opposite. By cutting key words from the original footage, the edited clip made it sound as though Pavel had accused the West of ""manipulating"" Ukraine to ""fight against Russia"". However, the full recording shows that Pavel was talking about the Kremlin's propaganda campaign at that point and describing how the Russian leader promotes a narrative of the West using Ukraine in order to justify his invasion. Pavel's entire speech was critical of Russia.The eight-second manipulated video went viral on the Telegram channel neCT24, where it was viewed by more than 7,700 users.In April 2022, the Czech Hybrid Threats Centre, which is part of the interior ministry, identified the neCT24 Telegram channel as a successor to the Sputnik channel. Sputnik, along with fellow Russian state media outlet Russia Today, was blocked by the European Union shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. In the edited clip, Pavel appears to say: ""The West is manipulating Ukraine and inciting it to do the worst because it wants to use Ukraine as a tool in its own fight against Russia."" The Czech Radio logo and the words ""Media and Ukraine"" can be seen in the background.The clip also appeared on Facebook, for example in this post from June 23, 2023, which was shared by nearly 100 users. It claims that ""Petr Pavel finally came clean and admitted that the West was using Ukraine against Russia.""Screenshot taken on Facebook on June 26, 2023The video also went viral on Twitter, where it was viewed by more than 3,200 users. The shared clip bears the watermark of both neCT24 and the recently established website 42TCen.cz, which is just a reversal of the name of the neCT24 Telegram channel. Pavel supported Ukraine at the Prague conferenceBy searching for the keywords ""Media and Ukraine"" and ""Petr Pavel"", AFP found that the president had recently appeared as a keynote speaker at a Prague conference called Media and Ukraine, organised by Czech Radio, on June 22, 2023.In his opening speech, Pavel clearly showed support for Ukraine. He also spoke of the need to fight against disinformation, which he said he believed Russia had been using to target not only the West but also its own citizens. At the 3:48 minute mark of the original recording, Pavel said the following in his speech: ""Through propaganda, Putin has instilled in the Russian people the identity of a victim. He has convinced the Russian people that they have reason to feel threatened and that they have every right to defend themselves against this threat. He lied that the West is manipulating Ukraine and inciting it to do the worst because it wanted to use Ukraine as a tool in its own struggle against Russia.""In the edited clip, the words ""He lied that..."" are cut so that Pavel's quote appears to start with the words ""the West is manipulating"", thus creating a false impression of what he said.https://youtu.be/43hbCWWiOVk?t=231It is therefore clear that the eight-second clip shared on social media has been edited to remove the fact that Pavel was referring to Putin's anti-West propaganda messaging in this part of the speech. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, AFP has fact-checked many false claims related to this conflict.

Europe in brief: Weber warns of rise of German far right,"German MEP and EPP group leader Manfred Weber rules out cooperation between far-right AfD and other German conservative parties. Denis ZvizdiÄ‡, Chair of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), calls on NATO to deploy soldiers on the territory of the BrÄko district to prevent secession. French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire is convinced that the EU could have its own generative AI within the next five years.EPP chief Weber: AfD is ""opponent and enemy"".Berlin/Brussels (dpa) – German politician and President of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP) Manfred Weber rules out any cooperation between the German conservative CDU and CSU parties and the far-right AfD. ""The firewall stands,"" the head of the EPP told German media group Funke. According to Weber, the AfD wants to destroy what the CDU and CSU have always stood for. ""That is why for us it is not only a political competitor, but an opponent and an enemy.""Weber announced that he wanted to put the fight against the AfD at the centre of the European election campaign. Elections in Germany are expected to take place on 9 June 2024.The deputy CSU leader said that those who vote for AfD must know that they are endangering every second job in Germany. ""We live from exports. And anyone who questions the European single market is putting the axe to our prosperity. In the same way, Germany's security is being endangered because the AfD is nothing but a stirrup holder for Putin,"" Weber said.The AfD wants to abolish the European Union, Weber continued. ""This is a fundamental attack on the historical achievements of the Union. We will defend the legacy of (German politicians) Adenauer, StrauÃŸ, Kohl and Merkel – and put (the fight against) the AfD's destructive idea at the centre of next year's European election campaign. A battle for the soul of Europe is coming – also in Germany.""At the same time, Weber defended his rapprochement with post-fascist Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. He said that Italy was needed to solve the migration issue. ""We are currently implementing a migration agreement with Tunisia together with Italy. This will reduce arrivals in the EU.""Commenting on the current very strong poll numbers for the AfD, Weber said, ""In Europe, we have had the rise of populists and radicals for years. Germany has been relatively immune up to now – also because it was led in a stable way in terms of domestic politics during the Merkel years. Now we have a development similar to that in other countries."" (9 July)ZvizdiÄ‡ calls on NATO for deployment of soldiers in Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s BrÄko districtSarajevo (FENA) – Ahead of the allianceâ€™s summit on July 11 and 12, Chairman of the House of Representatives of the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Denis ZvizdiÄ‡ called on NATO to make a decision on the deployment of NATO soldiers on the territory of BrÄko district in BiH.After the war, the former municipality of BrÄko in the north of Bosnia was declared by international arbitration to be a district that has its own separate local administration and is not part of either of the two Bosnia and Herzegovina entities.The call to deploy NATO troops in the BrÄko district comes amid growing security concerns in BiH following several moves by Republika Srpska President Milorad Dodik to break away from BiH and move closer to Serbia.â€œBearing in mind that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Western Balkans will also be discussed at the summit, I invite the members of the NATO alliance, the friends of integral, sovereign, multi-ethnic, anti-fascist, European and democratic Bosnia and Herzegovina, to deploy NATO soldiers to the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the basis of Annex 1A of the Dayton Peace Agreement and Article 7 of the BrÄko Statute District of Bosnia and Herzegovina,â€ said ZvizdiÄ‡.With such a decision, he said, the project of secession of the BiH entity of Republika Srpska from Bosnia and Herzegovina would be stopped by a preventive measure, and then permanently disabled. At the same time, he emphasised, one of the biggest dangers facing Bosnia and Herzegovina would be successfully eliminated.â€œThe overwhelming majority of BiH citizens wants peace, stability and progress and with great satisfaction and sincere support would welcome the decision on NATO forces in BrÄko District of BiH as a permanent solution to the long-standing anti-state and secessionist policy,â€ said ZvizdiÄ‡. (9 July)The EU can have its own generative AI system ""within five years,"" says Bruno Le MaireAix-en-Provence, Bouches-du-RhÃ´ne (AFP) – On Saturday, the French minister for the economy said that it was possible for the European Union to build its own generative artificial intelligence (AI) system ""within five years,"" which he believes would help to improve the productivity of a ""languishing economy.â€""Generative artificial intelligence will enable us, for the first time in several generations, to become more productive and more efficient,"" Bruno Le Maire told an audience at the Rencontres Ã©conomiques d'Aix-en-Provence in the South of France.""Before laying the foundations for regulating artificial intelligence, I would therefore urge us to innovate, to invest and to set ourselves the goal of having a European OpenAI within five years, with the necessary computers, scientists and algorithms. It can be done,"" he added.It is science ""that will finally enable us to make productivity gains in a European economy that is a little sluggish,"" more ""long-winded"" than ""high-speed,"" he insisted. (8 July 2023)Leuven research centre imec plays key role in European Chips ActLeuven (Belga) – The ambition of the European Chips Act, proposed in February of last year, is to double the production capacity for computer chips in Europe by 2030. Currently, the EU has a 10 per cent market share. Since demand for chips is also expected to double by 2030, the ambition actually amounts to a quadrupling of current production capacity.To reinforce the plans, European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, together with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo, Flemish Minister-President Jan Jambon and Flemish Minister for Work and Economy Jo Brouns, visited Leuven's imec institute on Friday. imec is a world-renowned research centre in nano technology. Just about every new chip technology discovered in the world is tested at imec on a slightly larger scale. This allows learning what additional needs there are to move from a lab setting to a scale of mass production: imec forms the bridge between innovative discoveries and manufacturing companies.""The role imec plays in the European Union's ambitions will be particularly significant. To be less dependent on East Asia, we need to scale up our production here in Europe: imec is essential for our economic security. For investors who need to research and test their innovations before moving to mass production, it is an important place,"" von der Leyen said.The EU plans to invest up to 750 million euros in imec under the Chips Act, and for every euro the EU invests, the Flemish government will do the same. Thus, the total investment could reach 1.5 billion euros. The intention is to invest the money in a new pilot line at imec, which will further develop chip technologies. More specifically, the current clean room in Leuven will be expanded. The clean room, a completely shock and dust-free area, is where the research effectively takes place: all high-tech equipment to develop chips comes together there.

Knife-edge win for nature restoration law foreshadows 2024 European election battle,"On Wednesday, the battle over the nature restoration law entered a knife-edge vote in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. The key biodiversity bill was adopted with a slim majority after weeks of fierce debate - with some saying it fell victim to electioneering. In June 2022, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen proposed the nature restoration bill which is part of the Green Deal. The proposal to rehabilitate at least 20 percent of Europe's degraded ecosystems by 2030 is seen as a central pillar of the EUâ€™s biodiversity strategy.The law, which had previously been rejected by the parliamentâ€™s committees, aims to resuscitate degraded ecosystems by boosting forested areas and marine habitats and increasing connectivity between rivers. It is part of the long-term recovery strategy for damaged nature across the EUâ€™s territory as more than 80 percent of European habitats are in poor condition. It is also intended to make the EU more resilient in the face of global warming - but it has proved divisive.Opposition came in particular from the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP), von der Leyenâ€™s own parliamentary grouping.On Wednesday, the controversial proposal survived the vote in the European Parliament with 336 in favour, 300 against and 13 abstentions.ðŸŒ³ðŸEU Nature Restoration LawParliament adopts its position for negotiations with @EUCouncil Press release to come shortly pic.twitter.com/e8u6bRf9wf— EP PressService (@EuroParlPress) July 12, 2023 â€˜European Trumpismâ€™ or sincere worry about food security?The nature restoration law triggered intense controversy leading up to the vote. Had it been rejected, the EUâ€™s climate neutrality targets may have been in jeopardy.The bill has become a potent campaign issue ahead of European elections in June 2024 with left wing and centrist lawmakers accusing the EPP of using the bill as a political football.""What we are seeing now... I would call 'European Trumpism,'"" said French MEP Pascal Canfin, member of the liberal Renew grouping and chair of the parliament's environment committee, referring to former US president Donald Trump's go-it-alone governing style and policies rolling back environmental protection. Before the vote, Dutch MEP Mohammed Chahim from the centre-left Socialists and Democrats grouping (S&D) said that â€œapparently, the elections have started, and it's all at the expense of nature.""The parliament's biggest political grouping, the conservative European People's Party (EPP), which woos Europe's farmers as a key constituency, had sought to shoot down the text, arguing that it would reduce EU food security, hurt farmers and fishermen, and limit possibilities to build wind and hydroelectric energy facilities.The EPP worries that the nature restoration law will hurt farmers. Photo: Philipp Schulze/dpaBy rejecting the bill, German EPP leader Manfred Weber strengthened the axis with the right-wing parties. Ahead of the vote, a lead EPP lawmaker on the issue, German MEP Peter Liese, said the commission's draft law was ""such a bad proposal"" that rejecting it was ""the only alternative."" The German MEP stressed that the EPP had backed ""many, many other"" Green Deal laws but ""we are already on the edge of doing too much.â€The law also divided Croatian left-wing and right-wing MEPs, who had opposing interpretations of the impact of the law on the countryâ€™s fishermen. Tomislav Sokol (EPP) noted that if fishing and trawling were limited with excessively strict measures, it would no longer be possible to buy local but imported fish. Fred MatiÄ‡ (S&D), on the other hand, stressed that this regulation would prevent foreign fish from being served in Croatia.EU legislators from socialist, green and left-wing groups in the parliament supported the legislation, with many joining Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg in a demonstration backing it on Tuesday. ""Our message to the politicians is to choose nature, to choose people, over profit and greed,"" she said at the protest in Strasbourg.Simultaneously, farmers driving their tractors responded to a call by the European farmers' association Copa-Cogeca and demonstrated against the nature conservation law in front of the parliament building.A split in the Ursula majority, unprecedented unity between othersThe approval of the text confirmed the split in von der Leyenâ€™s majority.""The obstruction by the right, the extreme-right and some of the liberals has led to a largely watered-down version being adopted."", said Belgian MEP Caroline Roose (Greens). Seas At Risk, a non-governmental organisation lobbying for maritime environmental protections agreed, criticising what it called ""populist grandstanding"" by right-wing and far-right lawmakers, and the ""significantly weakened"" final position.While there has been criticism, it has been striking to see the unprecedented unity between S&D with Left, Greens and part of Renew, in the corridors of Strasbourg. It is premature to speak of an alternative majority to the one Weber has in mind. But an earthquake has happened with the break-up of the EPP-S&D axis that supported Commission President von der Leyen. She has chosen not to comment on the vote thus far but her moral suasion in favour of the Green Deal, von der Leyen legislatureâ€™s priority, is very likely. The vote is 'a political result for the commission', remarked Paolo Gentiloni, Commissioner for Economy.French MEP Manon Aubry, the co-chair of the Left, said that the vote marked the defeat of an attempt to transfer the right/centre-right alliance backing Meloniâ€™s government in Italy to the EU level.""We are relieved,"" Aubry said. ""It is a great defeat for the coalition between the Peopleâ€™s Party and the Right, a coalition that you know well in Italy with the Meloni government. They tried it in Italy and now they wanted to try in the European Parliament, but we defeated them. It is proof that, together, the parties of the left can save the environmental agenda and defeat the right.â€In the midst of the campaign for the Spanish general election on 23 July, the vote pitted Spain's two main political parties in the European Parliament against each other: the Socialist Party, which voted in favour, and the Popular Party, which voted against.Although the text ended up going through by a narrow margin, the leader of the Social Democrats in the European Parliament, Spain's Iratxe GarcÃ­a, accused the Spanish Popular Party of ""joining the climate change deniers"" as it had sided with the conservative and far-right groups.After Wednesday's vote in the European Parliament, the negotiations with the Council of the European Union can begin.  Photo: Arne Immanuel BÃ¤nsch/dpa Nature restoration law now awaits test of triloguesAfter Wednesdayâ€™s vote, the European Parliament will start negotiations with the Council of the European Union on the final shape of the legislation. The Council, the co-legislator, adopted its negotiating position last week, according to which member states must restore at least 30 percent of the total area of habitats in terrestrial, coastal, freshwater and marine ecosystems that are not in good condition. That differs from what the commission had initially proposed: namely, that this should apply to 30 percent of the total area for each of the seven habitat types.In June, the EU Environment Council adopted the general approach on the nature restoration bill. The environment ministers of the member states did not reach a common position on the proposal by consensus, but by voting.Despite many reservations at home, the Swedish presidency managed to push through the proposal which was adopted by a qualified majority. The draft introduces a long list of flexibilities compared to the European Commission's original proposal.Of the 27 member states, 20 voted in favour, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Sweden were against, while Austria and Belgium abstained.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Schallenberg underlines North Macedonia's European path,"Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg urges EU candidate North Macedonia to accept constitutional changes in order to advance its EU accession process. The government of Morocco seeks a partnership with the EU in the fisheries sector. The European Parliament criticises Austria for vetoing the Schengen accession of Romania and Bulgaria.Schallenberg: North Macedonia risks isolationSkopje (MIA) – If North Macedonia does not accept the constitutional amendments and does not continue on a European path, it runs the risk of being isolated, Austrian Minister for European and International Affairs Alexander Schallenberg said. He took part in a joint press conference in Skopje with North Macedonia's Foreign Minister Bujar Osmani and the foreign ministers of the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Jan LipavskÃ½ and Miroslav WlachovskÃ½.â€œOnce negotiations begin, thatâ€™s an irreversible process. The country has been waiting 18 years to reach this moment. Now it is up to you to use it. It is necessary to be politically responsible and place the national interests above all else. Now is the moment and I assure you that we are not meddling in the internal affairs of the country,â€ said Schallenberg. Schallenberg stressed that a visit of three ministers from three EU member states to a Western Balkan country is not something that happens every day, which, he said, â€œshould be a strong message for you.â€â€œOur message is simple and strong – it is a message of encouragement, there is no time to waste, we would like you to continue with the necessary constitutional amendments, so you can begin membership negotiations. Postponing the adoption of the amendments means a postponement of North Macedoniaâ€™s accession. It would be a shame if Skopje, after running such a difficulty marathon, were to trip up at the next obstacle. Weâ€™ve been through a lot together, and we overcame many difficulties,â€ said Schallenberg.Morocco wants â€œadded valueâ€ to its fisheries pact with the EU – Polisario Front warns against ""illegal agreements""Rabat / Strasbourg (EFE) – The Moroccan government has reiterated its desire for a partnership with the EU with ""more added value"" to its fisheries pact, while the Polisario Front told the media in Strasbourg that it feared Spain would push for new ""illegal agreements"" between Brussels and Rabat. The Polisario Front is a North African politico-military organisation that seeks to end Moroccan control of the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara and win independence for the region.""Morocco considers the model of coming to fish to be outdated,"" Moroccan Foreign Minister Naser Burita said in Rabat. The EU-Morocco fisheries protocol, which allows European vessels to fish in Moroccan and Western Saharan waters, expires on 17 July with no prospect of renewal. This means that European vessels will have to leave the area's fishing grounds. The EU General Court had annulled the agreement in September of 2021 on the grounds that it also covered the waters of the former Spanish colony of Western Sahara and therefore had to take the representation of the Saharawi people into account, a decision that the European side has appealed against. The expected ruling by the EU Court of Justice could uphold or overturn the EU General Courtâ€™s decision from 2021.The suspension of the fisheries agreement means that activity in Moroccan fishing grounds will be paralysed for an indefinite period. The Spanish government plans to provide aid to support vessels and ensure that shipowners and fishermen are not affected by the suspension. Spain has 93 licences to fish in Morocco, but only 19 are currently active. (12 July)European Parliament criticises Austrian veto on Schengen accessionStrasbourg (APA) – The European Parliament has criticised Austria's veto on the accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the border control-free Schengen area. In a legally non-binding resolution adopted on Wednesday, MEPs said the arguments used by Austria for its rejection did not relate to the ""conditions laid down"" for the two countries' accession. The Austrian government cited the high number of asylum applications as the reason for the veto.But the European border agency Frontex had determined ""that Romania and Bulgaria do not represent a migration route to the rest of the Schengen area, based on statistical data,"" the resolution says. However, the exclusion of the two countries from the Schengen area is a ""major social and economic burden,"" it continues. Among other things, it causes ""excessive bureaucracy and additional costs at border crossings,"" traffic jams lasting hours or even days and environmental damage. For example, 46,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide are released annually due to border congestion.The resolution also points out that Bulgaria and Romania ""fulfil the necessary criteria, duly comply with the Schengen obligations and are already making a positive contribution to the Schengen area."" The rejection of the two countries by member states last December had occurred ""without legal justification in relation to the accession criteria,"" the text criticises. The European Commission should therefore investigate whether the EU treaty has been violated.In addition to Austria, the Netherlands had also blocked Bulgaria's accession. However, the Netherlands were not explicitly mentioned in the resolution. The European Parliament is calling for an agreement on the accession of Bulgaria and Romania by the end of 2023.For Austrian MEP Claudia Gamon, the resolution sends a message to the Austrian government. The European Parliament wants to prevent an ""abuse of the right of veto,"" Gamon told a press conference. ""The discussion is by no means over,"" the liberal MEP stressed.""In view of open borders and a rampant welcoming policy, one can only shake one's head in disbelief at such demands,"" said Austrian MEP Harald Vilimsky from the right-wing Freedom Party (FPÃ–). ""As long as the EU's external borders are so open, we must insist on controlling the internal border,"" Vilimsky stressed.

Two years later, this should apply to half of the European road network. The European Parliament made the final decision on Tuesday.""In the future, you should be able to charge your electric car anywhere in the European Union. That is what we are ensuring with these new rules,"" said Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt. She had co-sponsored the political agreement on new rules for an alternative fuel infrastructure reached with EU member states in March.The charging stations, which will be found every 60 kilometres from 2026, will have to have a capacity of at least 400 kilowatts (kW), and from 2028 they will have to be able to generate at least 600 kW. For trucks, there will be a charging station every 60 km from 2031. By then, hydrogen refuelling stations should also be located every 200 km along major motorways.Van Brempt said the new legislation, which had been approved by 514 votes in favour, 52 against and 74 abstentions, would help remove existing barriers to the mass switch to electric mobility. These include the lack of charging infrastructure and the relatively high price of electric cars. Van Brempt therefore wants the industry to look for ""solutions to bring more affordable and smaller electric cars to the market.â€The European Parliament and Member States have already decided that the accessibility of charging stations must be improved. ""The mixture of charging cards and subscription formulas must stop. In the future, you should always be able to pay with your bank card at public charging stations. These charging stations must also be accessible to all types of cars,"" says Van Brempt.The EU also expects transparency in the price of the electricity supplied. The European Commission will be asked to set up a database to inform consumers about alternative fuels, including availability, waiting times and prices at different stations. (11 July)ErdoÄŸan and Michel agree to 'reinvigorate' Turkey-EU relationsVilnius (AFP) – Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and European Council President Charles Michel have agreed to reinvigorate Turkey-EU relations, the latter said after their meeting in Vilnius on the sidelines of a NATO summit on Monday.""Good meeting with President ErdoÄŸan at the NATO summit,"" Charles Michel tweeted. We â€œexplored opportunities ahead to bring cooperation back to the forefront and re-energise our relations,"" he added.A few hours earlier, the Turkish leader had linked his support for Sweden's application to join NATO – which he eventually backed – to his country's negotiations to join the EU, which have been stalling for several years.For its part, the US State Department had said on Monday that Turkey should not link Sweden's NATO membership to its rapprochement with the European Union.

Russian TV falsely claims US surrogacy nonprofit hosts child auctions,"A clip from an old Russian TV report has been shared by thousands of Slovak users with the claim that it shows a ""fair for same-sex couples"" in Belgium in which there were ""legal auctions of children"". This is a false characterisation of the event.The TV report shows a seminar organised by a US-based non-profit organisation that offered consultancy and information for male same-sex couples regarding surrogacy options in countries where commercial surrogacy is legal. Commercial surrogacy refers to the practice of paying surrogate mothers to carry and deliver a child for the intended parents and is not permitted in the European Union.More than 2,400 Facebook users shared the video that was posted in March 2023 to private profiles, such as here and here, along with a Slovak caption claiming that it showed reports of ""auctions of children for homosexual couples"" taking place in Belgium.Screenshot taken on Facebook on May 10, 2023The video features a clip from ""Central Television"", a program on Russian TV channel NTV. The clip was uploaded to the NTV website on October 5, 2019 as part of an article headlined ""Belgium hosts a children's fair for same-sex couples"". In the video, we see two TV presenters.""Can you imagine, a children's fair took place in Belgium. Really a fair. I didn't choose that word by accident as it was quite legally possible to draw up a contract for the sale of babies there,"" says Anna Yankina, one of the presenters and hosts of the Central Television show. ""This fair is for same-sex couples who can find a surrogate mother there and, provided they pay for her services off a price list, become happy parents. Or they can just buy a child from a woman who wants to sell it,"" she adds. After introducing the story, she then claims that the price of one baby ranges from $95,000 to $160,000.""Terrible, there's no other way to put it,"" replies the second presenter, Vadim Takmenev, of the report that NTV also mentioned on Twitter at the time.Back then, the claim was spread by a number of other Russian media outlets, for example here and here.The claims fit into Russian anti-LGBTQ+ disinformation narratives -- outlined in this 2021 report from the European Parliament -- that paint LGBTQI+ people as a threat to children and frame the promotion of  LGBTQI+ rights as a ""colonisation attempt by a morally corrupt and degraded West"".The characterisation of the event is, however, strongly misleading. AFP got in touch with legal experts as well as the NGO that organised the conference, which has taken place in Brussels several times. We confirmed that rather than an ""auction"" of children, which would be illegal under human trafficking laws, the clip shows an informational event aimed at providing resources to male same-sex couples on surrogacy options in places, including the United States and Canada, where the practice is legal. Commercial surrogacy is not legal in Belgium or in other EU member states. The video and its misleading message have been previously debunked or addressed by other fact-checking organisations such as the EUvsDisinfo (here, here), EUfactcheck.eu, Faktograf.hr (here, here), Factcheck.kz, and even the Russian site The Insider.Men Having Babies non-profitMen Having Babies (MHB) is a US-based non-profit which organises conferences and seminars around the world that provide, according to its website, ""educational and practical information to assist prospective parents who are gay, queer, or bisexual men, as well as transwomen achieve biological parenting"". Its mission also includes ""promoting ethical surrogacy practices that minimize the risks"" and ""promoting the affordability of surrogacy related services through advocacy, financial assistance, and the encouragement of transparency and patient feedback.""Ron Poole-Dayan, MHB executive director, told AFP that the organisation only provides information about parenting options and allows people to meet service providers who operate legally in certain US states and Canadian provinces. It does not itself facilitate any surrogacy services.""Of course MHB is not organizing auctions of children, neither online, nor at our 2019 Brussels event or anywhere else. This is not just a lie, but libel and hate speech by the same Russian 'sources' that are trying each and every way they can to tarnish liberal values and undermine the foundations of free societies,"" Poole-Dayan told AFP in March 2023.""What we facilitate is access to information about services that are perfectly legal in the USA and Canada, not the sale and certainly not the auction of existing or future children,"" he added.The event in Brussels, which is referenced in the Russian TV report and which took place in September 2019, was dubbed ""The 5th annual Brussels Conference on Parenting Options for European Gay Men"". MHB has organized many similar events as part of its ""surrogacy seminars and conferences"" in cities like Chicago, New York, Taipei, Tel Aviv, Berlin and San Francisco. Such conferences provide ""unbiased information, access to a wide range of service providers, and networking,"" according to MHB.According to media reports from the time, the 2019 Brussels event featured ""about 24 stands of private clinics and mediation services"" at the conference venue. MHB also published a promotional video from the event on its YouTube channel. Its discussions and panels were recorded and are also available on YouTube.AFP checked the service providers -- surrogacy agencies and fertility clinics -- listed on MHB's website and found all of them to be based in the United States, and not in Belgium or anywhere else in Europe. There was no mention of an ""auction of babies"" taking place at the event in the media reports on the matter, or on the event agenda.According to Poole-Dayan, MHB only ""provides information about parenting options and allows people to meet service providers who operate legally in the USA and Canada, and abide by ethical guidelines"". This refers to MHB's Ethical Framework, which specifies principles and standards that the surrogacy and IVF providers listed by MHB pledged to abide by. ""We also check their publications and track record to make sure they do not facilitate surrogacy in violation of our Baseline Protocols or at destinations outside of the USA and Canada,"" Poole-Dayan said about the service providers.""In the United States, we estimate that the cost of surrogacy tends to range from $90,000 to $180,000, depending on the location and services provided. MHB has no direct control of the cost factors, but we provide our members guidance on how to make informed budgetary decisions,"" he said about the pricing prospective parents can expect when choosing the services of US providers.MHB states that proceeds from their conferences benefit the so-called Gay Parenting Assistance Program (GPAP), a program that aims ""to make building a family more affordable for gay prospective parents that need financial assistance for their surrogacy journey"".This program and the activities of MHB are also the subject of an article about gay couples and surrogacy published by The Guardian in October 2022. According to the article, the GPAP program gives out more than one million dollars a year in discounted and free medical services and cash grants to intended parents in financial need.Surrogacy in EuropeWhen talking about surrogacy, we should specify that we are primarily referring to gestational surrogacy, which is the most common form. In this method, the child is not biologically related to the surrogate carrier. Instead, the embryo is created via in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) using the eggs and sperm of the intended parents or donors, and is then transferred inside the womb of a surrogate.Traditionally, surrogacy can either be altruistic or commercial (here, here). Altruistic surrogacy refers to such surrogacy agreements where the surrogate does not receive monetary compensation. In most of the altruistic surrogacy cases, the surrogate is a relative or close friend of the intended parents.Commercial surrogacy, on the other hand, refers to agreements where the surrogate carrier is compensated by the intended parents not only for medical or travel expenses but also for the entire process of getting pregnant and giving birth to the child. According to Global Market Insights, a market research consultancy firm, the global commercial surrogacy industry was worth an estimated $14 billion in 2022.Within Europe, the practice of surrogacy is regulated individually as per each country's national legislation. As previously reported by AFP or as explained in this 2022 academic article headlined ""Commercial Surrogacy: An Overview"", for example, in countries like Austria, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Poland, the practice is explicitly legally prohibited in all forms. In some countries, only altruistic surrogacy is legal, as is the case for example in Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom.Commercial surrogacy is not legally permitted in any of the EU member states, according to Tania Racho, a legal expert and researcher of European law at Paris-Saclay University.In several non-EU countries, for example in Ukraine, Russia, Cyprus or Georgia, commercial surrogacy is explicitly permitted by law. However, in Ukraine, while the practice is accessible to foreigners, only married and heterosexual couples can sign a contract with a surrogate. The situation used to be quite similar in Russia until December 2022 (here, here), when new legislation was passed banning foreigners from having children with the help of a surrogate.While surrogacy and its implications are not directly addressed in Slovak legislation, Act no. 36/2005 Coll. -- the so-called Law on the Family -- strictly sets out that ""the mother of the child is the woman who gave birth to the child"".The situation in the Czech Republic is in a legal grey area as it is neither explicitly permitted, nor prohibited. The tolerated practice in the Czech Republic is for the surrogate mother to bear the child for the biological parents and give up her parental rights following the birth, but such action must not be compensated (here, here, here).The European Parliament has on multiple occasions condemned the practice of commercial surrogacy when adopting its annual report on human rights (in 2022, in 2015). As part of its 2022 resolution on the impact of the war against Ukraine on women, the EP also condemned ""the practice of surrogacy, which can expose women around the world to exploitation, in particular those who are poorer and are in situations of vulnerability, such as in the context of war"".In the United States, the practice is permitted in some states even in its commercial form (notably in California), but in other states, it is banned in all forms.Closer look at BelgiumThe legal situation in Belgium is similar to that of the Czech Republic in that there is no law specifically addressing surrogacy. Similar to the Czech Republic, altruistic surrogacy is not itself against the law and adoption by the intended parents after the child is born may be authorised under strict conditions.To better assess the legal situation of surrogacy in Belgium, we approached Catherine de Bouyalski, a lawyer who is one of the leading experts on the matter.""Belgium does not have any legislation on surrogacy. This means that it is not prohibited but it also means it is not regulated in any way. Moreover, in Belgium, a contract by which a woman would agree to give up her rights to the child she is carrying in advance to giving birth has no legal value,"" de Bouyalski said in an email to AFP.She also explained that commercial surrogacy is not legal: ""As the body is 'off the market', no contract can be concluded in which surrogacy services are provided in exchange for payment"". This is a reference to the right to respect for physical integrity of the person as enshrined, for example, in Article 3 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to de Bouyalski, exceptions to this principle are only possible in strictly planned and regulated cases, and always with an altruistic or gratuitous motivation, for example for organ donation.""Some Belgian hospitals and clinics practice surrogacy. In the absence of specific law, however, each provider decides how it wishes to regulate this process in compliance with all other applicable fundamental rules, of course. Most hospitals require that the intended parents come with a surrogate mother that they know, possibly related to them. Psychological and medical interviews are planned with the different protagonists before the hospital decides to accept or refuse the request. This process is intended to be as respectful as possible of everyone's rights,"" said de Bouyalski.When asked whether she has any knowledge of childrenâ€™s auctions, she replied: ""I have never heard of any 'auctions' of babies in Belgium. This would obviously be perfectly illegal. It seems to me that the articles and claims you sent me make shortcuts and try to bring a 'shock' value without any basis in reality. As far as I am concerned, all the cases which concerned surrogacy that I dealt with in my practice, were carried out legally in the respective country concerned.""Robert BARCAAll articlesAFP SlovenskoAll articlesFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU-Tunisia deal aims to tackle illegal migration,"The European Commission, the Netherlands and Italy agree on a migration deal with Tunisia. The Commission formally requests Austria to address shortcomings in its implementation of the Habitats Directive in the Hohe Tauern National Park in the province of Salzburg. Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov hopes his country will join the Schengen area in October.Belgium hails European migration deal with TunisiaTunis (Belga) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni travelled to Tunisia on Sunday to negotiate the last obstacles to a migration agreement with Tunisian President Kais Saied. In return for financial support, the Tunisian government will take measures to stop the illegal crossing of migrants.Many migrants leave Tunisia by boat for Europe, mainly Italy. Tunisia, which is in dire economic straits and desperately needs cash, could receive more than a billion euros in aid, some of which would be used to strengthen border controls and repatriate migrants.The deal will now be submitted to the EU member states. Belgium will ratify the agreement before it is finalised. ""It is absolutely necessary to reach agreements with the countries around the European Union,"" said Belgian State Secretary for Asylum and Migration Nicole de Moor on Monday morning.The European Commission wants to reach similar agreements with other countries around Europe. According to von der Leyen, the deal with Tunisia could serve as some kind of blueprint. But there is much criticism of the state of democracy and human rights in the North African country, as well as with regard to the authorities' handling of sub-Saharan migrants.De Moor says she is also concerned about the situation in Tunisia, ""but nobody is interested in abandoning Tunisia."" However, the Flanders Refugee Council is less enthusiastic about the deal. ""If the EU takes human rights seriously, it will not close the deal,"" stated policy officer Thomas Willekens on Monday. (17 July)EU Commission warns Austria over nature protection in Hohe Tauern National ParkBrussels (APA) – According to the European Commission, Austria is not properly implementing the Habitats Directive in the Hohe Tauern National Park in the province of Salzburg. The EU authority has therefore launched an infringement procedure, it announced on Friday. Austria has failed to take ""appropriate steps"" in recent years to prevent a ""significant deterioration of natural habitats"" and to regulate related economic activities.The central aim of Hohe Tauern National Park, the largest protected area in the Alps, was the ""preservation of a Europe-wide unique and species-rich high mountain landscape,"" the statement said. It was home to ""priority natural habitat types"" that were threatened with extinction. Despite ""well-documented evidence of a significant deterioration of natural habitats,"" Austria had done nothing about the economic activities that fuelled the problem, the statement added.According to the Brussels authority, Austria has also failed to comply with another aspect of the Habitats Directive. The requirement that any plan or project not directly related to the management of the site be assessed for its compatibility with the conservation objectives had not been properly transposed into national law, the Commission said. ""Numerous types of projects are not subject to any assessment according to the Salzburg National Park Act.""The Brussels authority has sent Austria a formal request to remedy these shortcomings. Austria has two months to respond satisfactorily to the letter of formal notice, otherwise the EU Commission may open infringement proceedings by issuing a so-called â€œreasoned opinionâ€. (14 July)Schengen enlargement does not only depend on Bulgaria and Romania, Denkov saidBucharest (BTA) – It is realistic for Bulgaria to join Schengen in October, Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov said after a meeting in Bucharest with his Romanian counterpart Marcel Ciolacu.â€œThe only problem is that not everything depends on our two countries,â€ Denkov said. He added that Bulgaria had to convince the Dutch and Austrian parliaments, which was a ""difficult but possible task.â€ Denkov stated that work was being done against organised crime networks involved in the smuggling of migrants. He added that efforts were underway with Europol, Frontex and several countries on the EU's eastern border, and that cooperation with Moldova was imminent. â€œWe are discussing extending this cooperation to Turkey. The idea is to put pressure on the organisers of these groups, to interrupt the channels,â€ the Bulgarian Prime Minister said.Romanian Prime Minister Ciolacu thanked the Spanish EU Presidency for its support of the extension of the border-free zone.Meanwhile, Bulgarian Deputy Prosecutor-General Maria Pavlova said that more than 300 migrants had been detained in Bulgaria in just one day.The General Directorate for Combating Organised Crime was monitoring 59 criminal groups with more than 250 members, said the director of the service, Yavor Serafimov.In 2020, there were 150 cases against traffickers in the country. In 2022, there were more than 1,000. More than 1,000 offenders have been convicted, but only about 20 per cent of those found guilty have been sentenced to three years in prison. (14 July)European Commission opens several proceedings against GermanyBrussels (dpa) – The European Commission has initiated three proceedings against Berlin, because it believes that Germany is not implementing EU law. One of the issues at stake is that there are allegedly too many obstacles in Germany to the recognition of midwives' professional qualifications, the Commission said in Brussels on Friday.A second case concerns ports. According to the Commission, complaints that have to be dealt with effectively in line with an EU regulation are not handled appropriately. This concerns, for example, complaints that the costs of port services such as refuelling may not be transparent at present. In the third case, the Commission said that Germany had failed to ensure that the requirements for a project on the better coordination of procedures in airspace were met.Berlin now has two months to respond to the charges. At the end of the so-called infringement proceedings, which have now been opened, there may be an action before the European Court of Justice and a fine. As guardian of the treaties, the Commission monitors member states' compliance with EU law. (14 July)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Fresh impetus for EU-CELAC relations, war in Ukraine remains sticking point","Leaders from the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean made progress during a two-day summit on trade deals and global investment between the regions. Discussions on technology, human rights and climate change took place. However, the 60 countries failed to unanimously condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.The third EU-CELAC summit in Brussels, to which over 30 leaders from Caribbean and Latin American nations were invited, was the first such meeting in eight years. It comes as the EU turns away from Russia and China as go-to trading partners and seeks to diversify its suppliers.On Monday, many leaders pledged to finalise the stalled free trade agreement between the EU and the Mercosur trading bloc of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay by the end of the year, despite unresolved concerns on environmental protection and unfair competition.Brussels has its eye on critical raw materials naturally occurring in Latin America that are in high demand in the EU and could help the bloc's transition away from fossil fuels, towards a more climate-friendly industry.In other developments, some Caribbean and Latin American leaders have refrained from imposing far-reaching sanctions on Russia. They repeatedly emphasised the consequences of the war for global food and energy prices and called for peace talks.New push for EU-Mercosur free trade dealA free trade agreement between the EU and the Mercosur states got a new push on Monday as leaders committed to swiftly finalising the long-stalled deal. The deal had been on hold since the conclusion of negotiations in 2019.Some EU member states had requested an addendum to the deal on climate, the environment, and human rights after deforestation in Latin America skyrocketed. ""Our ambition is to settle any remaining differences as soon as possible so that we can conclude this agreement,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.Whether the deal, under which one of the largest free trade areas with more than 700 million inhabitants could be created, will be finalised by the end of year remains unclear.Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar voiced opposition to the pending trade accord without new provisions on climate protection and deforestation. France, Germany and the Netherlands have expressed similar concerns in the past. The Austrian parliament voted in 2019 in a binding ballot against the trade deal over environmental and competition concerns.A balanced agreement between Mercosur and the European Union, which we intend to conclude this year, will open new horizons.Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, President of BrazilBrazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva stressed the importance of public procurement between the Mercosur trade bloc and the EU. â€œA balanced agreement between Mercosur and the European Union, which we intend to conclude this year, will open new horizons,"" Lula added. Argentinaâ€™s President Alberto FernÃ¡ndez also called for a balance in relations between the two continents, because otherwise ""it stops being an agreement and starts to be a joke"".In May, environmental activists climbed the EU Council building in Brussels to protest against the Mercosur trade deal. They held up banners reading 'Stop EU-Mercosur'. The environmentalists announced on Twitter: ""This agreement is a disaster for nature, farmers and human rights."" The EU has been in talks on an agreement with Mercosur since 1999. Obstacles to an agreement include demands for the Amazon rainforest to be protected from deforestation for livestock-keeping and also further development of agriculture to be halted.ACTION ACTION ACTION!Greenpeace activists are right now climbing the Europa Building in Brussels where EU trade ministers will meet later today to discuss the #EUMercosur trade dealThis deal is a disaster for nature, farmers and human rights - it's time to #StopEUMercosur pic.twitter.com/917UaPLuIY— Greenpeace EU (@GreenpeaceEU) May 25, 2023 De-couple from China, re-couple with CELACTo demonstrate Brusselsâ€™ renewed interest in the region, the EU has committed to spending over 45 billion euros by 2027 in investment plans for partners in South America and the Caribbean. This comes as part of the blocâ€™s so-called Global Gateway strategy, an initiative to link the bloc to the rest of the world and to rival China's spending in global infrastructure.The EU and its investment partners agreed to prioritise sectors from ""clean energy and critical raw materials to health and educationâ€œ, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday. Critical raw materials naturally occurring in Latin America are in high demand in the EU for the bloc's transition away from fossil fuels and towards a more climate-friendly industry. On the sidelines of the summit, Chile and the European Commission signed a partnership agreement to strengthen cooperation on the provision of raw materials to Europe.More than 135 projects on green and digital transition on both sides of the Atlantic are â€œalready in the pipelineâ€, according to von der Leyen. Other plans include an expansion of telecommunication networks in the Amazon in Brazil, 5G network development in Jamaica, the electrification of public transport in Costa Rica and investments in lithium mines in Argentina and Chile.Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon, standing in for Prime Minister Robert Golob, said she would aspire for more cooperation, including in the fight against climate change and AI. She pointed out the role of the Slovenian UNESCO Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which could become operational by the end of the year.While Croatia's interests in relations with the CELAC countries are in line with the EUâ€™s, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ cited the large number of Croatian diaspora in that part of the world as another motive for cooperation. ""To understand our position, it is important to keep in mind that, according to the estimates of our various departments, as many as 650,000 Croats live in the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean,"" PlenkoviÄ‡ said.Besides discussing potentials for strengthened economic cooperation, another key item on the summitâ€™s agenda was the EU member statesâ€™ desire to show solidarity with war-torn Ukraine.EU-CELAC summit. Photo: Dario Pignatelli/European Council/dpaRussia's allies deal blow to EUâ€™s Ukraine efforts European and CELAC leaders failed to agree on a statement holding Russia to account for the war in Ukraine, highlighting their differences over the crisis. In fact, the discrepancies had already begun prior to the summit, following Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez's invitation to his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelensky. Several Latin American countries vetoed his presence at the event, as Zelensky himself revealed.The joint communique issued after the summit concluded expressed ""deep concern"" about the conflict but contained no mention of Russia. The EU-27 and 32 out of the 33 CELAC supported the conclusions. Nicaragua did not back the final wording.Diplomats said Nicaragua, Cuba and Venezuela had opposed language criticising Russia, and other countries – while agreeing to support Ukraine's sovereignty – had stressed that different crises and conflicts were also worthy of the world's attention.""We cannot make this summit between the European Union and CELAC be a summit on Ukraine,"" said Ralph Gonsalves, CELAC president and Prime Minister of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. ""But clearly Ukraine is a matter of great importance to Europe and the world – other conflicts too,"" he said, referring to the crisis in Haiti, the Palestinian struggle for statehood and various wars in Africa as deserving of European attention.Here in Europe it's hard to imagine, but in Latin America, Russia is presented as a peaceful country that has been attacked by NATO.Mateusz Morawiecki, Prime Minister of Poland Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki was blunt, arguing that countries which once suffered from European colonialism should recognise that Russia is now an imperialist threat. ""Here in Europe it's hard to imagine, but in Latin America, Russia is presented as a peaceful country that has been attacked by NATO,"" he said.As the leaders met in Brussels, Russia refused to extend a deal to allow Ukrainian grain exports through the Black Sea, drawing a warning from the UN that millions of the world's poorest would ""pay the price"".On the subject of peace, during the summit plenary session, a warning also came from Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. ""We must give words the right meaning they have: the word peace cannot be confused with the word invasion. If anyone thinks they can confuse these two words they do not realise that a world in which international law no longer exists will never be a world of peace,â€œ she warned.Other topics discussed at the summit, which will now take place every two years, included the long-term impacts of slavery. In the final declaration all leaders ""acknowledge and profoundly regret the untold suffering inflicted on millions of men, women and children as a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.""This article is published weekly.

"No, Sweden is not quitting the European Green Deal","A German blog post shared on social media in June 2023 claimed that Sweden had withdrawn from the European Green Deal. While it is true that Swedenâ€™s new conservative government -- known for its pro-nuclear stance -- recently changed the national electricity mix target, it has not however announced that it was quitting the Green Deal, the Swedish finance ministry and the European Commission told AFP.""Sweden is withdrawing from the European Green Deal, abandoning the development of solar and wind energy and launching a nuclear programme,"" claimed a tweet that has been retweeted nearly 2,000 times since June 26.""Sweden says goodbye to the Green Deal! And (French President Emmanuel) Macron, what's he waiting for?"" read another tweet, while a Facebook post also applauded the decision allegedly taken by Sweden.Screeshots taken on Twitter (left) and Facebook (right) on June 30, 2023.What is the source of the claim?These posts include a screenshot of a German blog post entitled ""Sweden withdraws from the Green Deal and abandons green energy goals"".""The Swedish government... dealt a blow to the EU's Green Deal by abandoning green energy goals,"" the author wrote, referring to remarks by Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson to the Swedish parliament.""Wind and solar energy are too unstable"" to respond to the country's energy needs, she allegedly said, according to the blog post, which sourced the quote to a Reuters article from June 20, 2023 that was republished by European news website Euractiv.Headlined ""Sweden adopts '100% fossil-free' energy target, easing way for nuclear"", the article reported that the Swedish parliament voted to modify the country's energy mix target for 2040.While the finance minister was indeed quoted there as saying, ""We need more electricity production, we need clean electricity and we need a stable energy system,"" she did not mention the instability of wind and solar energy, as claimed by the blog post.Neither was there any mention of a Green Deal exit by Sweden in the remarks reported by Reuters. AFP was in fact unable to locate any trace of the ""wind and solar energy are too unstable"" quote mentioned by the German blog post.What are the facts?On June 20, the Swedish parliament adopted an amendment proposed by the government that sets a new electricity mix target for 2040. The target has gone from 100-percent renewable electricity to 100-percent fossil-free electricity.But that is in no way an official withdrawal from the Green Deal pact, as a European Commission spokesperson told AFP on June 28, 2023, explaining that Sweden had not announced any intention to do so.The press office of the Swedish finance ministry also denied that Sweden had withdrawn or planned to, according to a statement to AFP on June 29, 2023.The European Commission spokesperson said Sweden, which at the time held the rotating EU Council presidency, played an important role and made its voice heard in favour of the legislation and its finalisation. The spokesperson added however that resorting to nuclear energy is a national choice that does not go against the objectives of the European Green Deal.The Swedish Parliament, October 17, 2022 (archive). Photo AFP/Jonathan Nackstrand)Climate plan with carbon neutrality target for 2050Presented for the first time in December 2019, the Green Deal is a climate plan that is notably meant to make the continent climate neutral by 2050, reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and have three billion additional trees planted in the EU by 2030.""This is Europe's man on the moon moment,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said when presenting the roadmap for action featuring 50 practical steps.More than two years later, the essence of the plan has been adopted (carbon market reform, carbon border tax, end of combustion-engine vehicle sales), yet negotiations are stalled on other key points, including biodiversity, pesticides and farm pollution emissions.The European Commission spokesperson told AFP in June 2023 that various pieces of legislation were currently being adopted and approved by sector: energy, transportation, land use, etc.In this context, doubts have emerged regarding the EU's capacity to fulfil its objectives. On June 26, 2023, the European Court of Auditors said they saw the ""2030 climate and energy targets at risk"".""The EU's achievement of its 2020 climate and energy targets was partly due to external factors such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to reducing emissions,"" the EU auditors said, adding that they found ""little indication that actions to achieve 2030 climate and energy targets will be sufficient.""Their sources of concern include national plans that they believe are not ambitious enough to achieve the collective goal of energy efficiency set by the 27 countries for the EU.The EU member states had until June 30, 2023 to present updated drafts of their national plans regarding energy and climate for the 2021-2030 period to the European Commission. The plans will need to be finalised by mid-2024.  In Sweden, the objectives are featured in the government's climate plan that was sent to Brussels in 2020. Based on a table included in the official document, Sweden notably plans to cut its net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2045.Other objectives mentioned in the table include 50 percent of final consumption of energy to be covered by renewable sources in 2020 and 100 percent renewable electricity generation by 2040 -- which the table specifies is a target not a deadline for nuclear energy.Screenshot of the Swedish government's climate plan, taken on June 30, 2023.Things have changed since 2020. In October 2022, Sweden's conservative leader Ulf Kristersson was elected prime minister with unprecedented and influential support from the far-right, marking a new political era for the Scandinavian country.According to their roadmap, the governing coalition notably plans a revival of nuclear energy, which Sweden had reduced in recent decades.On June 20, the Swedish parliament adopted a new national target for the composition of electricity production for 2040. The new target is ""100-percent fossil-free electricity production"" in 2040, while the previous target had been ""100-percent renewable electricity production"" in 2040, according to the parliament website.According to energy data compiled by the Swedish Institute -- a public agency whose aim is to build interest and trust in Sweden around the world -- 75 percent of electricity production in Sweden comes from hydroelectric (43 percent) and nuclear (31 percent) power. The country currently has three nuclear plants. It adds that some 16 percent of electricity output comes from wind power, while combined heat and power plants account for around nine percent ""and these are mainly powered by biofuels"".  ""In 2021, around 60 percent of Sweden's energy production came from renewable sources,"" the site said.AFP FranceTous ses articlesClimatFacebook Twitter EmailEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Bosnia's path into the EU is troubled by internal divisions,"Bosnia and Herzegovina's journey towards EU membership reached a milestone last December when it received candidate status. Now, the country faces its biggest political crisis since the Dayton Peace Agreement that ended the war in the 1990s. After the general national elections last year, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) quickly established a new government and made a big step toward the European Union by receiving candidate status after many years of waiting. However, internal political issues caused institutional instability which has turned into the biggest political crisis since the Dayton Peace Agreement. It could destabilise the region and jeopardise the countryâ€™s Euro-Atlantic future.The agreement divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two entities: a Bosniak-Croat Federation and Republika Srpska (RS). They are connected by a weak central government.Bosnian Serb-leader Dodik on a collision course with international envoy SchmidtThe president of the Serb-majority entity Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, who remains a Kremlin ally, has held enormous sway over the countryâ€™s Serb entity for years and has frequently stoked ethnic tensions.In recent weeks, two controversial laws were signed by the Bosnian Serb president, both regarded as inflammatory political moves, which Washington said undermine the Dayton peace deal. Strong reactions also came from the Bosniak-Croat Federation as well as from Paris, Rome and Berlin.BiH Presidency member Denis BeÄ‡iroviÄ‡ said that Dodik ""openly threatens the Dayton Peace Agreement and the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and thus peace and security"".The first legislation signed into law by Dodik on July 7 suspends the Bosnian Serb entity's recognition of rulings made by Bosniaâ€™s constitutional court. The Constitutional Court of BiH (BiH CC) consists of nine judges, of which three are selected by the President of the European Court of Human Rights. The other four are selected by the Federation and two are selected by RS. Dodik is demanding that the foreign judges be replaced with domestic ones. In addition, he claims that the immovable property in RS is Bosnian Serb property and not the stateâ€™s. According to Dodik, the rulings of the BiH CC will not be applied in RS until the court is reformed.The second piece of legislation effectively allows the Bosnian Serb entity to bypass or ignore decisions made by the top international envoy to BiH, Christian Schmidt. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on July 8 tweeted that Dodik's signing of a law rejecting the international envoyâ€™s authority ""violates the Bosnia and Herzegovina constitution and undermines the Dayton Accords"". The US embassy in Sarajevo called the law ""a deliberate attack on the Dayton Peace Agreement.""https://twitter.com/SecBlinken/status/1677447626059399173On July 9, both bills, which were approved by Bosnian Serb lawmakers last month, officially entered into force with their publication in the official gazette of Republika Srpska (RS).Schmidt strongly criticised the Bosnian Serb authorities, speaking of an ""attack on the Bosnian Constitutional Court"" and an ""attempt to threaten the country's legal and constitutional framework, including key elements such as the decisions of the High Representative.""  He added: ""The political representatives of RS are trying to threaten the rule of law and create chaos. From now on all actions that violate the constitutional order of Bosnia and Herzegovina will be treated as a criminal offence. And those responsible will be prosecuted."" The new measure would allow Bosniaâ€™s judiciary to prosecute politicians who oppose Schmidtâ€™s orders and those of the constitutional court with punishments running up to five years in jail.Bosnia's international envoy is currently the German diplomat Christian Schmidt. He has executive powers - the so-called Bonn powers - notably to sack elected officials and impose laws. Photo: Hazim AljoviÄ‡/FENA Dodik, however, appeared defiant and lashed out at Schmidt in a letter sent to the High Representativeâ€™s office on Friday afternoon. ""The high representative in Bosnia does not exist and it is disgusting and illegal to misrepresent yourself,"" wrote Dodik.The Bosnian Serb leader has refused to recognise Schmidt's authority since the position lost the backing of the United Nations due to an intervention by Moscow and Beijing.Milorad Dodik has good relations with the authorities in Serbia and in his statements, he does not hide that he counts on the support of official Belgrade for his views, which have met with condemnation from the West. On April 24, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ commented that he never said anything against BiH and its integrity. "" I look to preserve regional peace and stability in every possible way,"" VuÄiÄ‡ said.On July 2, Dodik, who has long campaigned for secession, announced a possible referendum this year on the status of Republika Srpska.Path towards authoritarianismOn July 20, the Bosnian Serb parliament passed a law to make defamation a criminal offence. Critics say the move is aimed at silencing critical voices in the Bosnian Serb entity. The US embassy in Sarajevo warned that ""those who introduced and supported this repressive legislation have moved the Republika Srpska one step further down the path toward authoritarianism,"" adding it was also jeopardising the countryâ€™s Euro-Atlantic future.Is Dodik threatening Bosniaâ€™s EU path?The National Assembly of the RS ""does not have the authority to decide not to apply the decisions of the Constitutional Court of BiH,"" said a spokeswoman for the European External Action Service, adding that the vote ""is therefore without legal basis"" and marks ""a clear departure from the expectations that accompanied the granting of EU candidate status"".""To suspend cooperation in the achievement of key EU priorities is regrettable,"" the spokeswoman continued. ""The EU,"" she concluded, ""has consistently demonstrated that it is a loyal partner of Bosnia and Herzegovina with an unequivocal commitment to the country and its prospect of EU membership as a single, united and sovereign country.""The leader of the Croatian ethnic group in BiH, the president of the partyâ€™s BiH Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ BiH) and of the Croatian National Assembly (HNS BiH), Dragan ÄŒoviÄ‡, pointed out that the majority of the package agreed with the EU Enlargement Commissioner OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi should be implemented by October. He stressed that this would include the Electoral Law as well as the reform of the Constitutional Court of BiH.The Electoral Law has been the subject of debate for years. Croatiaâ€™s officials stressed that it is necessary to remove all provisions in the constitution that discriminate against national minorities and to ensure the equality of the three constituent nations in BiH. The Croatian representative Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡ has so far been elected to the three-member presidency by the non-Croat majority in four elections.As a result, Croats are seeking a provision in the constitution and in the Electoral Law that would make it impossible for one ethnicity to elect another nation's representatives. This was partially supported by the High Representative who imposed an electoral reform on the eve of the election. Critics say that such moves lead to further institutional fragmentation and are aimed mainly at securing the victory of the Christian-Democrat party HDZ in the Croat constituencies.Can EU negotiations start by the end of the year?Last week, the EU-Bosnia and Herzegovina Stabilisation and Association Council took place in Brussels for the first time after the country was given candidate status last December. It reviewed the countryâ€™s progress.Croatia emphasised that it was in its interest to have a functional and stable Bosnia and Herzegovina in its neighbourhood. Foreign Minister Gordan GrliÄ‡ Radman said on July 19 that Croatia would advocate the opening of negotiations on BiH's accession to the European Union by the end of this year.Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said she believed Bosnia and Herzegovina was well on track after being granted candidate status last year, something that Slovenia had been lobbying hard for.""Considering the country has formed government structures at all levels very rapidly, the fastest in its history (...), we expect now that it will implement reforms very ambitiously. The goal is that accession talks start by the end of the year,"" the minister said. She added that a large part of the key priorities had yet to be met.No EU sanctions against Bosnian Serb leader DodikThe Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik. Photo: FENAOn July 12, the European Parliament called for targeted sanctions against Milorad Dodik, who is already sanctioned by the United States and the United Kingdom, and other high-ranking officials of Republika Srpska, for secessionist actions in the country.The report on BiH, which was approved by 530 votes to 68 with 33 abstentions, strongly denounced the 'recurring inflammatory rhetoric and secessionist laws and policies of the RS' leadership. The MEPs warned that ""more than 25 years after the war has ended, the country is still facing divisions promoted by political elites and secessionist attempts"" by the RS. Such actions are destabilising BiH, contradicting its EU perspective and jeopardising access to EU funding, the report stated. Finally, MEPs urged BiH to strengthen its preparation for EU accession negotiations.However, Hungary expressed its opposition to the imposition of sanctions on Dodik. Speaking in Banja Luka on July 5, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto expressed full support for the Bosnian Serb leader. ""We support Dodik and stand by him for you, for the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, because you have decided that he is your president.""This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Greece ravaged by wildfires,"Slovakia sends firefighters to the Greek island of Rhodes to fight a forest fire. The first European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence opens in Slovenia. No party won a clear majority in Sunday's general elections in Spain.Slovak firefighters help fight forest fire on the island of RhodesBratislava (TASR) – Slovak firefighters were deployed to fight a forest fire on the Greek island of Rhodes. They arrived in Athens on Friday morning, spokeswoman KatarÃ­na KriÅ¾anovÃ¡ of the Slovak Presidium of the Fire and Rescue Corps (HaZZ) confirmed. On Saturday, the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs announced that the Greek rescue forces had evacuated several Slovak citizens from the fire-hit areas of Rhodes.Prime Minister Ä½udovÃ­t Ã“dor is in intensive contact with the foreign ministry. ""The situation is being closely monitored and coordinated with travel agencies. If the situation requires it, we are ready to immediately send a government aircraft to Rhodes,"" Interior Ministry spokeswoman Zuzana EliÃ¡Å¡ovÃ¡ said on Sunday. However, she added that the situation regarding the fire on the Greek island of Rhodes did not require the dispatch of a government special for the time being. (24 July)First European School on Artificial Intelligence opens in LjubljanaLjubljana (STA) – The European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence is underway until Friday at the Faculty of Computer Science and Informatics in Ljubljana, with courses and lectures by world-renowned experts. This is the first edition of the European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence, which is the result of the merger of the summer school organised by the European TAILOR project over the last two years and the long-standing Advanced Course on Artificial Intelligence (ACAI).This year's Summer School will feature lectures by top experts from Stanford, Yale, Washington, Oxford, Cambridge, KU Leuven, TU Darmstadt, Sapienza in Rome, CNRS in France, as well as from companies such as Google DeepMind, Microsoft and VMware Research.According to Vida Groznik of the University of Ljubljana, head of the local organising committee, the conference will be attended by over 570 participants from all parts of Europe, North and Latin America and Asia.As Groznik explained, recent talk in the field of artificial intelligence has focused largely on language models such as Chat GPT, and the event is intended to present the full scope of artificial intelligence. As such, the event will offer 36 courses that will showcase the full diversity of AI. (24 July)Divided Spain leaves future of the government in limboMadrid (EFE) – Spaniards left the future of their country in suspense after Sunday's general elections, in which neither the right-wing nor the left-wing bloc won a sufficient majority to govern, meaning that pacts will play a key role for both groups.Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o's conservative Popular Party (PP) was the winner with 136 seats, with more than 99 percent of the votes counted, while the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) of the now Acting Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez won 122 seats. Santiago Abascal's far-right Vox lost 19 seats in these elections, leaving it with 33 deputies in Congress, while Sumar, the left-wing coalition led by the second Vice-President of the government and Minister of Labour, Yolanda DÃ­az, came in fourth with 31 seats, four seats less than its predecessor Unidas Podemos had won in the previous elections.With these results, neither of the two left/right blocs have an absolute majority, which in Spain is set at 176 seats.Among the Catalan pro-independence parties, ERC suffered a severe setback, falling from 13 to seven deputies, while Junts per Catalunya lost one deputy and is now left with six. Meanwhile, the Basque pro-independence party EH-Bildu overtook the Basque Nationalist Party (PNV) for the first time, with six deputies compared to five. Despite declines, these parties could still hold the key to forming a government.Voter turnout in these elections was 70.18 per cent, almost four points higher than in the general election of 10 November 2019, when it was 66.23 per cent, according to official data. This increase was influenced by the postal vote of 2.4 million voters, a historic figure in Spanish democracy, due to the holiday period in which these elections were held. (23 July)Von der Leyen: The migration agreement with Tunisia is a model for othersRome (Tanjug) – The EU's migration agreement with Tunisia could serve as a model for other countries, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She stressed that the EU was fighting to stop the flow of illegal migrants across the Mediterranean.Last week, the EU and Tunisia signed a ""strategic partnership agreement"" that includes cracking down on people smugglers and tightening border controls. ""We want our agreement with Tunisia to be a model and a plan for future partnerships with other countries,"" von der Leyen told a conference in Rome.Illegal flows of migrants were damaging Mediterranean countries, said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, calling for a joint fight against human traffickers. Contrary to previous hardline rhetoric, Meloni stated during her presentation in Rome that her government was open to accepting more refugees who came legally, pointing out that ""immigration is needed both in Italy and in Europe.""""Mass illegal immigration harms everyone. It only benefits criminal groups who enrich themselves at the expense of the weakest and use their power even against governments,"" Meloni warned.In addition to the EU-Tunisia deal on migration, agreements have also been reached under which the EU will invest money in digitalisation, the modernisation of education and sustainable energy projects in Tunisia, among other things. Brussels wants to reach agreements of this kind with several countries, which was confirmed by Meloni, who called it ""a new model of relations with countries in North Africa."" (23 July)Habeck stresses need for free trade agreement with IndiaNew Delhi (dpa) – German Economy Minister Robert Habeck has stressed the need for a free trade agreement between the EU and India, but expects complicated negotiations. India is currently not the only country the EU is negotiating free trade agreements with and, in New Delhi on Thursday, the Green politician said that the agreement with India would certainly be one of the most difficult. ""That has to be said, because India has a tradition of protecting its market,"" Habeck stated. ""That would have to be overcome."" Conversely, India also demands a lot from Europe, such as easier access to patents.""With regard to the details, interests do not necessarily run parallel,"" Habeck said. The trade deal was complicated, he added. ""That is why it has taken so long and no progress has been made. At the same time, we have to see what opportunities are now involved and what needs to be done. And that is why I am very much in favour of putting more effort into it now.""During a visit to India in February, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz had said that he wanted to speed up the negotiations on the free trade agreement between the EU and India. ""I am in favour of developing more pressure now, of developing a strong will,"" he said at the time after talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi.The EU and India have been trying to reach a free trade agreement for years. Negotiations took place from 2007 to 2013, but failed. From Germany's point of view, the obstacles included protective measures for the Indian car sector. Negotiations resumed last year.

Europe in brief: European Parliament to increase number of MEPs,"In the run-up to the 2024 EU elections, the European Parliament seeks to increase its number of seats. The European Ombudsman wants to investigate Frontex's role in a deadly shipwreck off the coast of Greece. France and Austria want to prepare the European Union for the accession of new members.Belgium may gain additional MEPBrussels (Belga) – Belgium may gain an extra seat in the European Parliament in the 2024 elections. On Wednesday, EU ambassadors agreed on the composition of the parliament between 2024 and 2029, the Spanish presidency announced on Twitter.The European treaty stipulates that the European Parliament should have a maximum of 750 members and a president. There are currently 705 seats, including 21 for Belgium, but the European Parliament wants to increase the total number of seats to 716 after the June 2024 elections, to take into account the latest population figures.In the Parliament's proposal, Belgium would remain at 21 seats, but the member states themselves were also given a say. Belgium had announced earlier that it would demand one to two more seats.The EU ambassadors of the member states have now agreed on their suggestion for the composition of the Parliament after 2024. According to the Dutch news agency ANP, Belgium, along with Poland, Austria, Denmark, Finland, Slovakia, Ireland, Slovenia and Latvia, would be allowed to elect an extra MEP – if the Council's proposal were to be implemented. The Netherlands would get two more, as would Spain and France. This would expand the European Parliament to 720 seats.EU diplomats expect that the Parliament will accept these adjustments to its proposal. Either way, time is pressing: European elections will be held in June of next year, and many member states will soon begin preparations. (26 July)EU Ombudsman questions FrontexBrussels (dpa) – Following the shipwreck in Greece, in which several hundred people died, the European Ombudsman Emily O'Reilly wants to investigate the role of the EU border agency Frontex. ""It has been reported that in this instance Frontex alerted the Greek authorities to the shipâ€™s presence and offered assistance, but it is not clear what else it could or should have done,"" O'Reilly announced in Brussels on Wednesday. While the role of the Greek authorities was being investigated at national level, the role of Frontex also needed to be clarified, she said.According to the statement, the ombudsman has asked for the formal report on what happened and details of how information on search and rescue operations is shared between Frontex and national authorities. Other questions include the use of boat-mounted cameras during joint operations.Many migrants attempt life-threatening crossings to Europe on boats that are often not seaworthy. There have been a number of serious boat accidents. In mid-June, for example, hundreds of migrants attempting to cross from Libya to Italy drowned when an overcrowded fishing boat sank about 50 nautical miles off the Greek coast. Frontex has repeatedly been accused by NGOs of failing to adequately protect the rights of refugees. (26 July)France and Austria to prepare EU for enlargementVienna (APA) – France and Austria want to prepare the European Union for the accession of new members. ""The real question is the 'how' of enlargement, the changes we have to aim for in the EU budget as well as in the institutions,"" French Secretary of State for Europe Laurence Boone said after a meeting with Austrian European Affairs Minister Karoline Edtstadler in Vienna on Tuesday.""These issues will set the course for the political agenda after the European Parliament elections in 2024,"" Edtstadler said, according to a statement published by the Austrian chancellery. ""We need a new vision for the enlargement process,"" the minister stated. ""Given the geopolitical realities, we need to adapt the process. It is important to maintain a merit-based approach to EU accession,"" Edtstadler urged.Boone stressed that it was important for her to exchange views ahead of important meetings at European level in late 2023 and 2024. ""We agree that we need to prepare the EU to welcome new members. We also need answers to the current challenges, both in terms of strategic autonomy and economic security. For France, it's not a question of if or when the EU should be enlarged – it should happen as soon as possible.â€The EU is currently negotiating accession with Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia. EU membership negotiations with Turkey have been stalling for years, and Ankara has called for talks to be resumed. Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ukraine and Moldova also have official EU candidate status. Kosovo and Georgia are considered potential EU candidates.

The EU has not banned domestic livestock,"Since mid-June 2023, thousands of social media users have shared an article in Bulgarian spreading the false claim that the EU has ""banned domestic cattle"", as well as other kinds of livestock. The article also claims the EU has prohibited the domestic production of dairy products and eggs. Both a European Commission spokesperson and the Bulgarian agriculture ministry said the claims are false. AFP did not find any information to suggest that such a ban is currently being considered at a European or a national level in Bulgaria.â€œRESISTANCE: EU BANS DOMESTIC CATTLE! IN BULGARIA, SQUADS ARE MARCHING ON HOUSES AND YARDS TO REMOVE LIVESTOCK!â€, the headline of a blog article reads. The article also claims that the ban would enter into force from July 1, 2023. It alleges that on this date special inspections will start and those who still have pigs, cows, or poultry will be fined and the animals confiscated. The post also claims that as part of the supposed new legislation, the EU has forbidden the production of homemade dairy products and eggs. According to the social media analysis tool CrowdTangle, the post has been shared over 2,400 times on Facebook since June 10, 2023, including here.Screenshot of a publication, taken on July 25, 2023However, the claims in the post are not true. No EU banThe EU has a common agriculture policy (CAP) for all countries in the bloc, and the sector is considered one of the most integrated in the Union. â€œLet us be very clear here: the European Commission has not banned domestic cattle or homemade dairy products or eggs, and has no intention to do soâ€, a Commission spokesperson told AFP in an email received on July 6, 2023.â€œAll CAP Strategic Plans apply from 2023 to 2027, so it is clear that the Commission will not ban cattle or dairy products and eggs in any possible way,â€ the spokesperson explained to AFP. The EC spokesperson pointed out that according to Bulgariaâ€™s CAP Strategic plan (archived here) the country is not considering cutting domestic cattle numbers and has actually decided to give livestock breeders income support.According to another measure in Bulgariaâ€™s CAP Strategic Plan, livestock farmers who voluntarily reduce livestock on their land and suffer from economic difficulties as a result will be compensated ""for their possible loss of income with 170â‚¬ per hectare,"" the EC spokesperson said, adding that ""any reduction of animals or production is completely voluntary"" and that ""no such request is being made by the European Commission"".Asked whether there were any plans to ban domestic livestock, pigs and cattle, the press centre of the Bulgarian Agriculture Ministry told AFP in an email received on July 6, 2023 that â€œthese statements are not trueâ€. In Bulgaria, a 2006 ordinance sets out the veterinary health requirements for livestock breeding. The ordinance was amended at the end of June 2023 but the amended text in no way prohibits the keeping of domestic animals. The official aim of the amendments is to ensure animal welfare requirements are adhered to, for example by setting ""minimum housing and feeding levels"" for ruminants, i.e. animals such as cattle and sheep.A rooster and a hen in a yard in Bukhovo, 25 km northeast of Sofia, Bulgaria, on July 22, 2023 (Nikolay DOYCHINOV) In an email to AFP on July 26, 2023, the press centre for the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency (BFSA) said there was ""no ban on keeping livestock"" domestically. It added that contrary to the claims in the false article, ""no checks on compliance"" with the ban are taking place since it does not exist.On July 22, 2023, an AFP reporter confirmed that domestic animals like poultry can be seen in peopleâ€™s yards in a small town near Sofia, weeks after the supposed ban was meant to come into effect.EU law not relevant for home-produced foodThe post also claims that the EU has forbidden domestic production of dairy products, cheese or eggs.However, food production for domestic use is not in the scope of EU regulation. â€œPreamble 9 of Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 states: 'Community rules should apply neither to primary production for personal domestic use nor to the domestic preparation, handling or storage of food for personal domestic consumptionâ€, Gergana Kabaivanova told AFP in a message on July 25, 2023. Kabaivanova is the founder of the Localfood.bg/Pendara Foundation, which promotes the consumption of sustainably grown local food. The control of food production is regulated by the Bulgarian Agency for food Safety, under the umbrella of the Bulgarian agriculture ministry. In the same email to AFP dated July 6 the press centre of the ministry denied the claim that the domestic production of dairy products and eggs is forbidden.Ð Ð¾ÑÐµÐ½ Ð‘Ð¾ÑÐµÐ²All articles (in Bulgarian)AFP Ð‘ÑŠÐ»Ð³Ð°Ñ€Ð¸ÑAll articlesFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

"Europe in brief: No negotiations after Spain’s snap elections between Sánchez and conservative PP
","The Spanish snap election, which took place during the countryâ€™s EU presidency, was the focus of this weekendâ€™s news attention as no new government was formed. Also: German right-wing party Alternative for Germany (AfD) began drawing up its list of candidates for the 2024 European elections over the weekend. Unlike France and the European Union, Belgium will not suspend development aid to Niger. Madrid (EFE) – Spain's acting head of government and socialist leader, Pedro SÃ¡nchez, seems to remain confident about his renewed inauguration. He refuses to meet with the president of the conservative Popular Party (PP), Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, until the Spanish Congress is constituted on 17 August, and King Felipe VI proposes who should form the government.SÃ¡nchez communicated his stance in a reply to a letter sent on Sunday by FeijÃ³o, in which he asked to meet with SÃ¡nchez next week to discuss and avoid a political ""blockade and the ungovernability"" of Spain. The socialist leader not only rejected a meeting, but also reminded FeijÃ³o of the deadlines set by the Spanish Constitution for forming a government.The Socialists donâ€™t believe NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o is able to form a government. If FeijÃ³o takes steps to do so before the king calls for consultations, the sources consulted by EFE assure that SÃ¡nchez will not stand in the way of Felipe VI's decision to propose him as a candidate. Crucial to this decision would be the time frame, because if two months pass without anyone being inaugurated, parliament will be dissolved and a new ballot will be held. (30 July) German right-wing AfD candidates want to make Europe a â€œfortressâ€Magdeburg (dpa) – German right-wing party AfD has filled the top spots on its list of candidates for the European elections with politicians who want to turn Europe into a â€œfortressâ€ against migrants. This was needed â€œto protect our homeland, and we are doing this together with our European partners,â€ said party co-leader Alice Weidel at the partyâ€™s European Election Assembly in the East German city of Magdeburg on Saturday. According to the President of Germany's domestic intelligence service, Thomas Haldenwang, â€œright-wing extremist conspiracy theoriesâ€ were spread at the event.Saxon MEP Maximilian Krah was elected as the top candidate with 65.7 percent approval. His candidacy was also supported by the partyâ€™s far-right camp. Krah is considered controversial within the AfD. In the European Parliament, the right-wing group Identity and Democracy (ID), suspended him for three months at the beginning of the year, due to an allegation that Krah had manipulated the parliamentary groupâ€™s awarding of a PR contract. Krah accused his internal party opponents of having waged an anonymous smear campaign against him for months. The lawyer has been a member of the European Parliament since 2019.Haldenwang told German press agency dpa that while it was true that the list of candidates and the election program had not yet been finally voted on, â€œit is already clear that people who have stood out in the past with positions that are not compatible with our liberal democratic constitution will be part of the AfD delegation in the upcoming European Parliament.â€ Haldenwang added that â€œso far, the AfDâ€™s European Election Assembly, which we are handling as a suspicious case, once again proves our assessment that there are strong anti-constitutional tendencies within the party, whose influence continues to increase.â€The AfD Federal Executive Committee wants to elect a total of at least 30 candidates. The top 15  were filled by Sunday evening, after which the European Election Assembly was halted and is to be continued next Friday. The election program will only be decided after the lists have been drawn up.It is possible that the program will only be discussed at an additional meeting, which would have to take place in January at the latest. Only then will it become clear whether the AfD will demand to radically reform the European Union so that more decisions will be taken at a national level again. However, the â€œDexitâ€ camp, which advocates Germany leaving the EU, could also prevail. Another point of contention is likely to be the stance on NATO.The â€œSolidarity Magdeburgâ€ alliance protested against the AfD meeting in Magdeburg on Saturday. (30 July)Belgium does not suspend development aid to Niger, but stops military cooperationBrussels (Belga) – Unlike France and the European Union, Belgium will not suspend development aid to Niger, Minister of Development Cooperation Caroline Gennez said in a radio programme on Sunday. â€œWe support the local population in terms of development cooperation. Our projects are about education for girls, about sustainable agriculture, about health care,â€œ the minister said.This is in contrast to France and the EU, among others, who directly supported Nigerâ€™s government. The total budget is 65 million euros, to be invested in livestock, public health, education and climate from 2022.Belgium also cooperated with the military of Niger. For example, Belgian soldiers trained some of the local forces to assist them in the fight against jihadists. However, that cooperation will be suspended, Gennez emphasized.On Wednesday, a coup took place in Niger, ousting democratically elected President Mohamed Bazoum from power. General Abdourahamane Tchiani proclaimed himself the new leader. After Mali and Burkina Faso, Niger is the third Sahel country to experience a coup since 2020.

Europe in brief: Germany plans to build hydrogen and gas-fired power plants,"Germany plans to build new hydrogen and gas-fired power plants while offering government incentives. As the European Commission continues its search for a new chief economist, it has set its sights on an Austrian candidate. The EU warns Italy to comply with international rules on rescuing at sea.New power plants for energy transition – Habeck achieves ""breakthrough"" with EUBerlin/Hamburg (dpa) – The German government's plan to restructure the country's electricity system is based primarily on renewable energies from wind and solar power – but in addition, new hydrogen and gas-fired power plants are to be built for ""dark lulls."" Robert Habeck (Greens), Germany's Minister for Economic Affairs and Climate Protection, is planning a power plant strategy to provide state incentives for this.The subsidies have to be approved by the European Commission. Habeck and the Commission have now agreed on ""guard railsâ€, according to a statement issued by the Economics Ministry in Berlin on Tuesday. In Hamburg, Habeck spoke of a ""political breakthrough"" on the way to CO2-free power plants. Investment subsidies were planned, he said. The next step is a consultation phase, which is due to start at the end of the summer. The subsidy process will then be continued with the European Commission.The German government's aim is for 80 percent of the electricity consumed in Germany to come from renewable sources by 2030, compared with just over half at present. There were always times when wind and sun were not sufficient, said Habeck. That's when ""controllable"" power plants should kick in as a ""backup"" to meet electricity demand. Security of supply will always be the top priority. Investment subsidies for the new power plants are likely to run into billions. In addition, fossil fuel plants are likely to become increasingly unprofitable as the price of CO2 rises.The details of the subsidies have not yet been decided. According to Habeck, the goal is ""green"" hydrogen, produced on the basis of renewable energies. But ""blue"" hydrogen was also better than natural gas or coal. This would involve capturing the carbon dioxide produced by fossil fuels and storing it underground, for example in former gas and oil reservoirs. Power plants also had the option of using ""blue"" hydrogen imported from Norway, for example, Habeck said.The energy industry welcomed Habeck's basic agreement with the European Commission. The industry has been waiting a long time for a power plant strategy and incentives for investment. Timm Kehler, chairman of the lobby group Zukunft Gas, said the details of the tenders had to be worked out quickly now. Without the construction of new power plants, there would be a shortfall in regulated power generation capacity of at least 15 gigawatts by 2030, he stated. ""We can therefore not afford any further delay, otherwise it will become increasingly difficult to achieve the coal phase-out targeted for 2030."" FDP energy policy expert Konrad Stockmeier said the coal phase-out could not be achieved without the massive addition of flexible ""H2-ready gas-fired power plants.""For the Rhenish coalfields, the German government and energy company RWE have agreed to bring forward the coal phase-out by eight years to 2030. Habeck wants the same for East Germany's lignite mining areas, but there is resistance. (1 August)Austrian Florian Ederer a strong contender for top EU jobBrussels/Strasbourg (APA) – Austrian economist Florian Ederer, who currently teaches at Boston University, is considered a strong candidate for a top job at the European Commission. Ederer confirmed to APA on Wednesday that he had received ""informal inquiries about my availability as chief economist"" from the European Commission. Brussels is looking for a new Chief Competition Economist, following the departure of controversial American Fiona Scott Morton.Ederer has been living and teaching in the US for several years. After eleven years as Associate Professor of Economics at prestigious Yale University, he joined Boston University as Professor of Management in July. He was ""very interested"" in the post, but there were other ""very good candidates,"" Ederer stressed. A Commission spokeswoman also confirmed that no decision had been taken and none was to be expected until after the summer at the earliest, as a selection process would have to take place before then.The Commission is looking for a new chief economist for the influential Directorate General for Competition. It is responsible for enforcing rules to ensure fair competition in the single market. Its tasks include checking whether company mergers or the granting of state aid restrict free competition.As US companies could also be affected, there were concerns, particularly from France, about the US economist Fiona Scott Morton. Conflicts of interest were feared, as she herself was said to have advised some large companies. As a result, Scott Morton resigned from her post. (2 August)EU warns Italy to 'respect international rules on sea rescues'Brussels (ANSA) – ""The rules included in Decree-Lawâ€, which also introduced new rules for NGOs, â€œneed to be interpreted andÂ  implemented in compliance with international law."" This was written by EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson in response to a question from more than 30 MEPs of different nationalities and political colours on the Italian government's rules on sea rescue operations. Assistance at sea ""is an obligation established by international maritime law,"" Johansson stressed, pointing out that the reminder applies â€œincluding when private vessels systematically carry out search and rescue activities.In the question, signed by Socialists and Democrats (S&D), Liberals (Renew), Greens and the Radical Left, MEPs question Italian rules that ""requires civilian rescue ships to immediately proceed to a designated port, often a distant port, after each rescue, which delays search-and-rescue operationsâ€, also citing some estimates of rescues provided by MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res.""Within its competences and mandate"" Johansson replied, ""the Commission is in close and regular contact with the Italian authorities and continues toÂ  follow closely the effective implementation"" of the Decree in question. In addition to respecting the international obligation to rescue at sea, the Commissioner also recalls that â€œin line with the EU acquis, it is the responsibility of Member States to ensure that any person present in their territorial waters has effective access to the asylum procedure and to ensure that applications are examined in accordance with Directive 2013/32/EU1.â€ (1 August).This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"Europe gripped by extreme weather, ‘era of global boiling has arrived’
","Record-breaking heatwaves and droughts, devastating wildfires, torrential rain and hailstorms all across Europe are costing lives, damaging infrastructure, diminishing biodiversity and hitting tourism, harvests and the economy. Some governments have imposed rules to ensure the safety of their workers and are calling for rigorous measures to combat climate change.
Heatwaves have simultaneously gripped three continents in the Northern Hemisphere this summer as global warming worsens. In Mediterranean countries especially favoured by tourists, such as Spain, Italy and Greece, temperatures have topped 40 degrees celsius in places, and further heatwaves are expected. The Mediterranean region has long been classified as a climate change hotspot by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).July is set to be the hottest month in thousands of years, climate scientists from the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) and the European Climate Change Service Copernicus reported after analysing data up to July 23.""We donâ€™t have to wait for the end of the month to know this. Short of a mini-Ice Age over the next days, July 2023 will shatter records across the board,â€ UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said, adding that ""the era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.""The era of global warming has ended; the era of global boiling has arrived.UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres Scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative said the heatwaves that have hit parts of Europe and North America in July would have been almost impossible without human-caused climate change.""We are seeing unprecedented changes all over the world,"" top NASA climatologist Gavin Schmidt said, with records being broken on land and at sea.Over the past year, more than 60,000 people have died in Europe due to extreme heat, according to Hans Kluge, the World Health Organisation's director for Europe, adding that the number of deaths from extreme heat ""is set to rise year-on-year.""Europe split in two extremesAlthough the weather in Germany and northern Europe this July felt less warm than in other summers, heatwaves in North America, Asia and southern Europe lifted the global average.Greece has been battling devastating wildfires driven by intense heat on the islands of Evia, Corfu and Rhodes. Thousands of people have been evacuated. According to the European Commission, European Union countries have been supporting Greece with almost 500 firefighters and seven planes deployed to different areas in the country.""Together, we are deploying available resources to fight the fires and protect our citizens and landscapes,"" EU Crisis Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ said in a statement. Countries worldwide can request help from EU members in case of a disaster, with the European Commission coordinating the deployment of civil protection equipment and experts.Aside from Greece, other countries in Europe such as Turkey, Spain, Portugal, Italy and France are also facing abnormally sweltering temperatures. In Turkey, temperatures around the Aegean and Mediterranean Sea are up to 8 degrees above the usual level for this time of year, according to the weather service. Fires caused landmines to explode near the southern Croatian city of Dubrovnik, local media reported.Spain is suffering from drought after experiencing the second driest spring in 62 years. Photo: EFE/Jorge ZapataSo far this summer, Spain has avoided major fires but the country has suffered a drought caused by high temperatures and a months-long lack of rain. After experiencing the second driest spring in 62 years, several areas, such as the two most populated regions Andalusia and Catalonia, have been hit by critically low water levels in reservoir and other storage sites. Reservoirs in Andalusia were at 24 percent of their total capacity last week, while this week in Catalonia, internal basins barely reached 27 percent.Meanwhile, many European countries and regions experienced other extreme weather events, such as storms with extreme rainfall and wind.Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, saw floods and torrents caused by heavy rainfall in May and June which was followed by a first heatwave. Storms and strong winds have caused severe material damage particularly in the north, but also in the southern parts of Bosnia.While Slovenia was battling the worst fires in its history this time last year, 2023 has seen it face extremely severe storms with heavy rainfall, hail and gail-force winds. Serbia has equally been affected by storms and hail which damaged crops, infrastructure, cars and residential buildings.Italy experienced â€œone of the most complicated days in recent decades - rainstorms, tornadoes and giant hail in the north, and scorching heat and devastating fires in the centre and south,"" said Italian Civil Protection Minister Nello Musumeci. The country battled deadly and destructive fires in the south and equally fatal storms in the north which left at least seven people dead and caused severe damage to property, infrastructure and crops. Most of the fires were caused by arson, prosecutors said.Extreme temperatures affecting business, infrastructure and peoplesâ€™ safetyWith extremely high temperatures, the need for air conditioning has driven up electricity consumption which in some countries led to day-long or repeated power outages as well as damage to underground cables.The Maltese Hotel and Restaurant Association reported that frustrated guests had checked out of hotels because of the power cuts. Restaurants and supermarkets in the country had to throw away defrosted food while malfunctioning air conditioners caused Italian McDonaldâ€™s staff to strike. They complained that they had been ""suffocating"" in the ""intolerable"" 40-degree-plus temperatures in the outlets. Several farm labourers have died of heatwave-related causes in Italy, too. CGIL, Italyâ€™s biggest trade union, urged authorities to step up efforts to protect workers from the effects of the tropical temperatures that have hit the country. Maurizio Landini, CGILâ€™s leader, said ""the heatwave is increasing the risks to the health and safety of female and male workersâ€. He added that â€œthis is totally unacceptable.â€ As a result, the Italian government is now working on a protocol on heat risks and issues at Italian workplaces.The heatwave is increasing the risks to the health and safety of female and male workers.Maurizio Landini, leader of Italy's biggest trade union CGILIn Germany, the rains are affecting harvests of grain, fruit and vegetables. While the rainfall has forced grain farmers to interrupt their harvests again and again, fruit and vegetable growers are content. Torsten Krawczyk, president of the Saxon state farmers' association, said it had been the most expensive harvest ever. The costs for fertiliser, for example, were twice to three times as high. Significantly more money also had to be paid for labour and energy.Mitigating climate change, building resilience and protectionRecent extreme weather conditions have prompted governments across Europe to step up their civil protection efforts and take appropriate measures to protect their citizens. UN Secretary-General Guterres called on politicians to take immediate and drastic steps to curb climate change and Pope Francis also renewed his call for action to address the climate crisis in the face of extreme weather events.In response to water scarcity in Spain, the regional government of Catalonia has declared a situation of ""water exceptionality"" in most of its territory. In the almost 500 municipalities affected by the shortage - home to six million people - a restriction of 230 litres of water per inhabitant per day for domestic use has been imposed. A 40 percent reduction in water for agricultural use and a 15 percent cut for industry have also come into force.In May, the Spanish government approved measures to prevent accidents and deaths in outdoor work that may be affected by adverse weather such as heatwaves. Maltese authorities issued a heat warning urging people not to leave their homes between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m., the hottest hours of the day. Similarly, the Romanian Territorial Labour Inspectorate made it mandatory for employers to take measures to protect their employeesâ€™ health, such as reducing the intensity of physical activities, ensuring ventilation in the workplace, interspersing physically demanding work with less active duties and introducing more breaks out of the hot sun during working hours.A man cooling off during the heat wave. Governments are urged to put measures in place to prevent accidents and deaths related to heat. Photo: Angel Garcia/ZUMA Press Wire/dpaGerman Health Minister Karl Lauterbach (SPD) presented a heat protection plan in late July in a bid to halve the number of heat-related deaths this year, mainly by providing more public guidance on how to cope with hot weather. While some saw it as a good starting point, a health policy expert from the opposition conservative CDU Tino Sorge, accused Lauterbach of inappropriate alarmism as common sense should be the guiding principle for protection and prevention.Slovenia is warming faster than the global average due to its geography, with an average temperature rise of 2.2 degrees between 1980 and 2021. More investment in prevention would definitely be needed, said Environment Minister UroÅ¡ BreÅ¾an. He stressed that there was a particular need to safeguard water supplies. Business leaders and politicians have been pointing to the need for systemic measures to adapt to climate change as well as intervention to tackle the consequences.Italian Environment and Energy Security Minister Gilberto Pichetto said â€œthe government is already engaged on this front to ensure close coordination between all the implementing bodies, both in emergencies and ordinary periods.â€ However, he insisted that ""the main problem is not funding, but the spending mechanism and procedures"".Record breaking extreme weather not enough to convince some that climate change is realDespite the extreme weather in Italy, 34.7 percent of Italians believe there is excessive alarm about climate change, according to the Ital Communications-Censis report â€œDisinformation and fake news in Italy'â€ The report also showed that 16.2 percent of the overall population denies that climate change exists, with the percentage rising to 18.3 percent among the elderly and to 18.2 percent among the less educated.This article is published weekly.

TikTok is in the process of making changes to be in line with the European Digital Services Act.EU activates the Civil Protection Mechanism for SloveniaBrussels (STA) – The Civil Protection Mechanism (CPM) has been activated in Brussels at the request of Slovenia, which has been facing catastrophic floods since Friday, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ announced on Sunday. The list of needs, which mainly includes requests for heavy machinery, has already been forwarded to the EU Member States.""The first list of needs has already been dispatched to our member states, asking for mostly heavy machinery and engineering units to operate them,"" LenarÄiÄ announced. Slovenia has requested a total of 40 working machines – such as excavators – and 30 specialised watercourse management vehicles, both with engineering teams, as well as 20 prefabricated bridges through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. It has also requested satellite mapping to help national authorities assess the full extent of the damage.In addition, the Slovenian government has requested assistance through the NATO mechanism and will submit an application to the European Commission for assistance from the EU Solidarity Fund, which provides grants to member states in the event of natural disasters.Commissioner LenarÄiÄ added that Slovenia could also obtain assistance from other EU funds, including the European agricultural crisis reserve, which could provide support to cover the destruction of crops and farm machinery, as well as cohesion funds, the European Regional Development Fund and the Recovery and Resilience Facility.

European users will now have the option to no longer be sent what critics say are addictive personalised videos.TikTok announced on Friday that it will now give users in Europe the option to turn off the 'For You' feature, which allows people to watch videos based on their personal interests. They will instead be shown videos that are popular globally or domestically.TikTok also announced that it will now be easier for European users to report illegal content. Users under 17 in Europe will also no longer see ads.The new EU legislation is intended to better safeguard users' privacy and provide better protection against disinformation, advertising and harmful content. European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton had given the Chinese company until September to adjust its policy. Last month, he urged TikTok to move faster.Thanks to algorithms powered by artificial intelligence, TikTok is very popular among young people and has more than a billion users now. In Europe, TikTok is viewed suspiciously because the app is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company.ByteDance has always emphasised that it is not under the control the Beijing government Companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, X (formerly Twitter) and Wikipedia will also have to comply with European Digital Services Act (DSA) rules by September.

"No, this video does not show migrants under military escort from Libya to Italy","Social media users shared videos in June 2023 claiming that a convoy of thousands of migrants were on their way to Italy from Libya. Some of the posts, shared hundreds of times in Polish, claimed the Libyan armed forces assisted their crossing in an organised operation to ""invade Europe"". But an AFP investigation found the footage was filmed during an expulsion of migrants from Libya into neighbouring Egypt.As European Union members negotiate a new migrant pact for thousands of people seeking protection in Europe, false claims about migrant journeys to the continent continue to spread on social media. Migration has inflamed Polish political debate ahead of an autumn general election, as the nationalist government approaches the issue as an electoral trump card.The governing Law and Justice (PiS) party recently proposed holding a referendum on the question of welcoming refugees. Amid this tense political climate, videos showing thousands of men walking through a desert landscape under army escort began circulating, with captions claiming they were heading to Europe via Italy.""Direction: Libya to Italy, around 125,000 people. Armed soldiers guard the convoy and keep them going in the right direction. This practice was implemented top-down,"" reads a tweet posted on July 13, 2023 in Polish with a short video showing hundreds of men marching along a road under military escort. The tweet was retweeted nearly 260 times.Screenshot from Twitter taken July 18, 2023""All this is coordinated by the Libyan army,"" said a Facebook post with the same video, while a publication on Telegram read: ""2,500 illegal immigrants land on their way to Italy from Libya."" The video was also shared in English, Spanish,Â French, and Georgian.We found another similar video circulating on Facebook with the claim: ""Up to 500,000 refugees from Libya arrive in Italy"". It was also shared in Greek.Screenshot from Facebook taken July 18, 2023Some Facebook users posted both videos, which show a crowd escorted by the same security forces wearing sand-coloured uniforms and feature the same vehicles.In fact, AFP's research found that the videos show authorities in Libya rounding up thousands of mostly Egyptian nationals in late May and early June and taking them to the country's eastern border, as part of a wider crackdown on smugglers and migrants. Western and Arab-language media including the Associated Press (archive link), Reuters (archive link)Â andÂ  Al-Jazeera (archive link) published stories in early June about this wave of migrant expulsions carried out by Libyan security forces. The AP described 6,000 migrants being taken to the customs hangar of the Musaid crossing point with Egypt.The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) expressed its concern about the mass arbitrary arrest of migrants and asylum-seekers in Libya on its Twitter account on June 12. ""We are concerned about the mass arbitrary arrest of migrants and asylum-seekers across the country. Libyan authorities have arrested thousands of men, women and children from the streets and their homes or following raids on alleged traffickersâ€™ camps and warehouses,"" it said.Libya is a key crossing point for sub-Saharan migrants trying to reach Europe. The International Organization for Migration's Libya's Displacement Tracking Matrix programme identified 706,062 migrants in Libya from over 44 nationalities in February 2023. In January and February 2023, a total of 14,948 migrants arrived in Italy and Malta from Libya and Tunisia via the Central Mediterranean Sea.Libya is a divided nation with rival factions vying for power. Military commander Khalifa Haftar controls eastern Libya, including the border region with Egypt. The country has been in the grip of a major political crisis since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011, undermined by divisions between the country's east and west and foreign interference.Same Libyan security forces appear in both videosWith the reported Libyan expulsions in mind, we used reverse image searchÂ methods to find previous examples of the two videos with the same false claims that the migrants were headed for Italy. The oldest publications that we could find with videos that matched the Polish false claims were from a Twitter account with the handle @RadioGenova, which posted the firstÂ video on June 23, 2023 and the secondÂ on June 25, 2023. The English-language account purportedly based in Italy mainly posts anti-migrant videos.Screenshot from Twitter taken July 24, 2023The @RadioGenova posts have similar descriptions to the Polish tweet: ""Look, an army of 500,000 men ready to invade Italy from Libya. A real apocalypse. Stop the invasion, save Europe!""We then looked for similar videos on trustworthy Arabic-language social media accounts by typing in keywords and doing reverse image searches. We thus discovered a video with striking similarities to those in the false claims. It was posted on June 7 to Facebook by the press office of the Tarek Ben Ziyad (TBZ) brigadeÂ (archive link). This brigade is a militant organisation led by Saddam Haftar, Khalifa Haftarâ€™s son. AFP journalists in Libya verified the account and confirmed that it belongs to the TBZ.""Large numbers of illegal immigrants in Musaid. Our army is the protector of the homeland,"" the caption reads, along with a fire emoji. The video was shot from a different angle and from the other side of the road compared to the one in the false claims.  However key details match.In the video used in the Polish claims, we can see two members of the security forces on the left who appear in the June 7 video posted by the TBZ brigade. We have circled them in blue and red in the screenshot comparisons below.The two men in beige uniforms are also visible in another video of the same march that was posted to TikTok on June 1, as shown in the final screenshot below, alongside other members of the security forces circled in green and yellow.Screenshots from Twitter (left) and Facebook (right) taken July 25, 2023Screenshot from TikTok taken July 25, 2023The TBZ also published a Facebook post on June 1 Â entitled ""Libyan border"" showing security forces and a group of men.The visual similarities and overlap in dates enable us to debunk the theory that these men were heading to Italy under Libyan military escort.From the video details, it is not possible to identify the exact moment when the group of migrants was expelled from Libya. But we can posit that it was likely between May 31 and June 1, 2023, when videos of the expulsion of Egyptian nationals at Libya's eastern border began appearing on social media.Now we will look at where the men were really headed.Geolocation shows Libyan security forces by Egyptian borderWe used reverse searchÂ methods to find previous publications of the second video from the false Polish claims. We found that it was posted on the Twitter account of Egyptian media platformÂ RassdNews (archive link). on June 2 with the caption ""Libyan authorities return thousands of illegal immigrants to Egypt via the Musaid land crossing"". The date on the footage is May 31, 2023.The screenshot comparison below shows that the same security forces and buildings appear in both videos.Screenshots from Facebook (left) and Twitter (right) taken July 25, 2023We deciphered the Arabic inscriptions that appear on the vehicles in both videos.Â The phrases include: ""Derna Security Forces Directorate"", ""Police"", ""Interior Ministry"". The terms suggest that the vehicles belong to the police from this area in eastern Libya.Â The logo on the vehicles resembles the one on the Facebook page of theÂ police directorate in the city of DernaÂ as well as the nationalÂ logo of the Libyan police.Â The logo and Arabic wording on the police vehicles are highlighted in purple below.Screenshot from Facebook taken July 25, 2023We also geolocated the videos.Google Street View is not available in Libya, so we had to find another way to locate the road from the videos. On Google satellite images of Musaid, we located some of the buildings that appear in the videos, including the one with the green, semi-circular roof (highlighted in purple below).Screenshots from Facebook (left) and Google Maps (right). Side-by-side comparison made July 25, 2023Thanks to another video published by Al Jazeera LiveÂ (here) we identified several of the same buildings, including the building with the green roof, as well as a multi-storey grey building and smaller house nearby, both highlighted in green below. The building on the opposite side of the road, indicated with an orange arrow below, matches images of the Camel Hotel on Google Maps.Screenshots from Facebook (left) and the Aljazeeramubasher.net site (right). Side-by-side comparison made July 25, 2023From this we can conclude that the videos were shot in the town of Musaid, 4.7 km from the border checkpoint with Egypt (archive link).Where were the men going?Thanks to this geolocation process we can conclude that the second video shows the men are walking to the south as the Camel Hotel is behind them and the building with the green roof is on their right.On Google Maps, we see that the road heading south passes by a customs office (which also has a green roof, but this one is pitched), which has a big parking lot in front of it. The location is about 1 km -- or around 14 minutes on foot -- outside the city on the way to the border. These features match those in the videos on Polish social media.The screenshots below -- from the two videos -- clearly show that the men are some distance from the Camel Hotel in the background, circled in red.Screenshots from Twitter (left) and the TBZ Facebook account (right). Side-by-side comparison made July 21, 2023In the video from TBZ's June 7 post, the customs building with a green pitched roof appears at the 19-second mark. In the screenshot below we also see the same two big buildings that we were able to identify thanks to Google Maps, one of which is the Camel Hotel.Screenshot from the TBZ Facebook account taken July 21, 2023On the Google satellite images below, we circled the green roof of the customs buildings located to the right of the road leading to the border crossing from Musaid.

Climate change and overcrowding keep European tourism sector on its toes,"As climate change heats up Europe's south, tourism is slowly moving north. In line with the EU's Tourism Agenda 2030, countries are striving to make their tourism sectors greener, more digital and more sustainable, with some even shifting their focus to promoting less traditional destinations. At the same time, others are finding ways to ease the burdens of overtourism in popular destinations.Destructive fires, temperatures topping 40 degrees Celsius and tourists dodging possible catastrophes by staying home: Will climate change transform tourism – not least in the Mediterranean?July was the hottest month on record, according to data from the EU's Copernicus climate change service. Deputy director Samantha Burgess, referring to calculations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said it hasn't been this warm for at least 120,000 years.Regions which welcome a large share of holidaymakers are also those hardest hit by climate change. In Greece, thousands of tourists have been evacuated in July from the islands of Rhodes and Corfu which have been ravaged by fires touched off by suffocatingly hot weather. Italy has also laboured under heatwaves with the island of Sardinia melting in temperatures of 48 degrees Celsius.Will holidaymakers be drawn to Sweden or Ireland instead of the Mediterranean in future? A survey by the European Travel Commission (ETC), the umbrella organisation of various European tourism organisations and authorities, indicated the first shifts. According to the survey, however, Spain is still the favourite destination for people who want to travel from June to November. It is followed by France, Italy, Greece and Croatia.On the one hand, ""there is (currently) no change in booking behaviour due to the prolonged heat wave in southern Europe,"" says Norbert Fiebig, President of the German Travel Association DRV. On the other hand, of the 6,000 people surveyed across Europe, 10 percent fewer are planning a trip to the Mediterranean compared to last year. In contrast, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark have seen an increase in popularity. ETC attributes this to travellers seeking less crowded locations and milder temperatures.https://twitter.com/Karl_Lauterbach/status/1679484860812136448?s=20""We expect travel flows in Europe to be more influenced by unpredictable weather conditions in the future,"" says Eduardo Santander, ETC Executive Director. Travellers are more likely to avoid southern destinations during heat waves. ""This could lead to more Europeans being drawn to destinations in Central and Eastern Europe in search of milder temperatures during the summer months."" Southern destinations could then in turn see more travellers in spring and autumn.A study by the European Commission shows how travel behaviour could change. â€œWe find a clear north-south pattern in tourism demand changes, with northern regions benefitting from climate change and southern regions facing significant reductions in tourism demand,"" it says.We expect travel flows in Europe to be more influenced by unpredictable weather conditions in the future,Eduardo Santander, Executive Director at the European Travel CommissionSeveral people take shelter from the sun under umbrellas on a beach in Pontevedra. Spain is being hit by the fourth heatwave of the summer and it is expected to continue at least until Thursday with an increased risk of forest fires, the weather service AEMET said on Monday. Photo: Elena FernÃ¡ndez/EUROPA PRESS/dpaGreen potential: changing course to increase appealAware of this reality exacerbated by the climate crisis, Spain wants to enhance its natural heritage, such as forests or biosphere reserves, to try to break with its usual image. The government's own tourism promotion agency has recently pointed out the need to turn the country ""into a multi-product destination"", beyond sun and beach.For the government tourism agency, this process must involve a transformation of the Spanish tourism sector – a purpose that is also included in the EU's Agenda for Tourism 2030, which especially stresses the need to install the green and digital transition at the heart of the tourism activity of the country's tourism sector.Slovenia has already been stepping up its efforts to boost its tourism industry for years, building on its green destination slogan. With its forested areas, abundant water, opportunities for active holidays in nature and urban tourism, Slovenia is becoming an increasingly popular destination, but not for mass tourism.The key challenges include sustainable tourism with the lowest possible carbon footprint, sustainable mobility, locally produced healthy food, and adequate human resources. By introducing sustainable practices, the population will also be able to accept the pressures of tourism more easily, which has been a problem in recent years in the most popular tourist destinations such as Bled and Bohinj.Regional conditions influence success of tourismBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) has great tourism potential, especially in the field of mountain and river tourism. However, this potential is recognized more by international development organisations that allocate substantial funds for the development and promotion of these potentials, rather than by domestic institutions. BiH also follows the global trends of increased interest by tourists in colder regions.What characterises this region are extremely favourable prices for package tours, and preserved natural beauty, but problems arise from poor transport infrastructure and an unstable political situation. Little has been done to promote the tourism potential of Bosnia and Herzegovina worldwide, and what has been done has not been implemented systemically.Regarding climate change, probably the only somewhat positive influence is the ""lengthening of the summer season"", with more and more tourists choosing to spend their holidays in June and, implicitly, decreasing the pressure on the peak of the season, says Dumitru Luca, president of the Romanian National Association of Tourism Agencies (ANAT).The milder winters of recent years have increased tourist traffic in the months between November and March. The ski resorts, however, suffer from the warming of the winter season and even with artificial snow production facilities, often must accept defeat in the battle with temperatures constantly above zero, he added.Protecting iconic destinations from overtourismJust before lunchtime at the height of the summer season, the narrow alleys of France's iconic Mont-Saint-Michel are usually thronged with a crush of people. But come late afternoon, the same steeply ascending lanes are almost deserted.It's a dilemma shared by dozens of other sites popular with tourists in France and elsewhere in Europe, which during summer days are filled to bursting with visitors, but empty out in the evenings and during the off season, often to the detriment of the local economy.The small French island of Brehat is restricting the number of visitors this summer after seeing as much as 15 times its population arrive at its rocky shores in a single day. The island, home to just 377 permanent residents, is part of the EU conservation network Natura 2000 that aims to promote biodiversity by protecting habitats of the most vulnerable species.UNESCO has also recently recommended that Venice be added to its world heritage in danger list. UNESCO said the city faces ""irreversible"" damage from a range of threats, including the climate crisis and mass tourism, adding that the Italian authorities need to do more to protect it. The recommendation will be put to a meeting of UNESCO's World Heritage Committee in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in September. Venice has been a UNESCO heritage site since 1987.A view of the pyramid in the courtyard of the Louvre Museum. Photo: Christian BÃ¶hmer/dpaBalancing act for local economiesThe city of Paris said on Monday that its tough restrictions on the online accommodation service Airbnb were working, pointing to fewer violations of the code this year in the French capital but stiffer fines. Airbnb use has grown dramatically in recent years across the world, with the service allowing users to find accommodation in a private home rather than a hotel.In 2021, Paris won approval from France's Court of Cassation for its restrictions, with the instance ruling they were in line with EU law. The French capital will host the summer Olympics in 2024 when accommodation prices are expected to be peaking.""The regulatory arsenal"" of the city ""is working, there are fewer infringements"", the city hall said in a statement, adding that the high figures of litigation in 2021 and 2022 were due to cases being suspended pending a ruling from the EU.In Romania, however, fiscal measures regarding fees and taxes discussed by the Bucharest Executive are criticised. Workers in the tourism field argue that an increase in taxation in tourism will be reflected in prices, which will restrict consumption and position Romania in third place in Europe in terms of VAT, after Denmark and Great Britain.One thing sector professionals agree on is that tourism will change. While the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced the number of tourists, the sector is now approaching pre-pandemic levels – and with it, new challenges. The impact of climate change, the need to make the sector more sustainable and the search for solutions to overtourism will keep the sector on its toes.This article is published weekly.

"Europe in brief: EUR 100 billion of investments planned in European chip industry, announces Thierry Breton","Europe aims to become self-sufficient in the area of semiconductor production and the European Commission has positive evaluations for North Macedonia. In other news: Commission President von der Leyen visits flooded areas in Slovenia, European citizens want more action against disinformation online and July 2023 has officially been the hottest month ever recorded.Brussels (AFP) – The European Union is to invest ""more than 100 billion euros"" in its semiconductor production policy in order to become self-sufficient in this area, said European Commissioner for the Internal Market Thierry Breton on Thursday.In line with the strategy of the Chips Act, which aims to increase the European Union's production of electronic chips to 20 percent of world capacity by 2030, ""over 100 billion euros of investments are now planned for Europe,"" the French Commissioner told RTL.And ""yes, we will meet our target, and we may even achieve it ahead of schedule,"" Breton added.""There are now more than 68 projects in 19 countries that will enable us to regain our competitiveness and also our strategic autonomy,"" the Commissioner said.Until now, some 43 billion euros in subsidies have been earmarked for the Chips Act, which was voted for by the EU this year.This new figure comes two days after the announcement that Taiwanese chip giant TSMC is to set up its first European plant in Dresden, eastern Germany (10 August 2023).EC positively assesses new law on Academy for Judges and ProsecutorsSkopje (MIA) – The European Commission positively assesses the new Law on Academy for Judges and Prosecutors, which has been recently adopted in the Parliament, in the screening report on the Fundamentals cluster, the Ministry of Justice said Thursday in a press release.â€œThis is a great acknowledgment from the international community that monitors the progress of the Republic of North Macedonia. The legal changes were initiated by the Minister of Justice, Krenar Lloga, and supported by the MPs of the ruling majority, after they were previously blocked in the Parliament. The Academy for Judges and Prosecutors remains a bright spot in the reform process of the justice system,â€ the European Commission concluded in the screening report, reads the press release.With the changes, it is possible to obtain a unified certificate for completed initial training for judges and public prosecutors, reads the press release.The European Commission considers that this represents a great benefit in raising the quality of the selection of the best, who are registered for admission to the Academy's initial training.â€œThe law also provides for unifying court practice through increased number of training for judges within the Academy for Judges and Prosecutors, as well as a redefinition of the way of passing the entrance and final exams, based on objective criteria for assessing the knowledge of the candidates,â€ the press release reads.The Ministry of Justice said that they will be fully committed to reforms in the judiciary in the upcoming period aimed at fulfilling the criteria for EU membership. (10 August)Europeans want more action against disinformation on the internetBrussels (Belga) – More than half of Europeans doubt the veracity of the information they find on the internet. That is according to a survey published on Thursday by the Bertelsmann Stiftung. A large majority of Europeans believe that technology companies and political decision-makers should do more to combat online disinformation.Some 85 percent of European citizens think political decision-makers should do more to combat the spread of disinformation. 89 percent also think the companies behind social networking platforms should take more action.This goes hand in hand with a growing awareness of the problem among European citizens. According to the survey, some 54 percent of them often or very often doubt the accuracy of the information they find on the internet, while 39 percent say they have already been confronted with disinformation.Less than one in two (44 percent) say they have ever checked information found online. Even fewer report disinformation (22 percent). Age plays an important role here: the younger and better educated the respondents, the more they question the accuracy of information and take action to combat disinformation. The survey also shows that intense users of social networks are more exposed to disinformation. Twitter and Telegram users in particular see a lot of it.When it comes to the influence of social networks on democracy, Europeans are divided, with big differences between countries. Critical views predominate in France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, while Poles are much more positive about the influence of networks on democracy.The survey on which the Bertelsmann Stiftung study is based was conducted last March among 13,270 people aged between 16 and 70 in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and Spain. (10 August)Crisis visit to Slovenia by Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission. European Commission president visits flooded areasLjubljana/Crna na KoroÅ¡kem (STA) – On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen toured the areas affected by the massive floods that swept Slovenia last week The floods are the worst disaster in the country's history.She met with Prime Minister Robert Golob and President Natasha Pirc Musar and addressed the National Assembly, which was holding an extraordinary session. Von der Leyen assured Slovenia of the solidarity and support of the European Union and announced that the EU Solidarity Fund will make 400 million euros in grants available to the country, 100 million this and 300 million euros next year.Slovenia is an outstanding example of an EU Member State, a friend of ours, which has always responded immediately when other countries needed help. Now Slovenia needs help, and of course we stand by it. Slovenia can count on Europe.European Commission President Ursula von der LeyenThe Commission President, who was accompanied by the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez LenarÄiÄ, pointed out that time was also of the essence when it came to securing additional funding from the NextGeneration EU recovery fund which still has 2.7 billion euro available for Slovenia to borrow. Slovenia has until the end of August to apply for the additional loans, which is why Ljubljana and Brussels set up a joint working group on Wednesday to help Slovenia obtain the funds.Von der Leyen described the destruction, which she saw from the air, as ""heartbreaking."" In a later address to the members of the National Assembly, she also described the scale of the disaster as a ""national and European tragedy.""When we need help, solidarity is worth the most.Slovenian Prime Minister Robert GolobThe EU was the best thing that could have happened to Slovenia and Europe in the last hundred years, Golob stressed, illustrating that when Slovenia needed help, it was given immediately. ""The European Commission will do its utmost to ensure that Slovenia receives rapid and generous assistance, and this is an important message that the government will incorporate into its plans,"" he assured. He also announced the creation of a special fund for flood recovery, which would include both EU funds and money from the Slovenian budget. The first installment from the national budget would amount to 300 million euros, he said.The display panel of a pharmacy shows a temperature of 46 degrees in downtown Rome. Photo: Domenico Stinellis/APEU climate change service: July 2023 hottest month ever recordedGeneva/Reading (dpa) – It is official now: July was the hottest month ever recorded, according to data from the EU's Copernicus climate change service. The service only has data since 1940, but Copernicus deputy director Samantha Burgess said on Tuesday, referring to calculations by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ""It hasn't been this warm for at least 120,000 years."" Climate researchers can reconstruct historical climate from tree rings, air bubbles in glaciers and corals, among other things.The average global temperature in July was 16.95 degrees, 0.33 degrees higher than the previous record month July 2019, according to Copernicus. The ocean temperature was also higher than ever recorded before. ""These records have serious implications for people and the planet, which is subject to increasingly frequent and intense extreme events,"" Burgess warned. The world's hottest day to date was 6 July 2023, with a global average temperature of 17.08 degrees, according to the data.The temperature over land was 0.72 degrees higher globally in July than the average for 1991 to 2020, according to the Copernicus data, and 0.51 degrees higher for the ocean temperature about 10 metres below the surface. The Copernicus data is based on computer-generated analyses that incorporate measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.The US climate agency NOAA publishes its data for July in mid-August. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) in Geneva does not rule out that the full year 2023 will be hotter than the previous record year 2016, when the average temperature was 1.3 degrees above the pre-industrial level (1850-1900). Since that time, global warming has been progressing due to man-made climate change. It has accelerated sharply since the 1980s.For Germany in particular, July was definitely not a record month, according to an expert from the German Weather Service (DWD). The month was too warm in this country in a multi-year comparison, but not record-breaking either for a July or overall. (7 August)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Irish story misstating the impact of climate change is fabricated,"The European Union's climate observatory, the Copernicus Climate Change Service, has reported that July was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth. While much of Europe was hit by historic heat, Ireland experienced another kind of extreme weather event being exacerbated by climate change: heavy rains. Within this context, an image circulating on social media appears to show a story about ""asymptomatic global warming"" published online by the Irish Independent, but the purported screenshot is fabricated. The news website published no such article, and the professor named said he did not make the statement attributed to him.""Why is July so cold while everywhere else on the planet is burning? Prof. Luke O'Neill says Ireland is suffering from asymptomatic global warming,"" says what appears to be a headline from the Irish Independent in an image shared July 21, 2023 onÂ Facebook.The same supposed headline circulated on Instagram, TikTok and Twitter, which is being rebranded as ""X.""Screenshot of a Facebook post taken July 27, 2023But the article is fake -- it does not appear on live or archived versions of the Irish Independent's website.""The Irish Independent has never published an article under this headline,"" a spokesperson for the paper's owner Mediahuis Ireland said in a July 27 email.Similarly, Luke O'Neill, chair of biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin, told AFP: ""I never spoke about 'asymptomatic global warming' -- I've never even heard of the term.""He said he did appear July 20 on NewsTalk (archived here) to discuss how the body copes with high temperatures, but the conversation was not focused on Ireland's weather.Other independent fact-checking organizations, including Full Fact and USA Today, have debunked the fake Irish Independent headline.

Europe in brief: Rutronik CEO condemns EU semiconductor subsidies,"The CEO of Rutronik, a German semiconductor distributor, believes EU subsidies for the sector are missing their mark. The European Public Prosecutor is investigating possible abuses in two EU-funded railway renewal projects in Bulgaria. Spainâ€™s First Vice-President and Acting Economy Minister Nadia CalviÃ±o is to be proposed as a candidate to chair the European Investment Bank (EIB).Eisingen (dpa) – Thomas Rudel, CEO of the semiconductor distribution company Rutronik, thinks little of plans for expanding the chip industry in Europe. According to him, the money would eventually benefit foreign companies. Building up new companies was not worthwhile, Rudel said. ""If you want to do it properly, you have to invest 8 to 10 billion euros.""Machines were currently just as hard to come by in Germany as electrical engineers, he added. ""And then you don't have patents yet. And without patents, you can't sell anything,"" Rudel said.In July, the European Parliament had approved the European Chips Act, which is to mobilise up to 43 billion euros for the chip industry. The investments are to come from the EU budget and the private sector, among others.However, Europe has lost importance compared to the markets in Asia and America, Rudel said. In the past, market shares were roughly evenly distributed, he stated. ""That has shifted."" Europe now accounts for only 9 to 10 percent of market share. According to Rudel, customers are also no longer investing heavily in Europe. ""We are moving with our customers, whether we like it or not,"" Rudel said.We are moving with our customers, whether we like it or not. Thomas Rudel, CEO of RutronikRutronik is one of only a handful of semiconductor distributors in Germany. These companies act as distributors for the manufacturers, mainly for medium-sized companies. The company operates a large logistics centre near Pforzheim, Germany.On Tuesday, the Taiwanese chip manufacturer TSMC had announced plans to build a semiconductor plant in the German city of Dresden by 2027. Subsidies worth billions are planned. Experts question, however, whether the local economy will get the hoped-for boost. (13 August)European Public Prosecutor investigates Bulgaria over railway projects fundsLuxembourg/Sofia (BTA) – The European Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating possible abuses in two EU-funded railway renewal projects in Bulgaria, worth more than 241 million euros.The announcement by the prosecutor's office headed by Laura KÃ¶vesi said searches had been carried out at the homes of the suspects and at the premises of the companies under investigation. Two people have been arrested. More than 100 police officers and agents of Bulgariaâ€™s State Agency for National Security (SANS) took part in the raid. Addresses in the Bulgarian cities Sofia, Burgas, Varna, Stara Zagora, Smolyan and Pazardzhik were searched.Two railway infrastructure modernisation projects are being investigated. The first is for the section between the towns Kostenets and Septemvri on the Sofia-Plovdiv line, worth over 130 million euros. The second is for the modernisation of the railway section between Orizovo and Mihailovo, part of the Plovdiv-Burgas line, a project worth over 111 million euros. The beneficiary of both projects is the Bulgarian National Railway Infrastructure Company (NKZI), and both contracts have been awarded to two private companies with international participation.â€œI have ordered NKZI to fully cooperate with the prosecutor's office and I hope it will go all the way in its investigation,â€ Transport Minister Georgi Gvozdeykov said.So far, facts have been uncovered that could constitute criminal offences, including misuse of EU funds and money laundering, the European Public Prosecutor's Office said.

She said that with her candidacy, Spain was making ""a strong bid"" to become president of the financial institution for the first time in its history. The EIB has so far been led by seven men.For its part, the conservative Partido Popular (PP) questioned CalviÃ±o's candidacy and described it as ""the last great lie"" of the Prime Minister, socialist Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who has always defined the Vice-President as ""his economic voice."" The PP also called it a ""democratic anomaly"" that SÃ¡nchez did not call its leader, Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, to inform him of CalviÃ±o's candidacy for the EIB.

European railway networks on a bumpy ride to green(er) mobility,"The EU pushes for more sustainable travel solutions continent-wide. The plan is to strengthen long-distance and cross-border connections with the Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) policy and funding for railway infrastructure. While the demand for rail travel is high, national operators and startups are competing with â€œunreasonably low pricesâ€ for flights, night trains are experiencing a renaissance and  experts are calling for a Europe-wide kerosine tax.Politicians, transport experts and business people alike are criticising the state of the railway infrastructure,Â theÂ heavyÂ subsidising of airborne travel and the seeming lack of political will.Â Â In the fight against climate change, the EU Commission wants twice as many high-speed trains to run on European tracks by 2030 and three times as many high-speed trains by 2050. This is intended to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector. For German railway operator Deutsche Bahn and other European railways, far more investment is needed to expand high-speed rail transport in Europe as envisaged by the EU Commission.If the so-called Green Deal is to succeed, ""the EU and the member states will have to make considerable additional investments and invest in network expansion throughout Europe"", Deutsche Bahn announced in July. The infrastructure measures currently in planning or under construction are not sufficient to achieve a doubling of high-speed traffic by 2030.Expensive trains, cheap flights –Â â€œcrash landingâ€ for climate protectionClimate-friendly rail is often more expensive than air travel on the same route, environmental organisation Greenpeace concluded after comparing ticket prices for both means of transport on 112 routes across Europe at several booking times. According to the organisation, 71 percent of the tickets for rail travel were more expensive than those for air travel, which is more damaging to the climate. The testers registered the most glaring price difference on the Barcelona-London route, which cost up to 384 Euro by train. That was 30 times more than by plane with a ticket price of 12.99 Euro. ""More and more people want to travel by train and do without flights, but the lack of a kerosene tax and further climate-damaging subsidies for the airline industry distort prices. This is a crash landing for many good intentions and climate protection"", Greenpeace transport expert Marissa Reiserer said, calling for a Europe-wide kerosene tax of 50 cents per litre. That would bring in annual revenues of 46.2 billion Euro. These funds would have to be channelled into the rail infrastructure. German federal Green politician Anton Hofreiter also demanded flying to be made more expensive and called for a European kerosene tax too. More and more people want to travel by train and do without flights, but the lack of a kerosene tax and further climate-damaging subsidies for the airline industry distort prices.Greenpeace transport expert Marissa ReisererRail transport is ""subject to various taxes and fees,"" in particular for using the infrastructure, said Philipp Kosok, an analyst at the German think tank Agora. There is also no centralised site to consult timetables and compare prices. ""There's not really a European approach to train travel at the moment,"" said Chris Engelsman. The co-founder of the Belgian-Dutch startup European Sleeper that inaugurated a nightline between Berlin and Brussels in May. Another train startup co-founder, French Adrien Aumon, stated: ""I realised that it was almost impossible to travel in Europe (without flying). People were asked to get off the planes, but without necessarily offering them solutions.â€ His startup Midnight Trains is partnering with a night train maker to relaunch the once popular Paris–Milan–Venice line in 2025. Experts are calling for a Europe-wide kerosene tax. Greenpeace found that 71 percent of the tickets for rail travel were more expensive than those for air travel, which is more damaging to the climate. Photo: Boris Roessler/dpaModernisation is underway, but change takes timeIt seems like attention to and maintenance of the railway infrastructure has been somewhat neglected in various European countries due insufficient investments in the past. A focus on improving road networks or aftermath of conflict, in recent years, made the need for improvement apparent. Billions of Euro are being earmarked by national governments, rail operators and the EU alike. But it will take time until the rejuvenation and expansion will be completed.In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) for example, the precarious state of the railway infrastructure is credited to the war in the 1990s and insufficient financial investments. However, Edin Forto, the countryâ€™s minister of transport and communications, made the construction and revitalisation of railway infrastructure domestically and internationally a priority of his mandate.The advances were made by the reconstruction of the Sarajevo – Mostar route. New passenger trains which are capable of a maximum speed of 220 km/h were acquired, and the project cost about 67.5 million euros. The railway line is located on the pan-European 5C-Corridor which connects Budapest (Hungary) to PloÄe (Croatia). This means that more 50 percent of the line lies on BiHâ€™s territory and needs to be modernized and maintained.  In Croatia, where the 5C-Corridor ends, highway networks have been the focus of investments for decades, leaving the railwork infrastructure in a rather neglected state. The government aims to improve matters, but this will take time and funds. Construction and modernisation projects are underway, aiming to revitalise and modernise 30 percent (780 kilometres) of the total network according to EU standards by increasing the capacity of railway lines, speed of travel and safety. The projected speed of passenger trains is 160 kilometres an hour, while freight trains will be able to develop a speed of 120 km/h which is not considered high-speed. Until the period of 2030, 5.4 billion Euro are earmarked for this with around 85 percent of the necessary funding coming from EU co-financing.About 25 major infrastructure projects are currently being implemented in Croatia. Most of the investments are for projects along two transport corridors: The RH1, running from the Slovenian border to the Serbian border, and the RH2, stretching from the northern Adriatic port city of Rijeka to the border with Hungary. The RH2 shall connect the Iberian Peninsula to the TEN-T European network. The EUâ€™s network policy TEN-T aims to develop a coherent and efficient transport infrastructure across the European Union, comprising railways, waterways, roads, ports, airports and terminals. Two core European corridors of the trans-European transport network, the Mediterranean Corridor and the Baltic-Adriatic Corridor run through Slovenian territory. The country functions as a transit country and has just over 1,200 kilometres of railway lines. 875 km of these are still single-track. But the growing importance of green mobility and the need for more intensive investment in rail infrastructure have led to a new significant increase in the country's investment budget. In 2023, the Slovenian Infrastructure Directorate can avail of 423.7 million Euro for investment in rail infrastructure. The country has also taken advantage of opportunities through various European Union mechanisms.The German government is planning to provide national railway operator Deutsche Bahn with billions of Euro in additional funding from its Climate and Transformation Fund (KTF). By 2027, the federally owned railway is to receive â‚¬12.5 billion from the fund, according to a draft of the fund's new budget.The country's rail network is in part dilapidated and in need of fundamental renovations but it is likely to take several years before measures will be noticeable to passengers.We will do everything in our power to continue the enormous investment boom in the coming years – with the goal, confirmed in the coalition's decision in March, of providing a total of up to 45 billion Euro in additional funding by 2027.German Federal Transport Minister Volker WissingGermanyâ€™s government has been slow to prioritise the issue. ""We will do everything in our power to continue the enormous investment boom in the coming years – with the goal, confirmed in the coalition's decision in March, of providing a total of up to 45 billion Euro in additional funding by 2027,"" German Federal Transport Minister Volker Wissing recently affirmed.With around 38.000 kilometres, the German rail network is the largest and one of the most complex in Europe and thus poses particular challenges for operators – such as a high rate of trains running late. This has consequences for cross-border travel. Swiss railways SBB for example announced that they are using more replacement trains in Basel in order to offer punctual connections in Switzerland. Travellers arriving from Germany then have to switch trains for further travel in Switzerland.93 percent of Swiss trains are on time. Since spring, a new tool shall help to improve energy efficiency and punctuality. One hour before departure, SBB calculates the optimal travel strategy based on the weather and traffic situation. With the tool, train drivers know exactly how many seconds they are behind schedule during the journey so that they can take countermeasures.However, not everybody is happy about the plans to extend the railway networks. In June, French police clashed with thousands of protesters who seeked to stop construction of a new high-speed train line between France and neighbouring Italy. Supported by the European Union, the new line should eventually link France's Lyon and Turin in Italy, with a 57.5-kilometre tunnel through the Alps. The estimated cost is more than 26 billion Euro. Supporters say it will greatly ease freight road traffic but opponents say the ecological damage risks are devastating and that springs already started to dry up due to the works.A passenger on board the European Sleeper's first service in May. Photo: Eva Plevier/ANP/dpaClimate change concerns lead to renaissance of the sleeper trainNight trains have made a comeback in Europe thanks to their low-carbon footprint, but after years of neglect, the renaissance has had a bumpy ride. ""Operating night trains is very difficult, complex and expensive,"" German think tank analyst Kosok said, adding that the infrastructure was ""overloaded"" even at night when freight trains ply the rails.Despite the challenges, national rail operators are giving night trains another chance while startups are jumping on the bandwagon as climate concerns are making travellers ditch kerosene-burning planes for cleaner modes of transportation. Austrian rail operator OeBB, a pioneer in the sector, has Europe's biggest fleet of night trains, serving 1.5 million passengers in carriages that include bed compartments. The state-owned company considered abandoning its overnight services at one point, but it went the opposite direction and invested in them instead. ""Our night trains are nearly fully booked,"" OeBB spokesman Bernhard Rieder said as summer travel is in full swing in Europe. OeBB runs 20 routes connecting Vienna and other cities throughout Europe. There was no demand for night trains for over 25 years.OeBB spokesman Bernhard Rieder In 2018, OeBB ordered 33 new night trains from German conglomerate Siemens to expand its reach and replace part of its ageing fleet. Rieder admits that the quality of its service ""is not always as high these days as what we want to deliver to our customers"". Manufacturing ground to a halt, he said as ""there was no demand and no request for night trains for over 25 yearsâ€. This sentiment is shared by the two train startup founders: Aumont who says service â€œhas deterioratedâ€ over time, and Engelman adding that â€œthe train is not always up to modern standardsâ€, blaming the â€œlack of investment for decadesâ€. In Austria, the first trains – with a modern design, more privacy and more shower facilities – are expected to go into service for OeBB at the end of this year.This article is published weekly.

In other news: The European Commission will shift further Interreg funds to Moldova and Ukraine and the European Union Monitoring Mission in Armenia (EUMA) confirms no observers have been injured in â€œshooting incidentâ€ at the border with Azerbaijan.Madrid (EFE) – Spainâ€™s Acting Prime Minister and leader of the socialist PSOE Pedro SÃ¡nchez announced that he will ask for confidence to form a ""progressive majority"" in the country. He warned the conservative Peopleâ€™s Party (PP) that ""this is not the time to put pressure on the head of state,"" King Felipe VI, nor was it the time for ""magic tricks"" to try to get PP president Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o invested.In his first speech to the deputies and senators chosen in the general elections of 23 July, SÃ¡nchez also made a nod to the nationalist parties and announced that he will promote the use of co-official languages in EU institutions during the Spanish Presidency of the European Union.For his part, FeijÃ³o assured that he had ""no doubt"" that King Felipe VI ""will act as he has always done, in accordance with the law"" and ""only in the service of Spain and the Spanish people"" when it came to proposing a candidate to try to form a government. FeijÃ³o was referring to the debate on who the king would propose to form a government: the party with the most MPs or the one with the best chances of forming a government. (16 August)EU shifts funds for Moscow and Minsk to Ukraine and MoldovaBrussels (Belga) – The European Commission is again shifting 135 million euros in funds for interregional cooperation to Ukraine and Moldova. The money for so-called Interreg programmes was originally intended for projects with Russia and Belarus, but after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, cooperation with both countries was put on hold for those programmes.The money could serve to help Ukraine export its agricultural products, as well as develop cross-border transport links, health and research services, social inclusion programmes and institutions in Ukraine and Moldova.""This decision is a consequence of the brutal Russian war against Ukraine. It will allow strengthening cooperation between EU regions and local players with Ukrainian and Moldovan partners,"" explained European Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms Elisa Ferreira.Since March 2022, the European Commission has suspended cooperation with Russia and ally Belarus on Interreg programmes. This has already allowed 26 million euro to be channelled into cooperation programmes with Ukraine and Moldova. Regions in Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Poland were also able to participate in programmes other than those with Russia and Belarus.

It also reported no casualties.Azerbaijan said the claims amounted to disinformation and that Baku is warned in advance of the patrols.The EU, which began its border monitoring mission earlier this year, has taken on a broader mediation role between the two countries as they deal with disputes over the mountainous territory of Nagorno-Karabakh.The tensions between Baku and Yerevan have escalated sharply in recent days, as each side accuses the other of cross-border gunfire and violating agreements. For months, Yerevan has accused Baku of creating a humanitarian crisis by blocking traffic through the Lachin corridor -- the only road linking Armenia to Armenian-populated Karabakh.A man born in 1983 died ""as a result of chronic malnutrition, protein and energy deficiency"" in the breakaway region, Karabakh's rights ombudsman Ghegham Stepanyan said on Tuesday.""The catastrophic food situation caused by the blockade... creates direct and undeniable threats to 120,000 population of Artsakh,"" Stepanyan said, using the Armenian term for Karabakh. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for ""the unblocking of humanitarian routes, including the Lachin corridor"" in a call with his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov.The US had also echoed those calls.""We urge the government of Azerbaijan to restore free transit of commercial, humanitarian and private vehicles through this corridor,"" US State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said.Speaking with her Armenian counterpart Ararat Mirzoyan, French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna expressed ""France's deep concern as the population of Nagorno-Karabakh has been suffering the consequences of this situation for over eight months.""

"No, Germany is not forcing Ukrainian refugees to sell their cars","Germany has welcomed more than a million refugees from Ukraine since the start of the war, according to European Union figures. The newcomers have had to register and apply for temporary protection status, which replaces the need to apply for asylum, as agreed by the EU Council following Russia's invasion. An old claim, which has recently resurfaced on social media, alleges that Germany has also imposed another requirement: that Ukrainian refugees must report all of their assets and sell their car if its value exceeds 7,500 euros. This is false. German authorities told AFP that no such requirement for refugees exists. Only those applying for social assistance -- rather than all incoming refugees -- can be subject to property checks under certain circumstances. Moreover, such checks are not limited to any single nationality.Nearly 6,000 users have shared a Facebook post dated July 27, 2023, which claims that ""free movement of Ukrainian refugees in Germany ended on July 1, 2023"". The post says that from that date onwards refugees ""will be obliged to declare all of their financial means and personal property"" and if their car exceeds the value of 7,500 euros, ""the owner is obliged to sell the car and live off the proceeds"".Screenshot taken on Facebook on August 9, 2023This is not the first time that posts have appeared on social media giving the impression that every Ukrainian refugee arriving in Germany must declare their assets to authorities or face deportation.A similarly worded claim already circulated in Slovak last year. It included the phrase about ""ending the free movement of Ukrainian refugees"" and alleged that they would have to sell their cars if the value exceeded 7,500 euros. AFP refuted the claim here. Similar claims also circulated in Czech last year.Â Germany continues to assist Ukrainian refugeesGermany has taken in over one million war refugees from Ukraine as of March 2023, the highest number in the world in absolute terms, according to EU figures.Â AFP contacted German authorities, who confirmed that only those who apply for financial aid and can prove that they are in material need are required to declare assets or funds -- not all refugees fleeing the war.Upon arrival in Germany, Ukrainian refugees must register and apply for temporary protection in accordance with Article 24 of the Residence Act. This status replaces the need to apply for asylum and is a common practice of EU countries agreed by the EU Council on March 4, 2022. Temporary protection status is currently valid until March 4, 2024, with the possibility of extending it for a further year depending on the situation.An application for a residence permit is required if the refugee wants to find accommodation, employment, free (non-acute) healthcare, social benefits, etc.From January 1, 2023, refugees from Ukraine who have been granted asylum can claim the same social support as German citizens through the so-called Burgergeld, or basic citizen's income. For a single person this amounts to 502 euros a month. And a single mother can claim between 318 and 420 euros for each child, depending on their age. Claimants can also apply for additional help for accommodation and heating.Â Germany4Ukraine, a website from the German Migration Office intended specifically for refugees from Ukraine,Â states that due to the ongoing war, many Ukrainians in Germany are eligible for assistance even if they have property in Ukraine. However, if they have access to cash (for example, they are able to withdraw money from a bank), they must use the funds to cover their living costs.Screenshot taken on Germany4Ukraine website on 9 August 2023; the reference to the use of own resources is highlighted in red by AFPWhat does the German labour ministry say?AFP contacted the German labour ministry (BMAS), whose representatives told us in an email on August 9, 2023 that the information in the viral posts was false.Applicants for the Burgergeld welfare benefit must file a declaration of assets, which can be verified in individual cases, a BMAS representative said. However, the assets of all Ukrainian refugees who arrive in Germany are certainly not checked, he said. ""If a person from Ukraine lives in Germany on his or her own cost, there is no need to check assets,"" the BMAS representative said.As for the claim that refugees have to sell off their cars if they are worth more than 7,500 euros, the BMAS representative said that was not true either.Cars are claimed as ""reasonable"" assets up to a value of 15,000 euros and only if this value is exceeded can the authorities proceed to examine whether the claim for social benefits is justified. ""There are no plans to tighten these regulations,"" BMAS said.The situation in SwitzerlandOne country that has required refugees to sell their cars is Switzerland. However, this has proven difficult to implement.According to an article by the Swiss national broadcaster SRF in May 2023, no refugee has yet been forced to sell their car. Welfare applicants often claim that the car belongs to someone in Ukraine and in most cases the vehicles are not valuable enough to make it worth selling them in Switzerland, SRF reports.Since the beginning of the Ukraine war, we have verified a number of false claims related to this conflict.

Europe in brief: Denmark and the Netherlands commit to deliver F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine,"The commitment of Denmark and the Netherlands to provide Ukraine with F-16 fighter jets as soon as the conditions are met is the hottest topic in Europe in recent days. In other news: Bulgaria's Mariya Gabriel advocates the country's Schengen accession â€“ and Germanyâ€™s Chancellor Scholz defends border controls with Austria due to the migrant crisis.Berlin/The Hague/Moscow/Kiev (EFE) – Denmark will deliver 19 F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine, six of them later this year, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced after meeting Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Copenhagen.Earlier in the day, acting Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed in the presence of Zelensky that his country would deliver F-16 fighter jets to Ukraine ""as soon as possible,"" once the military training of Ukrainian pilots had been completed. He did not specify how many aircraft would be delivered. Before travelling to Denmark and the Netherlands on Sunday, Zelensky was in Sweden on Saturday to discuss the delivery of Swedish-made Gripen fighter jets and the production of Cv-90s armoured vehicles with Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson.â€œThese F-16s will give new motivation and energy to our soldiers and civilians.â€Volodymyr Zelensky, President of UkraineMeanwhile, Ukraine launched a drone attack on several points in the Russian rear including Moscow on Sunday, in retaliation for Russia's bombing of a theatre in the northern city of Chernobyl on Saturday, which killed seven civilians and injured nearly 150.

According to Gabriel, Bulgaria has come out of the international isolation it had fallen into during the last two years. She is convinced that the country is asserting its Euro-Atlantic path. It was a challenge for Bulgaria to speak with one voice, to address issues important to the people, she added. (20 August)Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Mariya Gabriel.

Era of new geopolitics,"The most recent BRICS summit shows that weeks before world leaders will gather at the 78th United Nations General Assembly, new geopolitical blocs are emerging. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and climate crisis are the main drivers of change in the new geopolitical order. Which role does the Global South play in future politics?Chinese leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin challenged the West at this weekâ€™s BRICS summit of emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Johannesburg. Some have already defined it as â€œthe summit of the Southern Hemisphereâ€. Putin, meanwhile, did not attend the summit in person, as he would have faced an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes.BRICS, held from August 22 to 24, was certainly the most significant gathering for Russia and the Global South since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It served as a meeting platform between Russia and four countries that not only refuse to side with the West against Moscow but aim to build, as the theme of the event says, an â€œinclusive multilateralismâ€. BRICS announced an expansion for 2024 to six new members (Argentina, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates).Â In short, a challenge to Western domination, even if a real break is not possible, in a world of interconnected interests.Inevitably, much of the attention was focused on Putin, who ordered one of Europe's biggest war since 1945 with his invasion of Ukraine almost 18 months ago. The Russian leader addressed the summit via video link and condemned Western countries for what he called the ""illegitimate sanctions that trample all the rules of international trade"" and for their policies which, in his opinion, fuel inflation. A crucial step towards a multilateral world is de-dollarisation, according to the Russian leader. A process which in his opinion ""is already irreversibly taking holdâ€œ, demonstrated by the fact that the use of the American currency was only equal to 28.7 percent of the total trade amount between the five BRICS countries in 2022. ""For the EU, this BRICS development means a massive challenge. We do not have many years to prove that Europe wants to be a credible, reliable and fair partner for poor and developing countries. If we don't succeed, then BRICS may become the vanishing point for many of these countries.""European Green MEP Reinhard BÃ¼tikoferRussia takes repeated swings at the West in its search for friendsRussia intends to continue to present itself as an alternative to Western countries whose neo-colonial policies it denounces. Putin insisted in a video speech at the BRICS summit that Russia was not to blame for the food crises in the world. He announced – as a sign of goodwill and signal to the Southern Hemisphere –, that Moscow will supply thousands of tons of cereals free of charge to six African countries.Last month, Russia terminated a UN-brokered deal to move vital grain exports out of blockaded Ukrainian ports. Turkey, along with the UN, had brokered the now-frozen grain deal between Ukraine and Russia and sees itself as a mediator in the war. President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan earlier said he expects to convince his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin to renew the grain deal. Moscow has so far not confirmed any such plans.Putinâ€™s rhetoric has become increasingly bellicose and threatening since February 2022. The United States and European countries responded by imposing a web of financial and trade sanctions. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said last year that Putin's world view was warped by ""great power mania and imperialismâ€œ.In mid-August, Putin also used the opening of the 11th Moscow Conference on International Security to take known swipes at Western powers, blaming them for fuelling unrest around the globe. Conflicts in large parts of the world were solely caused by the ""geopolitical adventures and the selfish, neo-colonial behaviour of the Westâ€œ, Putin said in a video message. The Kremlin boss has long accused the West of conspiring against anything and everything Russian.Russia and China, a no limit partnership?Russia seemed to be trying to use the security conference in Moscow to shore up alliances. Among the participants of the security conference was the new Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu.China is Russiaâ€™s largest trading partner and has refrained from imposing sanctions on Russia. Chinaâ€™s leadership has not publicly condemned Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, instead focusing on acting as a mediator between the two warring parties. Beijing and Moscow declared a â€œno limitsâ€ partnership shortly before Russia invaded its neighbour in February 2022. Putin found the side of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who in a speech read by his Commerce Minister, Wang Wentao, reaffirmed his willingness to ""promote the democratisation of international relations and multipolarity"".But the Chinese giant is grappling these days with a crisis that could be triggered by the real estate recession. With an overall GDP of around 26 percent of the world's GDP, the five BRICS countries are still far from the total of the G7 and the other EU countries. On the conflict in Ukraine, however, Beijing is not changing its mind. Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu also visited Russiaâ€™s ally Belarus on August 17.""Friends"" against US hegemon? In a speech delivered by the Chinese commerce minister at the BRICS summit, Xi criticized the United States without explicitly naming the country. ""There is a country that wants to maintain its hegemony and has done everything to cripple emerging and developing countries,"" he said. ""Those who are developing fast are being contained by them. Those who catch up are hindered.""Belarus and China are on the same page when it comes to building a multipolar world, Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko recently said. Like Putin, Lukashenko frequently speaks out against what he also describes as US hegemony. Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu and Lukashenko hailed plans to increase military cooperation between both their nations in Minsk on August 17. Joint military drills are expected to be conducted in 2024, the Belarusian president said. The autocratic leader stressed that Belarus relies primarily on its ""friends"" Russia and China for military assistance.What to expect from the UN General Assembly? In February 2023, a year after Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, the UN General Assembly called for an immediate end to the war in Ukraine, with 141 Member States in favour and seven against (Belarus, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Eritrea, Mali, Nicaragua, Russia and Syria). Among the 32 abstentions were China, India and Pakistan.In the weeks prior to the United Nations General Assembly, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres attended the BRICS summit to urge cooperation in the face of crises. He met with various leaders on the margins of the event. ""I have come to Johannesburg with a simple message: In a fractured world with overwhelming crises, there is simply no alternative to cooperation. We must urgently restore trust and reinvigorate multilateralism for the 21st century,"" Guterres said Thursday in his speech at the BRICS summit. https://twitter.com/antonioguterres/status/1694720091148157263Guterres called for a reform of global governance structures, which ""reflect the world of yesterday"" just after World War II, and warned that ""without such reform, fragmentation is inevitable."" ""This is particularly true in the case of the UN Security Council and the Bretton Woods institutions,"" said the head of the United Nations, referring to the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), dominated by West.Slovenia will take up its seat as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2024 and 2025 for the second time in its history. Slovenia's diplomacy has campaigned on a message of preserving international peace and cooperation. Included in that were matters of security, like climate, energy and food security, as well as integration and promotion of international solidarity. Thus, it will have to face many challenges, including changing geopolitical relations.Slovenia has repeatedly demonstrated that, as an EU and NATO member, it stands by the side of the attacked Ukraine. However, after Slovenia's election to the UN Security Council in June, Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon said that it would be necessary to find a way to talk and cooperate with Russia because without dialogue it is not possible to solve the world's challenges.Besides Ukraine, the UN General Assembly will focus on the climate crisisA few weeks ahead of the U.N. General Assembly, the European Commission lost â€œMr. Green Dealâ€, the most visible face of the fight against the climate crisis: the Dutch Social Democrat Frans Timmermans is stepping down at a crucial time for European climate laws. He is now the lead candidate for a left-wing coalition in the Dutch elections in November. The Slovak MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, currently serving as vice-president of the European Commission, will succeed him as EU Commissioner, tasked to deploy the European Green Deal.In mid-August, Brazilian president Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva spoke by phone with his US counterpart Joe Biden and stressed the importance of making serious progress in the debate on the climate crisis ahead of the next General Assembly of the United Nations. In the telephone conversation, Lula detailed the discussions carried out at the Amazon Summit, held in the Brazilian city of BelÃ©m at the beginning of August, with the participation of representatives of the eight countries that share the largest tropical forest on the planet. The Brazilian President Lula also proposed a reform of the UN Security Council.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
"Europe in brief: Mr. Green Deal leaves the EU, the DSA comes into force and the Spanish elections aftermath","Today, the European Union puts its Digital Services Act (DSA) into force, which is seen as a measure against the excesses of Internet giants. The Commission bids farewell to Mr. Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, who will stand in the Dutch elections later this year. In Spain, multiple scenarios are possible after Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, leader of the Spanish Popular Party (PP), got the go-ahead by King Felipe on Tuesday.Europe unleashes its super-weapon for regulating the InternetBrussels (AFP) – On Friday, the European Union is going on the offensive against the excesses of the Internet giants: the DSA (Digital Services Act) will force major platforms such as Google, Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and TikTok to take more action against illegal content. Otherwise, they will face heavy fines.The principle of the new European regulation sounds like a slogan: What is illegal offline must also be illegal online – which, all the experts stress, is not so simple. A delicate balance has to be struck between freedom of expression, which is paramount, and the fight against abuses that threaten fundamental rights or democracy (disruption of elections, disinformation, protection of minors, etc.).How can this be achieved? The DSA targets platforms, not users. From Friday on, a series of obligations will be imposed on the 19 largest social networks, marketplaces and search engines (including Apple, Google, Microsoft, YouTube, Amazon, Facebook, LinkedIn, Wikipedia, TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, X, Alibaba and Booking).As before, the platforms are neither legally responsible for the content they host nor obliged to check it beforehand. But the EU hopes to push them to install an effective system of control, after ten years of increasing online violence.Among other things, they will have to offer Internet users a tool for easily reporting ""illegal"" content (as defined by the European Union). (22 August)Timmermans: Guardian of the Green Deal leaves the EUBrussels (ANSA) – Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermans resigned as a member of the European Commission following his decision to stand in the upcoming parliamentary elections in the Netherlands.The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, expressed her gratitude to Timmermans for his many years of successful work on behalf of European citizens and accepted his resignation with immediate effect. Von der Leyen decided to entrust the supervision of the European Green Deal as well as, temporarily, Environment Policy to Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, pending a candidate put forward by the Netherlands.Timmermans will be the candidate of a joint list formed by the Social Democratic Party (Pvda) and the Greens (GroenLinks) for the Dutch early elections that will decide the successor to the government of liberal Mark Rutte this autumn. ""It's official! Thousands of members have voted for Frans Timmermans as leader of GroenLinks-PvdA for the upcoming parliamentary elections,â€ the coalition announced on X.â€œHe has a clear vision for a green and social future for the Netherlands and is ready to face the most important challenges with trust and mutual attention,â€ they added.Timmermans, Pvda and GroenLinks explained, received 91.8 percent of the votes in a referendum among members. Just under 38,000 members of the two parties took part in the consultation. However, the voting was a mere formality, as Timmermans was the only candidate. This is the first time that the Social Democrats and Greens are participating together in national elections, although they already form a single group in the Senate (22 August).Government before December or elections in January: Two scenarios emerging in SpainMadrid (EFE) – The Spanish Parliament will decide on the investiture as Prime Minister of the leader of the Conservatives, Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, in a session to be held on 26 and 27 September. This opens up two possible scenarios: the formation of a government before 27 November or a repeat election on 14 January.This timetable confirms that a large part of Spain's rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union (EU), which will last until 31 December, will be carried out under the baton of the current Spanish government in office, presided over by Pedro SÃ¡nchez, although there is the possibility of a transition in autumn, in the event that NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o is invested.On Tuesday, the leader of the Popular Party (PP) was designated as a candidate for investiture by the King of Spain, Felipe VI, as his party was the force that won the most votes in the last elections in July. However, NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o does not face an easy task. To be invested in the first round of voting, he has to reach the absolute majority, 176 of the 350 deputies.Therefore, a second round is expected to take place 48 hours later, on the 29th, in which he will only require a simple majority to be appointed president. In other words, he will have to get more yes than no votes. If he does not manage to do so, the door would be open for the current Spanish Prime Minister to run for the investiture in the next round.

"No, WHO pandemic treaty will not force more vaccines","In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic that cost millions of lives, the World Health Organisation pledged to come up with a plan to ensure a better response to future outbreaks of disease. It is due to be submitted to the World Health Assembly in 2024. As the plan is being drafted, it has been misrepresented on social media. For example, a Croatian MEP claimed in July 2023 that the plan would force countries to surrender their authority on vaccination to the WHO. As a result, he alleged, their citizens would be required to have many more vaccines. But such allegations are false and misleading. Countries are still in charge of their pandemic response and the plan only aims to improve international cooperation, experts told AFP. The WHO called negotiations among its 194 member states in December 2021 to draft a new agreement ""to strengthen pandemic prevention, preparedness and response"". Known as the Pandemic Treaty, it is being drawn up via a series of meetings.The WHO said it needed a treaty in ""recognition of the catastrophic failure of the international community in showing solidarity and equity in response to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic,"" according to early drafts. On Greek social media, widely shared misleading claims (here, here and here) show Croatian MEP Mislav Kolakusic claiming that the treaty will make countries surrender their authority to declare pandemics and procure vaccines. He said the WHO would use it to declare more pandemics in order to impose more vaccinations -- around 60-90 per person. He said that this would benefit large pharmaceutical companies, claiming that they control the WHO.These claims are baseless and misleading. The WHO does not have the power to demand that states implement policy and there is no evidence that it is controlled by pharmaceutical companies. His claim that the WHO will use the treaty to declare more pandemics in order to enforce more vaccinations is groundless.AFP had already looked into other claims that misrepresent this treaty: here and here, in French.Example of a Facebook post with misleading claims.Screenshot taken on July 17, 2023The MEP made the comments at an event at the European Parliament in Brussels on July 4, 2023 that was held by the Trust & Freedom European Citizens Initiative. The event was critical of planned amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), which define the obligations of nearly 200 countries in handling outbreaks of disease.Kolakusic had previously spread misinformation on the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination. AFP fact-checked some of his claims here, in Serbian.What is the Pandemic Treaty?The new accord is intended to ensure that all sectors ""are better prepared and protected, in order to prevent and respond to future pandemics,"" according to its FAQ page.""At the heart of the proposed accord is the need to ensure equity in both access to the tools needed to prevent pandemics (including technologies like vaccines, personal protective equipment, information and expertise) and access to health care for all people,"" it says.The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body (INB), which is leading the negotiations on the treaty, held its sixth meeting in July 2023. The latest publicly available version of the accord was published in June 2023 and can be found here.The INB includes a wide range of stakeholders, from member countries to the United Nations and other intergornmental organisations. It also seeks input from a range of groups, from civil society to medical institutions. The accord is expected to be submitted for adoption to the World Health Assembly in 2024. As per Article 19 of the WHO Constitution (here), ""a two-thirds vote of the Health Assembly shall be required for the adoption of such conventions or agreements, which shall come into force for each Member when accepted by it in accordance with its constitutional processes.""The treaty's FAQ page says that it ""would be expected that a new accord would be open to the participation of all countries, who would be able to participate if they so wished.""No requirement to 'surrender authority'The latest version of the treaty, which is also called the WHO CA+, does not say that states must give up their sovereignty on public health to the WHO, as claimed by Kolakusic. Article 3 upholds national sovereignty as a general principle. ""States have, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and the general principles of international law, the sovereign right to legislate and to implement legislation in pursuance of their health policies,"" it says.""In doing so, they shall uphold the purposes and objectives of the WHO CA+ and carry out their obligations under the WHO CA+ in a manner consistent with the principles of the sovereign equality and the territorial integrity of States and that of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other States.""Article 3 of the WHO CA , as formulated after the Continuing Fifth Session and Drafting Group of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. Screenshot taken on August 2nd, 2023""National sovereignty rests entirely with countries responsible for making health policies for their citizens,"" the WHO said in a tweet on February 25, 2023.A WHO spokesperson told AFP on July 21 that there is ""no basis whatsoever"" to the claim that the WHO CA+ will transfer responsibility for public health from sovereign states to the WHO.""The whole process is led by Member States, and only Member States can ratify the Pandemic Accord, and hold each other accountable for its implementation,"" the representative said.  ""Countries are still in charge of their pandemic response,"" Sharifah Sekalala, professor of global health law at the University of Warwick, told AFP on June 7. ""The treaty just tries to increase the level of international cooperation within this response.""The WHO accord ""does not in any way deny state sovereignty in dealing with pandemics"", Benjamin Mason Meier, a professor of global health policy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said on June 8. ""In fact, it will be drafted by states themselves,"" he added.As an international intergovernmental organisation, the WHO must respect the sovereignty of states and only has the authority given by its members of their own free will, according to Aurianne Guilbeau, political science lecturer at the University of Paris 8. She spoke to AFP in May 2023 for an article on the same topic.""States are free not to become parties to, sign or ratify the treaty, in its entirety or only some of its provisions. If states ratify the treaty, that means they agree to its provisions and undertake to abide by it -- that's the force of law. It may also happen that some states withdraw from the treaty,"" she said.This point is addressed on the FAQ page. ""As with all international instruments, any new accord, if and when agreed by Member States, would be determined by governments themselves, who would take any action while considering their own national laws and regulations,"" it says.The same document says that it is ""up to Member States to decide if and what compliance mechanisms would be included in the new accord on pandemic preparedness and response"".It points out that ""it is a general principle of international law that once an international law instrument is in force, it would be binding on the parties to it, and would have to be performed by those parties in 'good faith.'""International Health RegulationsThe new accord aims to be coherent with the IHR (here), which define members' rights and obligations in handling diseases and emergencies that have the potential to cross borders. These are legally binding on 196 countries, including the 194 WHO member states.The latest version was finalised in 2005, though there is an ongoing process to update them. Potential ""targeted"" amendments to the IHR related to the planned Pandemic Treaty are being considered, according to the WHO.Declaration of pandemicsClaims that the WHO CA+ and the updated IHR would give the WHO the overall authority to declare pandemics and procure vaccines on behalf of member countries are misleading.The latest version includes the option of adding a second paragraph to article 15, which is entitled ""International collaboration and cooperation"". The proposed paragraph says that ""the WHO Director-General shall determine whether to declare a pandemic"". However, the issue has not yet been settled.Technically the WHO does not declare a pandemic but a ""public health emergency of international concern"" (PHEIC), the WHO spokesperson told AFP on July 21. This requires legally binding action by the member states, including notifying the WHO of health issues that may be of international concern and responding to requests for information.World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus attends a combined news conference following a two-day international conference on COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine research on January 12, 2020 in Geneva.(Photo Fabrice COFFRINI / AFP)There is ""no basis whatsoever"" to the MEP's claim that the treaty would allow the WHO to declare a greater number of public health emergencies, according to the spokesperson.There are criteria for determining whether an event constitutes an emergency. They are laid out in Article 12 of the IHR of 2005 and include information provided by member states, relevant scientific evidence and an assessment of the risk to human health and the risk of the international spread of disease.""WHO's independent expert committee uses three criteria to decide when to declare a PHEIC and when to lift it. A public health event must be 'serious, sudden, unusual or unexpected; likely to spread internationally; and likely to require immediate international action,"" the spokesperson said.The same Article 12 has given the WHO the right to declare such an emergency since 2005. ""The Director-General shall determine [...] whether an event constitutes a public health emergency of international concern,"" it says.If a PHEIC is declared, WHO develops and recommends health measures for implementation by member states during the emergency.The WHO declared COVID-19 a PHIEC in January 2020, with WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus characterising it as a pandemic in March 2020. The PHEIC label was dropped in May 2023.The draft Pandemic Treaty and IHR (2005) stress the importance of information-sharing between states on pathogens with the potential to cause pandemics and epidemics. They underline the need for a ""timely, safe, transparent and rapid exchange of specimens and generic sequence data"", as stated in a proposed amendment of Article 44 of the IHR.Vaccine procurement Unequal access to pandemic-related products such as vaccines between poorer and richer nations has been blamed for boosting the global Covid death toll. The WHO criticised pharmaceutical companies for not releasing vaccine patents and called regularly for equitable access to vaccines. The WHO CA+ proposes tools to help with vaccine procurement and does not suggest that the WHO take over the role from member states. For example, Article 10 of the proposed agreement says that each state shall develop ""policy frameworks and principles for the negotiation of procurement agreements"".The procurement of vaccines and other pandemic-related products is addressed more directly in Article 13 of the latest draft of the WHO CA+, which focuses on supply chain and logistics. It emphasises the need ""to ensure the availability, affordability of, and equitable access to, pandemic-related products.""The draft document considers three different options for a more equitable distribution of pandemic products. All three suggest WHO involvement, for example in pooled purchasing mechanisms or facilitation of purchase agreements between buying countries and suppliers.A man reacts as health official delivers the fourth dose of COVID-19 coronavirus vaccine in Jakarta on January 25, 2023. (Photo by AZWAR IPANK / AFP)The proposed amendments (here) to the IHR recommend that the WHO coordinate ""equitable access"" to health products, including vaccines, as well as their ""availability and affordability"" in case of an international health emergency.In general, national governments and health services are responsible for the purchase of vaccines. However, there have been coalitions of buyers that acquire vaccines through pooled procurement. UNICEF has, for example, led pooling mechanisms for the purchase of vaccines against specific diseases, such as polio.During the COVID-19 pandemic, both the EU and the African Union purchased vaccines for their respective member states through pooling mechanisms. In 2020, the COVAX initiative was created by the WHO and other organisations, aiming for more equitable access to vaccines, especially in poorer countries.No basis for increased vaccination claim""The procurement of vaccines, and therefore the number of doses purchased and administered to EU citizens, are a national competence under the responsibility of individual Member States; ECDC does not monitor country purchases of vaccines,"" a spokesperson for the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the competent EU authority, told AFP on July 25.The MEP's statement that the new treaty will see more vaccines required by EU citizens is baseless, the spokesperson said, also dismissing claims that all EU citizens are currently required to have 11 each.""There is no 'EU average',"" the spokesperson said. From the ECDC's website on vaccination schedules, we can see that most countries recommend more than 11. Twelve countries have made at least one vaccine mandatory for specific groups, but vaccination remains, for the greater part, optional.In Greece, vaccines are not mandatory, but there is a recommendation of 15 vaccines for children and teenagers, as well as a few more for adults.In France, mandatory vaccination applies to children born in 2018 onwards, and there are indeed 11 mandatory vaccine doses.""Individuals may need more or fewer doses of a given vaccine depending on previous medical history, chronic conditions, the occurrence of natural disease, contraindications due to side effects, etc,"" the ECDC spokesperson said.Pharmaceutical companiesThe claim that the WHO is controlled by ""the owners of pharmaceutical mega-companies"" is also unsupported. Even though the WHO can receive funding from pharmaceutical companies, this represents only a tiny part of the organisation's budget. ""In 2020-21, WHO received approximately 0.75% of its budget from private sector entities (which includes pharmaceutical companies). In absolute terms, this meant US$ 54m compared to our annual budget of US$ 7 bn,"" a WHO spokesperson said via e-mail on August 1, 2023.No pharmaceutical companies are found among the WHO's top 20 contributors, as seen in the image below. Most of them are sovereign states, while others are international governmental and non-governmental organisations.The WHO's budget can be found in detail on its website here.Petros KONSTANTINIDIS All articlesAFP GrÃ¨ceAll articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in Brief: Lampedusa under migration pressure,"Over 4,000 migrants are currently on the Italian island of Lampedusa. In other news: Five EU member states jointly push for the extension of the import ban for Ukrainian grain until the end of this year. The President of the European Council Charles Michel visits flooded areas in Slovenia.Almost 4,000 migrants landed in LampedusaLampedusa/Rome (ANSA) – The landings of migrants on Lampedusa continue unabated: on Friday alone, there were 63 boats, with a total of 1,826 people. A record in terms of the number of rescues and the total number of migrants. There are overÂ 4,000 migrants at the reception centre on the Italian island of Lampedusa, among them including 243 unaccompanied minors.While working on the transfer of refugees throughout Italy, the Prefect of Agrigento, Filippo Romano, intervened after the NGO ship Ocean Viking and 438 non-EU citizens on board were assigned Genoa as a port. ""The message that is important for the NGOs to understand,"" he said, ""is that not letting them dock in Lampedusa does not mean harming them or creating further problems. It just means that Lampedusa, now as in the recent past, is absolutely unable to receive any more refugees. It means clearly stating that bringing in more people implies inadequate treatment.â€The government is working on a new Decreto Flussi (flows decree) for the arrival of 450,000 legal foreigners and a security decree law that will also contain a crackdown on deportations of irregular immigrants and age verification of migrants presumed to be minors. ""I believe that a new security decree is necessary as early as September, because Italy cannot be the point of arrival for migrants from halfway around the world,"" stressed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport Matteo Salvini, adding, ""since Italy sends billions of euros to Brussels every year, the defence of Italy's borders must be a European priority. Unfortunately, up to today, we have always been alone.â€ (26 August).Five EU countries want to extend ban on imports of Ukrainian grainWarsaw (TASR) – Five EU member states, including Slovakia, have agreed to jointly push for the extension of the ban on imports of Ukrainian grain until the end of this year. This was reported on Friday by Polish Agriculture Minister Robert Telus after a video interview with his departmental colleagues from Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria and Slovakia.Together, â€œwe support the extension of the ban on grain imports into our countries until the end of this year,â€ Telus confirmed.Several Central and Eastern European member states – Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria – have closed their market for Ukrainian wheat, maize and sunflower until mid-September with the Unionâ€™s approval, in order to protect their own agricultural sector. With the exception of Bulgaria, all these states share a border with Ukraine.Poland and Hungary have already announced in advance that they will continue to apply a ban, even if the EU does not extend the measure beyond 15 September.In Poland, imports of cheap Ukrainian grain led to a drop in prices in spring and sparked protests by farmers. According to Polish media, this situation was caused by the fact that much of the Ukrainian grain, instead of transiting to other countries, remained in Poland. (25 August)European Council President Charles Michel visits flooded areas in SloveniaKamnik/Bled (STA) – On Sunday, before attending the 18th Bled Strategic Forum (BSF), European Council President Charles Michel toured the areas affected by the recent floods in the vicinity of Kamnik, together with Prime Minister Robert Golob. He gave assurances that the EU will continue to stand by Slovenia in the future.""Slovenia is in a difficult situation. I am impressed by the courage of the people and the leadership,"" said Michel, adding that he had visited the country to reaffirm the importance of solidarity.Golob also reminded of the EU's promises not to forget Slovenia, adding that today's visit by Michel confirmed this. ""The EU stands with us and will help us not only to respond quickly after disasters, but also to rebuild,"" he said. He announced that Slovenia would also apply for additional loans from the European Recovery Fund.On Sunday evening, Golob and Michel also hosted an informal dinner with the prime ministers of the Western Balkan countries. ""Dinner with friends. Unity and solidarity on the menu,"" Michel wrote on the social network X. (27 August)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Visit from the EU Info Centre Belgrade,"How to successfully inform audiences from countries with EU-candidate status about Brussels? This was only one of the many topics a delegation from the ""EU Info Centre Belgrade"" talked about with the European Newsroom (enr) on August 30. Deputy Team Leader Aleksandar JovanÄiÄ‡, Media Officer Goran Stupar and Web EditorÂ NebojÅ¡a ParkiÄ‡ from the Belgrade EU Info Centre visited the European Newsroom in the premises in the Residence Palace in Brussels to gain insights into the collaboration between news agencies and the projectâ€™s goals.The main purpose of the visit was to get to know the enr project's implementation, considering the fact that such an initiative has been attempted  for the first time. The enr discussed the first results, the perception of the publics in the EU countries about the EU enlargement and what role of European media play in this context. Among the main topics discussed were how the enr works with agencies from both EU member states as well as countries that want to join the bloc. The enr discussed in detail the editorial processes as well as that it finds consensus in finding topics that are of great significance for audiences across Europe. The enr offered its Key Story to the EU Info Centre, which can be published on their website in order to inform the Serbian audience. The participating enr agency Tanjug translates the enr Key Story into the Serbian language and provides the article also to the Belgrade Info Centre. The EU Info Centre Belgrade dedicates itself to disseminating information about the European Union and fostering a connection between the EU and Serbian citizens. The visit was part of the Pulse of Europe, which organises media trips to the EU. The EU-funded project aims to actively support Serbian journalists to report on the best European practices. Its foremost aim is to educate Serbian citizens to bring them closer to the EU and thereby bridging the gap between them and the EU. So far, some 29 media trips to 16 EU countries were realised.",1
McKinsey: Europe's carmakers need new China strategy," According to consultancy McKinsey, the European car industry has lost around 5 percentage points of market share in the Chinese car market since 2019. In other news: The European Court of Human Rights found that the current political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina prioritizes ethnic representation. As a result, elections are undemocratic. Bulgaria stressed its ambitions concerning its Schengen membership during the Strategic Forum.Munich (dpa) – According to management consultants McKinsey, the European car industry needs a new China strategy. In the world's most important car market, European manufacturers have lost around 5 percentage points of market share since 2019, and new competitors hold a 51 percent share of the global market for e-cars. ""Greater adaptation to Chinese customer tastes with a strong focus on the latest technology, connectivity, driver assistance systems and consumer electronics"" could stop the erosion in China, industry experts wrote in a study published on August 30.More research and development in China are also needed. While European manufacturers need four years from concept to pilot phase of a car, the best Chinese manufacturers manage this in two years. At most 20 percent of the workforce in the European car industry have software skills, ""in the case of the challengers from the USA and China, the proportion is 45 percent,"" the study says. Chinese manufacturers have a cost advantage of 20 to 30 percent for e-cars. Energy costs for the European car industry are two to three times higher than in China and the USA.However, the European car industry ""can still act from a position of strength,"" says McKinsey industry expert Andreas Cornet. It generates three times as much turnover as the Chinese carmakers, scores with customer understanding, design and brands, employs 14 million people and is an innovation driver with 30 percent of all research and development spending in the EU. European manufacturers have announced more than 150 new e-models by 2030.However, the dependence on China for batteries is huge. ""90 percent of the capacity for refining lithium is in China, more than 70 percent of the cells are manufactured in China."" By 2030, a huge gap in batteries looms. ""Europe could be 500 GWh short of local capacity,"" the consultants write. Europe needs 20 additional battery factories, which cost 35 billion euros. The supply of semiconductors is also not secured. ""37 new plants with an investment volume of 190 billion euros could mitigate the risk."" In order to be at the forefront of driver assistance systems and autonomous driving, European companies should cooperate more in the use of data and the definition of technical standards, the expert added. (August 30)European Court of Human Rights: Elections in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) are undemocratic Sarajevo (FENA) – In the case of KovaÄeviÄ‡ v. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the European Court of Human Rights found that the current political system in Bosnia and Herzegovina prioritizes ethnic representation over political, economic, social, philosophical and other factors, which reinforces ethnic divisions in the country and undermines the democratic character of choice.The court stated that the international obligation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to reform the electoral system was unfulfilled. After becoming a member of the Council of Europe in 2002, Bosnia and Herzegovina undertook to ""within one year, with the help of the European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission), review the electoral legislation in accordance with the standards of the Council of Europe, and amend everything necessary.""Since then, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe has regularly reminded Bosnia and Herzegovina of this obligation and called on the country to adopt a new constitution with the aim of moving from the ""ethnic principle to the civic principle."" The court did not find any reason to depart from its judicial practice, especially from the rulings in the cases SejdiÄ‡ and Finci, ZorniÄ‡ and Pilav. In those, the court found discrimination against persons who do not belong to the ""constituent nations"" of Bosnia and Herzegovina and those who do not meet the combination of conditions of ethnic origin and place of residence with regard to their right to run for the House of Peoples and the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina.Slaven KovaÄeviÄ‡, who lives in the Bosniak-Croat Federation, complained that in the elections for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, his choice was limited to those candidates who declare themselves as Bosniaks and Croats. He was unable to choose any other candidates. At the same time, the residents of Republika Srpska only have the right to vote for those candidates who declare themselves as Serbs. In addition, those who do not declare themselves as members of the ""constituent peoples"" have no right to run for the presidency at all.The court took the position that real political democracy, based on the free right to vote, best contributes to the preservation of peace and dialogue. Therefore, as stated, voting in elections must be based on political and not ethnic criteria. Even if some forms of ethnic representation were to be retained, it is added that these would have to be secondary to political representation and should not discriminate against â€œother citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€.  (August 29) Bulgaria received strong support for its accession to Schengen at the Strategic Forum Bled (BTA) – Bulgaria's Schengen membership was the central topic of all bilateral meetings of the Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Maria Gabriel during the Strategic Forum in Bled. Hungary, France, Slovenia, Portugal, Sweden and Croatia expressed strong support for the country's accession.The panel ""EU – a leader in decision-making"" discussed the need for future reforms of the EU, enlargement and the expectations of the member states. Gabriel emphasized that the balance between expectations and results should be the focus of debates. The Schengen membership of Bulgaria and Romania and the criteria that both countries have been fulfilling for years was cited as an example.

"“International situation deteriorating”: EU faces record numbers of migrants
","The European Union faces the highest arrival of migrants since 2015 with record numbers of people arriving in Italy and Greece, putting reception mechanisms under severe strain. This year, member states reached a historic deal on key asylum and migration laws as deals with transit countries are struck. The EU has launched a legal procedure against Hungary. News of drowning migrants in the Mediterranean, arrested rescue ships and inhumane treatment of migrants, as recently in Greece, have been at the centre of media and criticism from civil society, NGOs and politicians.European intervention is needed to prevent the deterioration of the international situation from driving more and more migrants and refugees to Europe, said Italian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani as arrivals of irregular migrants to the European Union have increased significantly in recent months with several countries in southern Europe experiencing a doubling in numbers.â€œThe international situation is deteriorating, pushing people to leave Africa and seek a place in Europe through the Balkan and Mediterranean routes,â€ Tajani said on Sunday. â€œWe are working to control the situation, but action is needed from the EU.â€ Italyâ€™s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni declared a nationwide state of emergency in April.The international situation is deteriorating, pushing people to leave Africa and seek a place in Europe through the Balkan and Mediterranean routes.Antonio Tajani, Italian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister A spokesperson of the European Commission said in August that the Commission was â€œaware of the increaseâ€ and was working with Italian authorities to help decongest the Lampedusa hotspot. Further, â€œthe EU agencies Frontex, the European Asylum Agency (EUAA) and Europol have 450 people deployed in Italy.â€European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for more agreements with partner countries outside the bloc to control immigration. ""We must work more closely with the countries of origin and the transit countries,"" she said in July. Europe should invest more in stabilising the economies of North African countries ""and, together with them, fight more consistently against the organised crime of smugglers and traffickers"", she added.Every second irregular migrant comes via Central Mediterranean RouteThe Central Mediterranean Route remains the most popular for migrants in the first seven months of 2023. Those using the route often embark in North Africa and Turkey, crossing the Mediterranean Sea to reach Italy. 89,047, which are more than half of the entry attempts, were registered on this route, according to the European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex.The agency further stated that the increased migratory pressure on this route could continue in the coming months, as smugglers offer lower prices for Mediterranean passage in the face of fierce competition among criminal groups. However, Frontex noted that the Mediterranean Sea remains dangerous, in the first seven months of this year more than 2,060 migrants went missing. According to the International Organisation for Migration, more than 1,800 people have died this year in shipwrecks on the central Mediterranean migration route, the world's deadliest.In Italy, for example, the number of migrants arriving by boat in 2023 has surpassed 100,000 in mid-August. By August 23, some 105,909 people arrived by sea according to the Italian Interior Ministry. In the same time frame last year 51,328 people arrived. The main country from where migrants depart to reach Italy in 2023 is Tunisia. Should people continue to arrive in such high numbers, the overall yearly figure could top 2016â€™s record of 181,000. Doubling numbersThe Spanish Canary Islands have also seen an increase in boats departing on the migratory route from West Africa to the islands. In August, 2,692 people were rescued or arrived on the Canary coast according to Canarian authorities, more than double compared to July. NGOs forecast that this increase will continue over the next months, due to the good weather conditions, the political crisis in Senegal, the instability in the Sahel and famines in many African regions.The Greek Migration Ministry, too, has registered a significant increase in the number of people crossing from the Turkish Aegean coast to various Greek islands in recent weeks. According to the ministry, 6,669 migrants were living in the reception centres on the islands of Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos in mid-August. Their number has more than doubled compared to August last year when the number was 2,964.Belgium faces an acute asylum crisis as the number of people arriving in the country has rapidly risen from last year, putting pressure on an already creaking system. As a result, single male asylum seekers will no longer be given shelter after the government announced a temporary suspension on Tuesday.The Western Balkans route remains the second most popular route to reach the EU, according to Frontex. Photo: Kemal Softic/AP/dpaWestern Balkan route still popular, EU launches legal procedure against HungaryFrontex reported a decline along the second most popular route, the Western Balkan route - which refers to irregular arrivals to the EU via the region comprising Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. There were more than 52,200 detections, a drop of 26 percent, largely due to tighter visa policies.While numbers in migration camps in southern Bosnia and Herzegovina have decreased significantly, the country continues to function as a transit area for migrants on their way to the European Union. Trends forecast a continuous influx, also due to neighbouring Croatia entering the Schengen area in January 2023.In Slovenia, the number of recorded illegal entries between January and July increased significantly compared to 2022. Data released by police showed an increase from 10,103 to 26,871. Croatia remained the main entry point for illegal entries, accounting for 25,431 of the intercepted cases compared to 8,330 in the same period last year.Meanwhile, the situation in terms of numbers in Serbia remains unchanged. Since the beginning of the year, around 73,000 migrants passed through Serbia's reception centres.In bordering Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orbanâ€™s government released 1,400 convicted people smugglers from prison and gave them three days to leave the country in April. Last month, the European Commission launched a legal procedure against Hungary.EUâ€™s migration policy: a historic deal on a difficult path The EU has taken a number of actions to tackle irregular migration.  After years of fighting, EU member states struck a historic deal on two key pieces of legislation included in the New Pact on Asylum and Migration in June. The comprehensive reform of the blocâ€™s asylum policy has been described as historic. The pact was proposed by the European Commission in 2020 in order to create a fairer, efficient and more sustainable migration and asylum process for the bloc.According to the new plan, asylum applications would be processed within twelve weeks and all migrants must be distributed among the 27 EU states on the basis of GDP and population. The goal is to achieve 30,000 relocations per year.The compromise sets a new solidarity mechanism and stipulates that the acceptance of refugees should no longer be voluntary, but obligatory. Countries that do not want to take in refugees would be forced to pay 20,000 Euro compensation per person. In an event of crisis, the Commission would decide whether a country needs solidarity in the case of a boom of arrivals.The deal constitutes the basis of negotiations by the Council presidency with the European Parliament. Nevertheless, it faced a first setback on July 26, when EU member states failed to agree on a key aspect of the planned migration pact, concerning rules for migration and asylum specifically in crisis situations.The Spanish EU presidency, supported by Italy among others, had suggested a compromise which failed to gain support from several countries (Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Austria). Germany, Slovakia, and the Netherlands said they would abstain after expressing concerns that the standard for granting asylum might be lowered by the regulation.Poland, which is vehemently opposing the new asylum policy is planning to hold a referendum on the same day as their parliamentary elections on October 15. The government will ask citizens to give their view on planned reforms to the EU's asylum policy, including whether it should be mandatory for member states to take in a quota of migrants. However, the outcome will have no effect on the EU reform plans.Tunisian President Saied receives Dutch Prime Minister Rutte (left), President of the European Commission von der Leyen and Italian Prime Minister Meloni (right).

The European Commission wants to expand its cooperation with Tunisia in migration policy in a bid to stem the growing flow of migrants and refugees transiting through or departing directly from Tunisia en route to Europe via Italy.While many criticise the memorandum as unethical and â€œhighly problematicâ€, also due to Tunisia's inhumane treatment of migrants, others describe it as a right step to permanently reduce immigration numbers in Europe. Italian Prime Minister Meloni described the memorandum as ""a model of partnership"" with the countries of North Africa.The EU Commission wants to make 105 million Euro available for search and rescue operations and the repatriation of migrants and 150 million Euro in subsidies for the Tunisian state budget. In addition, the country can hope for cheap loans of up to 900 million Euro for long-term economic and financial stabilisation.The five pillars of the memorandum – macro-financial assistance, economic relations, energy cooperation, migration, contacts between people – follow the Commission's strategy which includes all-round agreements that accompany cooperation in the fight against traffickers with a strong acceleration in economic and sustainable energy supply policies.The agreement ""is an investment in our shared prosperity, stability and future generations"", was the comment of Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.This article is published weekly.

Polish military poster featuring Prigozhin is a photomontage,"A photomontage claiming to be a recruitment poster for the Polish army has been circulating on social media in several languages, including in Polish. It says that ""Poland is the shield of Europe"" and uses an image of Yevgeny Prigozhin -- the late leader of the Russian mercenary group Wagner -- to invite Poles to ""protect Europe from Russia's folly"". But AFP was able to locate the original photo, which in fact shows a bank advertisement on a tram stop in the southern Polish city of Krakow. Poland's defence ministry, the city's public transportation authority and the advertising company involved all denied the existence of a Prigozhin recruitment poster.""The defence ministry has launched a publicity campaign whose slogan is the following: Poland is the shield of Europe. Protect Europe from this crazy Russian,"" claims a tweet published on July 4. Alongside the text is a photo of a poster at a public transportation stop. ""Polish ads recruiting Polish conscripts are relying on a fear of Yevgeny Prigozhin and Wagner,"" added a Facebook post published that same day. On the poster, we can see a photo of Prigozhin -- who was killed last month in a plane crash after staging a short-lived mutiny -- inside a red general prohibition symbol, against a background of flames. Up top, we can see a small white-red Polish flag and below, the logo of the Polish defence ministry and a phone number for the recruitment centre. The banner also features large text reading: ""Poland -- the shield of Europe"" and ""Voluntary military service. Let's protect Europe against crazy Russia."" The last word is in red and barely legible. Screenshot taken on X (ex-Twitter) on July 10, 2023 The same photomontage has also been circulating since early July 2023 in Russian, on VK and Telegram -- where the post has garnered 45,000 views -- as well as in Slovak, Spanish, French, English and Turkish. Since staging their rebellion against Moscow's military leadership in June, Wagner fighters have taken refuge in Belarus, prompting concerns from neighbouring Poland and the Baltic states. Warsaw decided to reinforce its eastern border with additional troops. Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, the Polish army has continually boosted its numbers. While it is true that the Polish army is recruiting, the poster featuring Prigozhin is a photomontage. The defence ministry has been carrying out a recruitment campaign since May 2023 under the slogan ""Enlist in voluntary military service"". None of the posters featured in the campaign, which can be viewed on the recruitment centre's Facebook page (here, here), reference Prigozhin.We were also immediately struck by two details on the Prigozhin poster: a clear syntax error -- it says ""Polska tarcza Europy"" instead of ""Polska tarczÄ… Europy"" -- and the use of Poland's +48 country code to prefix the phone number targeting Polish residents.  Old tram stopTo locate the original photo, we tried various reverse image searches. They led us to a tweet from the head of the Polish army's central recruitment centre in which he denied the Prigozhin claim, labelling it as ""fake news"". The searches also turned up an article from Konkret24 debunking the same claim. To determine the provenance of the photo, we searched the Internet for Polish cities where the public transportation stops resemble the one in the image. This brought us to Krakow, where the majority of stops are blue -- only the new ones are silver.We tried to find the tram stop in question by analysing online route charts. However, we discovered that there is currently no stop featuring all of the lines from the photo (11, 18, 23, 52 and 62). No surprise there, as the tram routes are frequently switched up. In fact, it turns out that line number 23 has been abolished and no longer serves the Ruczaj neighbourhood. That is according to a statement from the city of Krakow. This gave us the impression that the photo must have been taken before 2018 yet after 2012, when the line was launched.  Contacted by AFP, the spokesman for ZTP -- the public transport authority in Krakow -- Sebastian Kowal confirmed on July 6, 2023 that the photo used in the photomontage must have been taken before 2018 as line 23 stopped serving Ruczaj that year. He added that the photo showed the Chmieleniec tram stop, which he recognised as he was acquainted with the neighbourhood. ""There is definitely no such banner displayed at any of our stops,"" he said. We proceeded to analyse the photo by enlarging it. On one of the tram stop windows, we were able to identify the two last letters of the logo of the AMS advertising company, which has been handling Krakow's public transportation stops for a decade. Screenshot from Facebook (top). Screenshot from the lovekrakow website.  Comparison made by AFP on July 10, 2023 We reached out to AMS to ask whether such a billboard was present at any of their stops in Krakow. A spokeswoman, Ilona Kondrat, told AFP on July 6 that ""it must be a photomontage made using an old photo, especially since this stop looks different today after some changes.""As evidence, she sent us a recent photo of the stop. ""Since June 2, 2023, the stop has had a banner marking the occasion of a sports event,"" she added. The event in question was the 3rd European Games, informally known as Krakow-Malopolska 2023.Screenshot from Facebook (left). Photo of the tram shelter from June 2, 2023, provided by AMS. Comparison made by AFP on July 10, 2023Photo actually shows bank adWe were finally able to find the original image by doing several reverse image searches on Yandex of a Krakow tram stop resembling the one from the Prigozhin claim. The original photo appeared among dozens of ""similar results"" suggested by Yandex on the basis of a photo of a tram stop on an advertising agencyâ€™s site. This photo shows an ad for a Polish bank and not a poster featuring Prigozhin. We can see the same tram lines, the same small piece of paper on the grass and the same banner with the AMS logo on the tram stop window. Screenshot from Facebook (left). Photo of the tram shelter found on Yandex. Comparison made by AFP on July 10, 2023 New photo searches then led us to two sites: a Pinterest page and a Ukrainian blog post about Krakow's public transportation, written eight years ago by Mariia Finko, a Ukrainian who moved to Poland in 2015 and writes about expat life on the site, called ""Podrozujemy razem"" (We travel together). The last photo from the article shows the Chmieleniec stop and corresponds to our original photo. We reached out to Finko to ask her whether she took the photo, but we had not received a response at the time of publication. Contacted by AFP, Poland's defence ministry said: ""Neither the ministry nor institutions subordinate to the defence ministry that are tasked with recruiting candidates for the Polish army are the authors of this banner."" The ministry's press office added on July 5 that ""our logo was illegally used or forged... This is yet another example of fake news."" ""We constantly call on media representatives and social media users to be particularly careful regarding the credibility of information,"" it added.  The head of the Poland's central military recruitment centre (CWCR), Miroslaw Brys, warned Twitter users against the photomontage on July 5. ""Another fake campaign promoted by Russian media. This time targeting voluntary service. Russian propaganda continues to try to sow chaos,"" he tweeted, asking that Internet users refrain from spreading the ""fake news"". AFP has also debunked other misinformation related to the war in Ukraine, which you can find here.Maja CZARNECKAAll articlesAFP PolskaAll articles War in Ukraine Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

"Europe in brief: Gentiloni believes agreement on Stability and Growth Pact will be reached by the end of the year
","For the European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni, there should be no further postponements on the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. In other news: The city of Brussels is worried about security, as Belgium decided to no longer house single men seeking asylum. Also: Charles Michel insists on setting 2030 as the date for EU-Enlargement.Cernobbio (ANSA) – Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni is optimistic that an agreement on the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) can be found by the end of the year. Also, the alternative (certainly not encouraging for Italy) would be a return to the past rules that have already demonstrated their limits. â€œWe must find an agreement by the end of the year on fiscal rules, on the Stability and Growth Pact. I am satisfied that governments are working on the basis of the Commissionâ€™s proposal and I am optimistic, if you want out of necessity, that it will be possible to reach an agreement by the end of the year,â€ said European Commissioner for the Economy Paolo Gentiloni.A lack of agreement on the Stability and Growth Pact with â€œa return to the previous situation would highlight the difficulties of the previous rules,â€ which, â€œdespite having some certainly useful and positive elements, have failed to encourage growth or to reduce debt, so proposing them again would certainly not be ideal,â€ emphasized Gentiloni. Under the old EU spending rules, public deficits of the member states are not supposed to exceed 3 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and debt levels should remain below 60 percent of GDP. According to these rules, states must annually repay 5 percent of the debt exceeding the 60 percent limit.""We decided to suspend the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact on 17 March 2020, a few days after the beginning of the pandemic, we prolonged this, I would say quite easily, in 2021, with some discussion in 2022, and, with a lot of discussions in 2023, we will not prolong it,"" Gentiloni clarified. The Commission's new proposal, which the 27 member states are discussing, maintains the previous objective of limiting debt, but envisages specific debt-relief plans for each country. Based on some technical simulations from Brussels, the adjustment of the Italian accounts could result in a reduction of the structural deficit by 0.85 percent per year in case of a 4-year plan, and by an average of 0.45 percent in case of a 7-year plan. (2 September).Controversy in Belgium over asylum, Brussels is worried about securityBrussels (AFP) – On Thursday, the Brussels region asked the Belgian government to reverse its decision to no longer house single men seeking asylum, a measure which it believes risks increasing the number of homeless people and threatens security in the European capital.In a press release, the regional government drew a link between the asylum crisis in Belgium and the presence of ""very large numbers of homeless people"" on the streets of the capital, particularly around major railway stations.â€œThe Brussels government must note that for several years, the health, social and safety situation in a number of districts has been deteriorating as a result of factors over which it has little institutional control,â€ the press release says, citing â€œdrug trafficking and the crime that goes with it, as well as the presence of large numbers of homeless people, asylum seekers or people without residence permits.â€In particular, affected areas include the districts around the railway stations Gare du Nord and Gare du Midi. (August 31)Charles Michel insists on setting 2030 as date for EU-EnlargementBrussels (EFE) – On Thursday, the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, reiterated his call to set 2030 as a date for EU-Enlargement.""Setting a date pushes the EU to prepare and gives the Western Balkans a concrete timetable to deliver on their part. No more excuses on either side,â€ Michel said in a meeting with media in Brussels, in which he defended his speech last Monday in Slovenia. There, Michel had advocated for an EU-Enlargement to include new states by 2030, a goal from which the European Commission has distanced itself, preferring, like European Parliament President Roberta Metsola, not to set dates.However, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, supported the idea. ""I think it is good to set a political objective, a horizon, to give political impetus to the process. And also for us, because, yes, we have to be prepared for an agreement that could affect ten more members of the European Union,â€ Borrell told a press conference at the end of the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers held in Toledo (Spain), although he did not give any specific date.

Africa Climate Summit: Billions of investments in climate protection,"More investment and less debt in the name of climate: These demands on rich countries were being voiced at Africa's first climate summit in Kenya. The continent is vulnerable to the growing impacts of climate change, though not a victim, stressed its leaders, but rather a long-ignored ally in the fight against global warming.Africaâ€™s leaders urged the international community to back a surge in renewable energy and called for sweeping changes to the global financial system as they wrapped up a landmark at the first Africa Climate Summit (ACS) in Nairobi.""This continent emits only four percent of global emissions, but suffers some of the worst effects (...): extreme heat, relentless flooding and tens of thousands of deaths from devastating droughts,"" UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres said in a speech.However, a massive scaling up in funding is needed to unlock green growth across the continent ""on a scale that can contribute meaningfully to decarbonisation of the global economyâ€œ, the African leaders said at the summit that was organised by the Kenyan government and the African Union.The Nairobi Declaration was adopted on the final day of the summit by more than 20 African states. In it they called for concrete action on reforms that lead to ""a new financing architecture that is responsive to Africa's needs"", including debt restructuring and relief. It also reiterates the calls on the rich countries to deliver the still unfulfilled commitment from last yearâ€™s COP27 to mobilise 100 billion Dollars a year: To help the Global South in the face of the climate crisis as well as committing to attract more investment in clean energy.EUâ€™s von der Leyen: â€˜Public funding is not enoughâ€™Efforts at the summit to up investment in renewables were given a boost on Tuesday, attracting a total of 23 billion Dollars in funding pledges.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen underlined the importance of mobilising private capital on a large scale for the African economy to accelerate the transition towards clean energy: â€œTogether with the European Investment Bank and our member states, we are going to allocate 1 billion Euro to reduce the risk of private investment in emerging markets,â€ she said at the summit, adding that â€on the green transition, public funding is not enoughâ€. The European goal is to allocate half of the 'Global Gatewayâ€™, a 300-billion-euro investment plan, to the African continent.Within that framework, Von der Leyen announced the conclusion of an agreement with the Kenyan President, William Ruto, to continue promoting green hydrogen technology.""With your enormous potential for renewable energy, your essential raw materials, your incredible nature and biodiversity, and your young workforce, you can help clean up the global energy and supply systems, while creating the good jobs and economic opportunities that your people demand,"" said Von der Leyen.The European leader called on African countries to work in synergy and to present ""a proposal for the establishment of a global carbon priceâ€œ at the next UN Climate Change Conference (COP28). That summit will take place from November 30 until December 12, 2023, in Dubai.European Commission President Ursula von Der Leyen attends the opening session during the Africa Climate Summit 2023 at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi on September 5, 2023. (Photo by Luis Tato / AFP)Italy and Slovenia vow for more partnership with AfricaSlovenia, soon to become a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 2024 and 2025, committed 4.7 million Euro in multilateral climate finance assistance in 2022. This amount represents a 58 percent increase in bilateral assistance compared to 2021. According to the Slovenian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a strong partnership with Africa should be one of the key priorities of the EU's foreign policy, it said on Wednesday.Meanwhile, Italy announced at the summit the long-term global initiative Youth4Climate, co-led by Italy and other partners including the United Nations Development Programme (Undp), aiming to increase youth participation. ""Italy's presence in Nairobi is of considerable strategic importance and strongly reconfirms the central role that Africa plays in Italian foreign policy. Geographical proximity, historical ties, economic and cultural ties bind Italy to the African continent,"" said Undersecretary Claudio Barbaro of the Italian Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (Mase). He led the Italian delegation to the climate summit in Nairobi. The country approved multilateral and bilateral projects for a total of over 120 million Euro.Global overhaulAfrican countries, facing mounting debt costs and a dearth of funds, have called for a complete overhaul of the global financial architecture. This is adding to pressure already on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank to unlock investment and climate finance.Ruto said it was time to overhaul global financial systems that ""perpetually place African nations on the back foot"". ""We demand a fair playing ground for our countries to access the investment needed to unlock the potential and translate it into opportunities,"" he said.Despite an abundance of natural resources, just three percent of energy investments worldwide are made in Africa. The final declaration said the continent would need a ""tenfold increase in the finance capital flowing"" into renewables in the next seven years, some 600 billion Dollars, to achieve the aim of boosting renewables from 56 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to at least 300 GW by 2030.On Tuesday, the United Arab Emirates promised 4.5 billion dollars in clean energy investments in Africa – the most significant pledge so far. COP28 president and UAE oil executive Sultan Al Jaber said the funding would ""jumpstart a pipeline of bankable clean energy projects in this very important continent"".A continent with â€˜opportunities worth millionsâ€™The summit seeks to highlight the ""opportunities worth millions"" that, according to Ruto, Africa can seize if getting more involved in global climate action. ""A new Africa is there and it means business,"" Ruto said.The continent possesses indispensable resources for the development of renewable energies, such as 40 percent of the world's cobalt, manganese and platinum reserves and 60 percent of the world's best solar resources.""Africa possesses both the potential and the ambition to be a vital component of the global solution to climate change,"" said the final declaration from the meeting, on behalf of the African Union (AU).The closing statement includes not only calls on the international community for ""emission reductions"", but also listed general outlines made by African governments, such as developing policies and incentives to ""attract local, global and regional investments"".Consensus is hard-won across Africa, a diverse continent of 1.4 billion people where some governments are championing a renewable-powered future while others defend their reserves of fossil fuels. But leaders had ""adopted unanimously"" the declaration, said AU Commission head Moussa Faki Mahamat. Through the Nairobi Declaration, Africa aims to articulate a unified voice ahead of various forums, such as the COP28 climate summit in Dubai or the UN General Assembly.This article is published weekly.

"Europe in brief: Refugees’ claim rejected, effects of the Digital Markets Act and EU-Africa allyship at COP28
","A first-ever claim for compensation brought against European Border and Coast Guard Agency Frontex by a family of Syrian refugees has been rejected by the European Court of Justice. The Digital Markets Act forces big technology companies to comply with the EUâ€™s antitrust laws. EU Commission President Von der Leyen wants Africa as ally at UN climate conference.EU: Syrian refugees' claim for compensation against Frontex rejectedBrussels (AFP) – On Wednesday, the European Court of Justice rejected a claim for compensation brought against Frontex by a family of Syrians after they were turned back from Greece to Turkey, ruling that the EU's border guard agency was not liable for their damages.This is the first time that the European courts have ruled on such a claim, while the practice of illegally turning back migrants at the EU's external borders is regularly denounced by international organisations and reported in the media. The Kurdish family from Syria with four young children, now living in Iraq, had arrived on a Greek island in 2016.They were sent back to Turkey on a flight organised jointly by the Greek state and Frontex, even though, according to their lawyers, their asylum application had not yet been processed. They were claiming more than 96,000 euros for material and 40,000 euros for non-material damages. (6 September 2023)European Commission requires six major technology companies to comply with antitrust lawBrussels (EFE) – This Wednesday, the European Commission (EC) ruled to force Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft to comply with the Digital Markets Act, the new antitrust regulation of the European Union (EU) aimed at controlling the market power of big technology companies.All of the six companies meet the requirements of being covered by the law: they operate in at least three EU countries and either had a turnover in Europe of at least 7.5 billion euros in the last three years, or a market value of 75 billion in the last financial year, or at least 45 million active users and more than 10,000 business users per year. The EC therefore believes that they have sufficient power to distort the market, so in the next six months they will have to meet the criteria established by the EU with the aim of guaranteeing free competition in the digital economy.Specifically, 22 of the services offered by the companies will have to comply with the criteria. These include social networks Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and LinkedIn, messaging systems WhatsApp and Messenger, video platform YouTube, search engine Google Search and browsers Chrome and Safari. Also affected are operating systems iOS, Android and Windows, services Google Play and Google Shopping, Amazon Marketplace, Meta Marketplace, the mobile app shops of Apple (App Store) and Google (Google Play) as well as the online advertising tools of Google, Amazon and Meta.

The Commission President also wants to reach out to Africans to develop green bond markets on the continent.These were all levers to help attract private capital for green investments in Africa, von der Leyen argued. In her speech, she presented the green transition as an engine for economic development on the African continent with its enormous potential for renewable and green hydrogen and a wealth of crucial raw materials.According to von der Leyen, this would also be a good thing for Europe. That is why the European Union, through its international investment program Global Gateway, is pumping billions into the green transition in Africa. For example, von der Leyen announced 12 million euros for the development of green hydrogen in the host country Kenya on Tuesday on the sidelines of the summit.Belgian MEP Kathleen Van Brempt (Vooruit) agreed with von der Leyen that an alliance with Africa was crucial in the fight against climate change. The MEP said she was also satisfied that von der Leyen emphasised reciprocal partnerships, but â€œthis also requires clear commitments on our part.â€Van Brempt recalled that rich countries had failed to live up to their financial commitments in the past. â€œThe promised climate support is lagging behind. A clear strategy on how to share our technology with African countries is also missing. Both are crucial elements in that approach.

EU not planning ban on toilet paper,"The European Union is taking steps to encourage the sustainable production of paper, but it is not proposing to ban toilet paper. False claims circulated in Polish in August 2023 that the EU is planning to phase out toilet paper, first by replacing it with a product made from straw, and then by banning it altogether. However, a European Commission spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the EU has ""no intention of banning toilet paper"". AFP could find no such announcement of any ban and paper industry representatives said they were not aware of any such move. While toilet paper made from straw instead of wood pulp is now on the market, there is no move to force EU countries to use it or ban other types.  As Poland's political parties began to campaign ahead of the general election on October 15, EU environment plans became a subject of criticism and debate. The far-right Confederation party used its programme to call ""to stop the eco-madman from the EU"" while the governing Law and Justice (PiS) party accused the EU of dictating forest management. The EU and its supposed attempts to control people's everyday lives is a frequent topic of misinformation. AFP has already debunked false claims that Brussels has a clandestine plan to make people eat insects as well as misinformation concerning European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (here). This time, unfounded claims about a plan to ""ban"" toilet paper appeared in traditional news outlets as well as on social media.  ""Let's start with another absurd idea of European Union officials, explained by the fight against climate change. Well -- this is unfortunately not a joke -- Brussels wants to ban the use of toilet paper. First, it would be replaced with a substitute made of straw, and eventually phased out completely,"" a TVP3 Opole presenter said on August 16, 2023 when introducing a report on the supposed ban. The channel's Facebook post featuring a video clip of the report gained more than 300,000 views and more than 2,400 comments. Most comments were hostile to the EU. For example: ""Leave the Union. Referendum"" and ""Poland out of the EU"".Screenshot taken on Facebook on August 22, 2023The Polish TV report was televised as part of a longer news broadcast the same day (at the 1:08 minute mark). The news programme on which it was shown, Kurier Opolski, was aired by TVP3 Opole, a regional offshoot of Polish public television TVP. We did not find a trace of the report on the national edition of TVP. The TVP3 Opole report cites ""European media"" as speculating about the straw-based substitute and the eventual ban. In a vox pop, Poles are asked what they think about the EU plan. The report also questions the logic of a supposed EU move to replace toilet paper with bidets.Contacted by AFP, the director of TVP3 Opole answered in an email on September 7 that ""TVP3 Opole does not comment on this matter.""Misleading suggestions that the EU wants to ban toilet paper or replace it with straw-based paper and bidets appeared in many other articles, for example here, here, here and here.Many Polish social media users shared the claims on Twitter (here and here) and Facebook (here and here). Some of the claims refer to Spanish media as the source of the story. Screenshot taken on Facebook on August 24, 2023 Claims in Slovak suggested that ""traditional toilet paper"" would be phased out and replaced with paper made from straw (here, here), again citing Spanish media reports. Source of the claims?Searching for articles in different languages about a ""ban"" on toilet paper, we found what appeared to be a joke article in Romanian from media company Mediafax published on April 1, 2023 -- April Fools' Day. It features the date in large font at the top of the story and uses spoof quotes from high-profile figures including von der Leyen who are quoted as saying that toilet paper will be banned across the EU and ""Japanese toilets"" introduced.  A few months later, apparently serious claims began to circulate in Polish that the EU was promoting toilet paper made from straw and that a ""complete abandonment of toilet paper was not ruled out"". Those claims (for example here, here and here) were published on August 9 citing a report from the Polish Press Agency (PAP) correspondent in Spain. AFP obtained a copy of the PAP report published on August 9 entitled ""Spain/Media: Brussels promotes straw toilet paper to tackle the climate crisis"". It quotes an article from El Economista, a Spanish economic newspaper founded in 2006 by the conservative newspaper El Mundo. However, while both the El Economista article and the PAP report did speculate that traditional toilet paper's days might be numbered and referred to alternatives such as straw-based paper or bidets, they did not say anything about an EU ban. The PAP report appears to refer to an El Economista report from July 29 which has no byline and contains very little context to support its statements. Instead, it seems to be a promotional article extolling the virtues of a bidet device produced by a company from Ecuador. The article includes a tweet from the company promoting its services. The only reference to the EU comes at the end of the El Economista report with the mention of an article from another Spanish site, Libre Mercado, about a supposed push from the EU towards toilet paper made from straw.The Libre Mercado article also makes no mention of any toilet paper ""ban"", although it makes the misleading claim that the EU is ""pushing"" for the introduction of straw toilet paper.Although straw toilet paper has received some funding from European banks to invest in sustainable development projects, the EU is not proposing that it replace other types of paper.EU says 'no intention of banning toilet paper' When asked about the claims, a spokesperson for the European Commission told AFP: ""The European Union has no intention of banning toilet paper. And there exists no proposal, neither current nor in the making, to ban it in the future.""The spokesperson added that while EU legislation does place requirements on toilet paper producers to protect the environment by ensuring their products do not use materials from deforestation areas, that does not amount to a ban on toilet paper. ""Toilet paper is indeed in the scope of the Deforestation Regulation. Products and their raw materials can be placed on and exported from the EU market only if they are legally produced and coming from deforestation-free areas,"" the spokesperson said in an email on August 24.The EU's Deforestation Regulation (archived link) states that the consumption of timber and other commodities such as palm oil, soybeans, cocoa, coffee, cattle and rubber is leading to ""global deforestation and forest degradation"". Most toilet paper is made from wood pulp.Article 3 of the legislation states that all of those commodities ""shall not be placed or made available on the market or exported"" unless they are deforestation-free and comply with laws in the country of production, as shown below.The legislation does not propose a ban on toilet paper made from wood pulp, or toilet paper in general. AFP could not find any reference to a ""ban"" on any kind of toilet paper products on the EU's website or any public announcement of such a plan.No plan for straw-based toilet paper across EU While the European Investment Bank (EIB), the EU's lending arm, and other financial institutions in Europe have provided funding to a company that is developing more eco-friendly toilet paper, this is just one of many circular economy projects that have received such backing. Contrary to numerous online reports, Brussels has not proposed a ban on the use of other types of toilet paper.Swedish group Essity produces toilet paper using straw at one of its factories in Mannheim, Germany, which itÂ announcedÂ in 2019.In an EIBÂ press releaseÂ (archivedÂ link)Â from July 2023, Essity is listed as one of the companies that has received support from a group of banks and institutions under the Joint Initiative on Circular Economy (JICE), to which the EIB also belongs.According to the EIB and Essity, JICE financing for Essity's project to produce straw toilet paper at a Mannheim factory came from the initiative's German bank KfW, which you can read about here (archivedÂ link).Separately, the EIBÂ announced in December 2021 a loan of 300 million eurosÂ to Essity for ""research, development and innovation"".EIB spokeswoman Vanessa Paul told AFP that the 300-million-euro loan was earmarked for around 115 research, development and innovation projects, none of which were related to any kind of ban on toilet paper.EssityÂ announcedÂ in a press release a loan of 300 million euros to support ""innovative products and investments in sustainable development in all business areas and product segments until 2024"".Essity spokesman Karl Stoltz told AFP in an email on September 1 that part of the funding had been used to develop the production of straw-based or alternative fibre-based paper products. Sustainable paper projects remain voluntaryThe European association representing the paper industry (CEPI) told AFP that it was ""not aware of any ban or project to ban or phase out toilet paper"".""None of the legislation already approved or in the course of approval under the umbrella of the 'Green Deal' (Fit-for-55, EU Deforestation regulation etc.) contains such a policy,"" CEPI forest policy manager Margherita Miceli told AFP in an email on August 23.""Indeed the project mentioned by the EIB press release is about incentivising circular economy projects including the use of by-products and residues as raw materials, but the participation in such projects is voluntary,"" she said.Maja CZARNECKAAll articlesAFP PolskaAll articles Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Von der Leyen's State of the Union address,"This week, attention will turn to the State of the Union speech that Ursula von der Leyen will give to the plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, the last of her current term. In other news: Slovenia's PM Golob calls for accession talks with Bosnia and Bulgariaâ€™s PM sees the euro as a stability factor against inflation.Von der Leyen's State of the Union address is expected to highlight accomplishments and look toward the remaining monthsBrussels (EFE) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will deliver her annual State of the European Union address in Strasbourg on Wednesday, September 13, which marks the start of the EUâ€™s political year. Although no major announcements are expected, von der Leyen is likely to review her milestones and claim her achievements over the past four, hectic years and lay the groundwork for the final months of her term. It is the last speech of this legislative term.https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1700171893884555399Looking ahead to the remaining months of its mandate, the European Commission has yet to present the expected dossiers, like the enlargement report that will evaluate the progress of the candidate countries for accession to the European Union, including Ukraine. Another dossier will look at the continent's decarbonisation objectives between now and 2040. In addition, the commissionâ€™s role will be key to the success of initiatives that are already being negotiated, such as the European regulation of artificial intelligence, the reform of EU tax rules, the final details of the legislation to make the EU climate neutral by 2050 or the pact on migration and asylum. (September 10)Slovenian premier urges opening of Bosnia accession talks this yearLjubljana (STA) - Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob has urged European Council President Charles Michel and EU heads of state to be more ambitious when it comes to the EU accession of Bosnia-Herzegovina, saying that the Council ""should decide on opening accession negotiations ... by the end of this year"".""The arguments for such a decision are, in my view, incomparably stronger than those against,"" Golob said in an open letter to Michel released by the government on Thursday. Such a decision would ""show our understanding of the strategic and stabilising value of the enlargement process, with both gaining relevance following the onset of war in Ukraine.""""We would also acknowledge the country's notable efforts to progress on its EU path,"" he said. Golob highlighted some positive trends in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including the passage of several laws, as he argued that the opening of the accession negotiations would ""insert an additional positive dynamic"" into the country's EU integration process.He stressed that with the war in Ukraine, EU enlargement has become ""a strategic choice and necessity"" and that the bloc should ""push back against malign actors in the Western Balkans"" by putting the region irreversibly on the EU's path of stability and prosperity.Bosnia-Herzegovina applied for EU membership in 2016 and received candidate status last December, under the condition that it adopt recommended measures to strengthen the rule of law, fight corruption and strengthen fundamental rights.Golob noted that this conditionality was unique and ""unknown to other accession countries"". Moreover, in the current political circumstances there the implementation of some conditions ""may ultimately challenge the political stability, and thus ultimately decrease the attention devoted to the EU integration process"". (September 7)Had Bulgaria adopted the Euro, inflation and interest rates would be lower today, Bulgarian PM Denkov claimsSOFIA (BTA) – â€œIf we had the euro today, inflation would be lower and interest rates would be lower,â€ Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said on the public broadcaster BNT, adding that adopting the euro is what will stabilise people's incomes. â€œBecause the euro is a stable currency that leads to lower interest rates than the lev at the moment,"" the Prime Minister explained. In his words, inflation and interest rates in the euro area are about twice lower than they are in Bulgaria. ""It is very important to stop living with some illusions and try to see what the real historical facts show. The big currencies - the dollar, the euro, they are more stable in this respect because there is a large volume that stabilises the currency,"" Denkov said.""The thesis that prices will not rise in general is absolutely wrong. Prices are rising, there is inflation,"" the Prime Minister said, referring to people's fears that the introduction of the euro would also raise prices. He said the important thing was that incomes should rise faster than inflation.According to him, the country needs a monopoly-free market economy and higher incomes, and these goals are reflected in this and next yearâ€™s budgets. ""So far we have proved with Finance Minister Assen Vassilev that we know how to collect revenues and how to raise people's incomes. We have shown it with several budgets and we will do it with Budget 2024,"" Denkov assured. (September 8)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

EU electricity market reform at a standstill over nuclear power row,"The European Parliament gave the green light to start negotiations with the Council of the EU to reform the Unionâ€™s electricity market. However, the Council is currently deadlocked due to disagreements, mainly between Germany and France, over the financing of nuclear energy.With a reform of the European electricity market, MEPs want to protect consumers more strongly against price fluctuations. Citizens should have the right to fixed price contracts as well as contracts with dynamic prices, according to the European Parliament's negotiating position adopted in Strasbourg on Thursday. Consumers should also be provided with more information on the options available to them.The basis for the parliamentary position was a legislative proposal from the European Commission in March. In mid-July, the European Parliament's Industry and Energy Committee amended the proposal – by strongly limiting the subsidies for the nuclear industry – in preparation for talks with the Member States to finalise the text. This mandate was approved by all MEPs on Thursday (366 votes in favour, 186 against, 18 abstentions). This position in the parliamentary committee could have been approved without a vote in plenary unless expressly opposed by at least 71 elected members. Exactly that happened, though, resulting in a formal vote with no possibility of amendments.The protest was led by members of the French EPP and Renew delegations, who felt that the text was too restrictive on nuclear power plantsâ€™ access to government-guaranteed pricing mechanisms and risked jeopardising the ""major overhaul"" of the French nuclear fleet. Slovenian, Romanian and Czech liberal Renew MEPs joined forces with the centre-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and radical left MEPs. They were unable to prevent the adoption of the text, which remained unchanged.With the reform of the electricity market, the European Commission wants to avoid exploding prices for consumers and promote the expansion of renewable energies. According to the proposal, long-term contracts for electricity generation from renewable energies and nuclear power are to be promoted in particular.However, there is no common position among EU countries yet. According to EU diplomats, there have been fears in the past that the French nuclear industry could be disproportionately favoured. So far, Germany and France have been at odds with each other.Council dispute on nuclear energy continuesThe electricity market reform has stalled in the Council because France is demanding that subsidies for the development of public-private Contracts for Difference (CfD) can also apply to existing nuclear activities. Those contracts work by the state agreeing with a producer on a fixed price for buying and selling electricity over a certain period, and then paying back the difference depending on whether the actual price was higher or lower than the fixed price. Germany, Austria, Luxembourg and Italy are against extending these to nuclear assets.Austria and Luxembourg oppose because of their historic opposition to nuclear power, Germany and Italy because of the particularity of the French electricity mix, with almost 80 percent being produced with atomic energy. Such a measure would benefit French companies over those in the rest of the continent as it would result in an automatic public subsidy for domestic energy producers in the event of a crisis, permanently shielding French companies from price fluctuations.Slovenia, like some other EU members gathered around France, will not agree to ""deprivileging nuclear energy, which is key to decarbonisation and the green transitionâ€œ, Sloveniaâ€™s Minister for Environment, Climate and Energy, Bojan Kumer, said. At the same time, this would also put upward pressure on prices, he added.Kumer welcomed the efforts of the Spanish Presidency to converge positions on electricity market reform. He stressed that the key is finding a common denominator and that both the German and French blocs need to work on this. On the use of CfDs, Slovenia is in favour of maximum flexibility. ""We want this to reach the ordinary consumer, not just business and industry,"" said Kumer, who also advocated effective control at European level, on the redistribution of revenues and subsidies.We want this to reach the ordinary consumer, not just business and industry.Bojan Kumer, Minister for Environment, Climate and Energy of SloveniaLast week, the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU distributed its first official proposal to pave the way for negotiations on the reform of the EU electricity market. The draft includes concessions to France while introducing controls to avoid market distortion, which is of particular concern to Germany.The Spanish Presidencyâ€™s new proposal focuses on those aspects where disagreement remains and, in particular, seeks to resolve the positions of Paris and Berlin on CfDs.The third vice-president of the Spanish government and Minister for Ecological Transition, Teresa Ribera, told the press in Brussels last week that she was confident that the Member States would be able to reach an agreement ""in a few weeks"", which would allow the final negotiations with the European Parliament to begin.Putting consumers first?The Spanish Presidencyâ€™s proposal defines the design features of the instruments to ensure the economic viability of the lifetime of nuclear plants. It also requires that the revenues from the Contracts for Difference are distributed to final customers.Furthermore, these contracts for difference must be designed to ensure that there is no under- or over-compensation; to determine the amounts of remuneration through a transparent and non-discriminatory tendering process and to avoid distortions of competition and trade in the internal market arising from the distribution of revenues to companies.It also establishes a remuneration scheme for consumers, especially companies, who would receive money based on their total consumption, without altering the incentives to reduce consumption or undermining competition between suppliers. The system would be overseen by the European Commission, which could impose limits on income redistribution for companies.New investments shall flow into new electricity generating installations or investments aimed at substantially extending their lifetime.A view of the world's largest floating offshore wind farm on the Gullfaks C oil rig in the North Sea. Foto: Ole Berg-Rusten/NTB/dpaMore renewable energyThe Spanish presidencyâ€™s draft definitions for economic viability of installations and how the revenues are distributed to consumers after adjustment of the CfD do not only regard nuclear energy. They also concern wind energy, solar energy, geothermal energy and hydroelectric energy without reservoirs. However, Member States may exempt small-scale renewable energy installations.On Tuesday, the European Parliament backed a significant expansion of renewable energy generation, calling for renewables to account for at least 42.5 percent of energy used across the European Union by 2030. Many European countries would need to dramatically increase renewable energy production to meet the target. In Germany, for instance, the share of renewable energies stood at 20.4 percent in 2022, according to government figures.On Wednesday in Strasbourg, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also announced a series of forthcoming measures to promote wind energy, stressing the need to speed up the issuing of permits.Before the electricity market reform can come into force, the EU countries still have to reach an agreement with the European Parliament.The objective is that the final version of the reform can be agreed with the European Parliament before the end of the year or early 2024. From then on the centre of power of the EU will enter a pre-electoral phase in view of the European Parliament elections in June 2024.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Germany suspends voluntary deal of migrant resettlement with Italy,"The German government has suspended an agreement with Italy to voluntarily take in refugees due to Italyâ€™s refusal to respect the Dublin rules. In other news: Slovenia and Luxembourg pledge for equal treatment of all EU candidates and the preservation of Schengen. Slovak and Hungarian police are combating illegal migration together. Berlin halts reception of migrants from ItalyBerlin (ANSA) – The procedures for the relocation of migrants from Italy to Germany within the voluntary solidarity mechanism have been halted, Rome was told in a letter in August. This was reported by German newspaper Die Welt, citing sources among German authorities. The German Interior Ministry also said in Die Welt that due to the ""strong migratory pressure towards Germany"" and the ""continued suspension of Dublin transfers, Italy has been informed"" that processes for selecting migrants for redistribution would be ""postponed until further noticeâ€œ. Migrants from Italy for whom there has already been authorisation from Germany in the past ""will continue to be acceptedâ€œ, the German ministry stressed. According to Die Welt, the suspension by Berlin is a reaction to Italy's refusal for months to authorise transfers according to the Dublin Regulation. It was referring to, for example, migrants who have arrived in Germany but for whom Italy was the first country of arrival. The German newspaper cites a letter written by the Italian government on December 5, 2022 to its EU partners, in which it officially said that ""transfers to Italy"" are ""temporarily cancelled"" due to ""technical reasons that have suddenly emerged and are related to the lack of reception capacityâ€œ. (September 12)Prime Ministers of Slovenia and Luxembourg demand equal treatment of EU candidates and preservation of SchengenLuxembourg (STA) - Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and his Luxembourg counterpart Xavier Bettel called for equal treatment for all countries wishing to join the EU. They also stressed the importance of maintaining Schengen for the economy at a meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday. The two leaders signed an agreement on strengthening cooperation in the field of space technologies.The prime ministers and their delegations discussed EU enlargement and the Unionâ€™s readiness to integrate new members. Golob argued that in the face of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, the enlargement process is becoming more of a geopolitical issue and less of a technical one. Slovenia made its position clear with the European Commission, which several other member states share: The Western Balkans should be treated equally with Ukraine and Moldova when it comes to enlargement. In addition to technical conditions, geopolitical realities must also be considered, the prime minister said. ""We do not want the Western Balkans to suddenly become a hostage of some foreign powers just because of a lack of attention from the Commission,"" Golob emphasised. Bettel also argued that all countries wishing to join the Union should be treated equally, but underlined the importance of fulfilling the conditions more. ""The rules are the same for all and I will insist on that,"" he said.  (September 12)Slovak and Hungarian police are expanding the scope of joint patrolsBratislava (TASR) – In order to combat illegal migration in Hungary and Slovakia from the Western Balkans route, the operation of joint patrols of the Hungarian and Slovak police on the territory of Hungary will be expanded. This comes after an amendment to an already existing agreement, the Slovak police announced on a social network. According to the police, this will help to intensify and streamline cooperation between police forces of the two countries. (September 11)BiHâ€™s Minister of Foreign Affairs: BiH has the opportunity to jump on the EU train so that benefits are felt by all citizensSarajevo (FENA) – Political representatives in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) still have an opportunity to bring the country on the European path, said BiH Minister of Foreign Affairs Elmedin KonakoviÄ‡ in Sarajevo, after a series of meetings with high-ranking European officials in Strasbourg.He stated that at the recent meeting at the forum in Bled, Slovenia, encouraging messages came from the European Union saying that the enlargement policy is very alive and active. A package of 14 billion Euro had been approved for the next seven years.â€œIn addition, an investment package of six billion Euro over the next three years has been approved, four of which will be aimed at improving the business environment in the Western Balkans, and two billion Euro are Grant funds. If BiH falls out of this package, BiH politicians and mostly politicians from the BiH entity Republika Srpska will have the greatest responsibility,â€ KonakoviÄ‡ said.He says the latest developments from the entity Republika Srpska concern European officials. The rhetoric and attitudes of the leaders of the Serbs from BiH are currently disrupting this country's path towards the European Union, KonakoviÄ‡ said, when much has already been done in the last seven months.He therefore appealed to the business community to put pressure on politicians because it was about opening up and accessing the Western Balkan countries to the European market. This would be a great opportunity for business development and a very important economic injection. â€œWe expect to get negotiations started in October, perhaps without a date, but we expect to go into the decision-making process. BiH has the opportunity to jump onto the EU train and make the benefits felt by all citizens of all BiH,â€ KonakoviÄ‡ added. (September 13)European Union supports Albania in population and housing censusTirana (ATA) - Prime Minister Edi Rama said that Albania will get support for the population and housing census. Albania needs to identify the total number of inhabitants and the number of real estate properties, he said. According to the prime minister, Albania will get support from its partners from France, Switzerland, Germany and Sweden. â€œThe EU is supporting the substantial fund with 45 percent, and the remainder comes from the Albanian government,â€ Rama said.â€œHigh technology guarantees the integrity of figures in real-time. The Albanian statistics office INSTAT has undoubted institutional experience and a professional consistency that is a guarantee in this processâ€, he added. The Albanian Prime Minister also noted that Albania has the most advanced European legislation for minorities. (September 14)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Europe heat records not due to change in temperature readings,"In response to the record high temperatures in Europe and elsewhere around the world this summer, social media users accused the European Space Agency (ESA) of having modified its measurement methods to achieve the striking results. They claimed that the agency was now measuring the land surface temperature, which is higher than air temperature. However, this is a misinterpretation of an ESA article about the heatwave. The institution has not made changes to its methodology and had in fact already published land surface temperature data in the past. What's more, the ESA is not responsible for validating temperature records. That is the role of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which uses other measurements that it receives from weather stations.This summer saw many regions of the northern hemisphere experience extreme heat for long durations, including the United States, southern Europe, north Africa and China. In fact, July 2023 was the hottest month ever recorded on Earth, according to the EU's climate monitoring service Copernicus.Experts and UN have pointed to the link between these heatwaves and climate change, yet some social media argued instead that the temperature increase was due to a change in methodology.""The heat records have been 'shattered' because the ESA has begun to use land surface temperatures instead of air temperatures,"" someone posted to X (formerly Twitter) on July 20, earning more than 2,000 retweets.The allegation was also made on Facebook: ""This is how the ghouls (globalists) manipulate temperature readings to make you believe their lies"". Screenshot taken on Twitter on July 21, 2023 Many internet users made reference to Climate Science Journal's July 14 reply on X to a tweet from Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Screenshot taken on Twitter on July 21, 2023 Based in London, Climate Science Journal describes itself as a site that is all ""about restoring integrity to the study of climate change"" and challenging the greenhouse gas theory, which it calls ""pseudo-science"".This organisation, and those who shared its message in French, cited a post from the ESA that it published to its website as well as on X and Facebook on July 13, 2023. Screenshot taken on Facebook on July 21, 2023 Many of the posts also featured a map, which Copernicus had posted on July 12 to go along with an article on the heatwave. What do ESA and Copernicus say?On July 12, Copernicus's website devoted its ""image of the day"" to the heatwave. It featured a map of Spain from the previous day showing the land surface temperature measured in Celsius. Several areas were in grey, indicating temperatures around 60 degrees Celsius. Screenshot taken on Copernicus website on July 23, 2023 Alongside the map was an article entitled ""Scorching heatwave hits Spain"".""On 11 July 2023, the Land Surface Temperature (LST) in some areas of Extremadura (Spain) exceeded 60Â°C, as highlighted in this data visualisation derived from measurements from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instrument,"" the article explained.""The ongoing heatwave in Spain this week is resulting in a total of 13 autonomous communities, being at extreme risk (red alert), significant risk (orange alert), and risk (yellow alert) due to maximum temperatures that, in some cases, will exceed 40Â°C and reach a maximum of 43Â°C,"" it added. A disclaimer at the end cautioned that ""the LST is the temperature of the soil and should not be confused with air temperature.""The following day, the ESA published its own article on the heatwave. The agency is in charge of a space component of the Copernicus programme and uses a constellation of satellites dubbed ""Sentinels"". One of them is equipped with a radiometer for measuring land surface temperature. In its article entitled ""Europe braces for sweltering July"", the ESA mentioned both air and land surface temperature. ""The highest temperature in European history was broken on 11 August 2021, when a temperature of 48.8Â°C was recorded in Floridia, an Italian town in the Sicilian province of Syracuse. That record may be broken again in the coming days,"" the ESA wrote.""In some cities the surface of the land exceeded 45Â°C, including Rome, Naples, Taranto and Foggia. Along the east slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily, many temperatures were recorded as over 50Â°C,"" it added. ""The heatwave is also hitting other cities across Europe with air temperatures expected to reach 44Â°C in parts of Spain later this week. A wider view of Europe can be seen in the image below. Land surface temperatures hit 46Â°C in Rome, Italy, while Madrid and Seville in Spain reached 46Â°C and 47Â°C, respectively.""The article went on to explain the difference between the two types of measurements: ""While weather forecasts use predicted air temperatures, this satellite instrument measures the real amount of energy radiating from Earth – and depicts the temperature of the land surface. Therefore, the map shows the actual temperature of the landâ€™s surface which is significantly hotter than air temperatures.""In an update added to the article on July 18, the ESA clarified once again: ""Land surface temperature is how hot the 'surface' of Earth feels to the touch. Air temperature, given in our daily weather forecasts, is a measure of how hot the air is above the ground.""While the articles mentioned both air and land surface temperature -- which could have confused some readers -- they made it clear that it was a matter of two different types of input instead of one measure having replaced the other. ""We haven't changed our method of recording temperatures,"" said Clement Albergel, a climate applications expert at ESA. In 2022, the agency had already published articles based on readings of land surface temperature, including here and here. What's more, ""the ESA does not have the authority to establish temperature records"", he told AFP on July 23, adding that ""land surface temperature data obtained from space aren't used to establish heat records approved by the WMO.""Criteria for temperature records The World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a specialised agency of the United Nations, is the ""recognised authority for verifying extreme weather records"", according to its website. It maintains a World Weather & Climate Extremes Archive, which includes extreme cases of temperature, rainfall, aridity, lightning and weather-related mortality. ""WMO is responsible for monitoring global and hemispheric temperature records -- and in some cases continental ones (as with Europe). We do this based on instruments at weather stations, NOT satellites,"" a WMO spokeswoman told AFP on July 25, 2023. ""For weather forecasts (and reporting of record temperatures), it's the air surface temperature which is used -- 2 meters,"" she added. The hottest month of JuneOn July 17, the WMO published an article explaining the long approval process for temperature records. ""WMO is currently verifying two temperature readings of 54.4Â°C (130Â°F), recorded at Death Valley, California, on 16 August 2020 and again on 9 July 2021. If validated, this would be the highest temperature on Earth since 1931 and third hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet,"" the article said. ""The investigations are meticulous and so take time. Findings are published in peer-reviewed journals. Both the 2020 and 2021 sensors in Death Valley have to be dismantled and shipped to an independent testing calibration laboratory. One of the testings has been completed and we are awaiting the second,"" it added. The WMO went on to say that in case of new records, ""we will issue a quick preliminary assessment and then start detailed evaluations as part of our painstaking verification process"".Contacted by AFP on July 25, 2023, a Copernicus spokesman confirmed that ""regarding the data provided by Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), the measurements have not been changed"". On its website, the climate service states that the temperatures that it uses are ""measured close to the Earth's surface, at a height of approximately 2 metres above the surface"". Why measure land surface temperature?In the aforementioned article, ESA explained that ""scientists monitor land surface temperature to better understand and forecast weather and climate patterns as well as monitor fires. These measurements are also particularly important for farmers optimising the irrigation of their crops and for urban planners looking to improve heat mitigating strategies.""Islands of freshness in ParisWithin a city like Paris, for example, some of the more urbanised areas are warmer than others. According to Albergel, ""with this satellite data, we can create urban heatmaps... and thereby intervene in a targeted way, by installing green spaces (trees or shade structures) or blue ones (fountains) that have a cooling effect on the most vulnerable zones."" He said that satellite observations can also make it possible to follow the effects of adaptation measures to climate change. ""Impact in terms of thermal comfort for residents, but also the economic impact: investment of a certain amount of euros enables us to improve the thermal comfort of this or that zone in Paris by reducing temperatures,"" he added.BÃ©nÃ©dicte REYAll articlesAFP FranceAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU proposes emergency plan for Lampedusa migratory flows,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited the Italian Island of Lampedusa and proposed an emergency plan to help Rome manage migratory flows. A list for Spain's proposal to make Catalan, Basque and Galician official EU languages inadvertently omitted Croatian. Twenty young European ambassadors from the Western Balkans clean the beaches of Lake Prespa in North Macedonia as part of the EU-funded ""EUBeachCleanup'' initiative. Migrants: Brussels proposes emergency plan for Italy, calls for European solidarityLampedusa (AFP) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen presented an emergency plan on Sunday on the small Italian island of Lampedusa to help Rome manage migratory flows. She also called on Italy's European partners to show solidarity.After visiting a reception centre for migrants with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, von der Leyen detailed a 10-point aid plan designed to manage the emergency situation, distribute asylum seekers more effectively between European countries, facilitate returns and prevent episodic mass arrivals.The plan is supposed to combine a firm stance against human traffickers with the facilitation of legal channels of entry into Europe for those eligible for asylum.""Irregular migration is a European challenge and it needs a European response, we are in this together"", von der Leyen stressed. ""We urge other Member States to use the Voluntary Solidarity Mechanism"", she said. French Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin announced on Monday that he would be travelling to Rome. (18 September)Croatian mistakenly omitted from list of official EU languages â€‹Brussels (HINA) – In its proposal to declare Catalan, Basque and Galician as official languages â€‹â€‹in the European Union, the Spanish Permanent Representation to the EU accidentally omitted the Croatian language from that list. The mistake will be corrected immediately, according to Spanish diplomatic sources.""We heard about the mistake, don't worry, it will be corrected,"" said the source when asked why there is no Croatian in the proposed list of official and working languages.Spain's government of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who is trying to form a new government after the parliamentary elections ended without a clear winner, has proposed that Catalan, Basque and Galician be declared official languages â€‹â€‹of the EU. It is a concession to the regional parties of Catalonia, the Basque Country and Galicia, in a bid to win their support for the formation of the government.The Spanish proposal is on the agenda of tomorrow's meeting of the General Affairs Council, which consists of the ministers for European affairs of the member states.The European Union has 24 official languages, and the last language that was accepted as official was Croatian in 2013, when Croatia became a member of the European Union.Changing the regulation on official languages â€‹â€‹requires the consent of all member states and the Spanish proposal has very little chance of being accepted. First of all, such a decision could create a domino effect so that other member states also start asking for the same status for their regional languages. Second of all: the high costs. For example, according to its spokesperson, the Commission alone spent around 300 million Euro last year on translation into all official languages.There is also the problem of a lack of translators and interpreters, especially for Basque and Galician, which have very few speakers. (18 September)The EU organises beach cleaning on Prespa Lake Skopje (MIA) - The Deputy Head of the EU Delegation in North Macedonia, Ben Knupnau, and the Mayor of Resen, Jovan Tozievski, launched the first ""EUBeachCleanup"" on Prespa Lake. The clean-up action is an annual global initiative and this year it will be organised on Slivnica beach through the EU-funded network of young European ambassadors ""We Balkans"". This year the shore of Prespa Lake will be cleaned by 20 young European ambassadors from the Western Balkans who will join their Macedonian peers to clean Slivnica beach. According to a statement from the EU Delegation in Skopje, this will encourage people to clean the beaches of Lake Prespa from the rubbish that bothers them. (17 September)Â Commission calls on Slovakia, Hungary and Poland to take a constructive approach to grain importsBrussels (TASR) – The European Commission (EC) on Sunday called on Poland, Hungary and Slovakia to take a constructive approach after the countries unilaterally extended a ban on Ukrainian grain imports despite the Commissionâ€™s decision to lift it.""We are aware of some Member States' announcements in respect to unilateral measures. What is important right now is that all countries work in the spirit of compromise and engage constructively,"" an EC spokeswoman said.Ukraine was one of the world's leading grain exporters, but Russia's military invasion in 2022 has reduced its ability to supply agricultural products to world markets through Black Sea ports. Since then, Ukrainian farmers have been reliant on grain exports through neighbouring countries.However, the flood of grain and oilseeds to neighbouring countries has affected the incomes of farmers there and led governments to ban imports of agricultural products from Ukraine.The EU intervened in May to prevent individual countries from acting unilaterally and imposed its own ban on imports from Ukraine to neighbouring countries. Under this ban, Ukraine could export through these countries on condition that the products were sold elsewhere.The EU did not extend the ban on Friday after Ukraine pledged to take measures to tighten export controls to neighbouring countries. In response, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary announced on Friday that they would maintain their own restrictions on grain imports from Ukraine despite the Commission's decision.The issue is particularly sensitive in Poland, which faces elections in October and where farmers are a key constituency of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.""Our focus now is to put in place and make work the new system just announced,"" a spokeswoman for the European Commission said, adding that Monday's meeting with representatives of all EU countries involved would provide an opportunity to discuss the issue further. (17 September)European Commission terminates the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism for Bulgaria and RomaniaBrussels/Sofia (BTA) – The European Commission has suspended the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM), which monitored judicial reforms, the fight against corruption and the fight against organised crime in Bulgaria and Romania. The Commission introduced the monitoring mechanism in 2007, preparing assessment reports and recommendations every six months at first and later once a year.In 2018, the Commission decided to stop issuing reports on Bulgaria due to sufficient implementation of recommendations, having issued 17 assessments by then. In July this year, the Commission announced that it intended to terminate the mechanism. From 2020, the Commission has introduced a common annual report on the state of the rule of law in each EU country.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Bulgaria and Romania on the significant progress made since their accession to the EU. â€œThe rule of law is one of our fundamental common values as a Union and both Member States have delivered on important reforms in these past years. Today we recognise these efforts by putting an end to the CVM,â€ said Von der Leyen.According to Bulgarian Vice President Iliana Iotova, the termination of the monitoring mechanism is undoubtedly one of the best news for Bulgaria. The efforts of many Bulgarian governments, politicians and MEPs for all these 17 years have been crowned with success, she said.Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said that with the decision of the European Commission another barrier to be on equal footing with the rest of the European Union had been removed. He added that Bulgaria must soon remove the others – to be accepted in Schengen and to join the Euro area, the Bulgarian prime minister said.Politicians in the Bulgarian parliament described the Commission's decision as a huge success, a recognition of reforms, but also a vote of confidence in advance.

Grainy days for the EU single-market as cereal import ban expired?,"The temporary import ban on Ukrainian grain for the countryâ€™s five EU neighbours ended on September 15. Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland â€“ parliamentary elections are due in the latter two in the upcoming weeks â€“ unilaterally extended their bans to the dismay of the EU. Ukraine consequently filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation.On September 15 the European Commission decided not to extend its ban on Ukrainian grain imports – specifically wheat, maize, sunflower and rapeseed – that applied to the countryâ€™s EU neighbours Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria.One day later, Poland, Hungary and Slovakia took matters into their own hands by issuing their own bans on the import of Ukrainian grain and other goods, citing the need to protect their farmers from competition due to significantly increased Ukrainian imports.Both Ukraine and the European Commission have called on the three to step back from the unilateral extension of the embargo. The Commission is analysing the measures taken by the three EU states, according to a spokeswoman.Kiev has since filed a complaint with the World Trade Organisation (WTO) against the three countries. Janusz Wojciechowski, the Polish EU Agricultural Commissioner, said he was ""quite surprised that Ukraine chose this route"" given that export volumes have risen sharply in recent months despite the restrictions.""For us, it is important in principle to prove that individual member states cannot impose an import ban on Ukrainian goods,"" said Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraineâ€™s first deputy prime minister and minister for economy in a statement. During a speech at the UN General Assembly, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the ""political theatre"" around grain imports would only help Moscow.â€œPart time solidarityâ€ doesnâ€™t make the cut, single-market-unity must prevailOn Monday, the blocâ€™s agricultural ministers met for the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council, where some showed dismay with the unilateral bans by Warsaw, Bratislava and Budapest while others understood their decisions.""I believe that it is, not only an error, but also contrary to Community law and, evidently, to the principles of the single market, for any Member State to adopt unilateral restrictive measures,"" declared Spanish Agricultural Minister Luis Planas who chaired the meeting. He pointed out that the EU-27 have defended the need to preserve unity in defence of Ukraine in regard to ""unilateral"" bans on grain imports and that they have called for measures to be taken ""with the consensus of all"".I also don't see how this can be brought into line with EU law. Cem Ã–zdemir, German Agriculture Minister Slovenian Agriculture Minister Irena Å inko also expressed concern about unilateral measures and seconded the importance of a united EU approach. German Agriculture Minister Cem Ã–zdemir criticised the move by the governments in Warsaw, Budapest and Bratislava as ""part-time solidarity"" with Ukraine. ""I also don't see how this can be brought into line with EU law,"" he added, saying his information showed that the market was handling Ukrainian grain well.While his Austrian counterpart Norbert Totschnig called on the EU to ensure the workings of the single market, emphasising solidarity with Ukraine, he also showed understanding for the neighbouring states. The infrastructure should be expanded so that Ukrainian grain gets to where it is needed more – for example in countries of the Middle East and Africa, said Totschnig.Ukraine's struggles to export foods has spurred global concerns over grain supplies. The EU has bolstered so-called Solidarity Lanes. Photo: Uncredited/AP/dpaSolidarity lanes, worry about global grain suppliesUkraine, a major grain producer, struggles to export the foods due to Russia's blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports which has spurred global concerns over grain supplies. This resulted in the EU becoming a major transit route and export destination for Ukrainian grain bound for Africa and the Middle East. In mid-July, Russia abandoned the Black Sea grain deal, which previously allowed Ukraine to export grain through the Black Sea ports and has upped attacks on Ukrainian export facilities.The EU has bolstered other so-called Solidarity Lanes, routes over land and along rivers that have been used to export over 44 million tonnes of grain from Ukraine following the Russian invasion.Croatiaâ€™s Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said that a clear message was sent to Ukraineâ€™s leadership stating that Croatia would like to be a transit country - and not a country flooded by cheap cereals which could cause trouble for local farmers. Earlier this month, Ukrainian office-holders confirmed that Ukrainian cereals were being dispatched via Croatia's ports on the River Danube and Adriatic seaports. â€œAlthough it is a niche trade route, it is already popular,â€ Yulia Svyrydenko said.Measures, protests, fear and grainInitially, the EU measure to temporarily ban imports was introduced in April and extended in June until mid-September. Faced with a slump in prices on local markets and angry European farmers, the ban was adopted in response to the logistical bottlenecks, and accumulations of wheat which had caused distortions in the market of the five Eastern European countries.According to the European Commission, these distortions have now ""disappeared"", making the temporary restrictions introduced previously ""no longer necessary"". The decision had been taken after Kiev agreed to introduce measures such as an export licensing system within 30 days to ""avoid grain surges"", the Commission said.Ukrainian Minister of Agrarian Policy and Food, Mykola Solskyi who spoke via video conference at the EU agri-meeting said: â€œWe believe that this action scheme will satisfy all parties. And that even those three countries that are currently opposing Ukrainian agricultural exports will also join the plan. Because we all have one goal, which is victory in this terrible war. And to this end, there must be mutual understanding and mutual support between us.""Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. Elections in Poland are scheduled for mid-October. Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP/dpaAfter the EU ban expired, Hungary immediately announced it was going to close its border to 24 Ukrainian products, up from four previously.Poland's populist right-wing government of the Law and Justice party (PiS) followed suit and extended an embargo on Ukrainian grain. The issue is particularly sensitive ahead of next month's elections as the current government has strong support in farming regions and has led to a spat between Warsaw and Kiev. ""I warn the Ukrainian authorities: if the conflict escalates, we will add other products to the ban on imports into Polish territory"", said Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. However, he assured that Poland – a key ally of Ukraine – will continue to help its neighbour, but ""not at the price of destabilising the Polish market"". After initial confusion over remarks made by the prime minister regarding weapon deliveries on Wednesday, a government spokesman said on Thursday that ""in connection with questions on arms deliveries, I would like to inform you that Poland only executes previously agreed deliveries of ammunition and armaments. Including those resulting from signed contracts with Ukraine.""Slovakia initially also announced it would be banning the import of four commodities, including wheat, until the end of the year.  ""Our position is that we will apply unilateral measures until the system of guarantees by Ukraine has been evaluated and there are guarantees that imports are under control,"" Slovak Agriculture Minister Jozef BÃ­reÅ¡ said. He further stated that the European Commission should have introduced a transition period to test the system to see if it was effective and whether it would prevent uncontrolled imports before the embargo was lifted.However, the minister pointed out that despite the new situation, support for Ukraine and the transit of its grain to world markets remains. On Thursday, Ukraine and Slovakia agreed to establish a licensing system for grain trade which allows the ban to be lifted as soon as the system is set up. On September 30, early parliamentary elections are scheduled to take place in Slovakia to elect members of the National Council.Processing plants import cheaper grains from Ukraine, while our costs have tripled since the start of the war.Yasen Nakov, farmer at a protest in BulgariaBulgaria stands out from its regional neighbours: many of its sunflower oil producers complained of a serious shortage of seeds and high prices since the start of the embargo. However, farmers in the country are unhappy with their government's decision to let the ban expire. ""Processing plants import cheaper grains from Ukraine, while our costs have tripled since the start of the war,"" farmer Yasen Nakov said at a protest. Farmersâ€™ organisations put out a list of five demands and on September 20 an agreement was reached whereby the government promised to ban the import of Ukrainian sunflower seeds until import quotas are agreed. The cabinet also agreed to introduce a licensing regime for the import of wheat, maize and rapeseed, to cut short the deadlines for payment of farm subsidies and reduce the administrative burden for farmers.In Romania, where the largest quantities of Ukrainian grain exports pass through, agricultural organisations have suspended protests for 30 days while Ukraine implements the measures agreed with Brussels in return for lifting the import ban. Agriculture Minister Florin Barbu has assured the farmers' associations that nothing will be imported from Ukraine during this 30-day period.Bucharest has agreed that grain import licences will only be given to Romanian farmers and processors. Without the necessary approvals, no grain can cross the border, the government has stressed. If these requirements are not adhered to, Romania would also take the unilateral step of banning imports from Ukraine, while farmers have vowed that they would respond ""with large-scale protests.""This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: European Commission proposes extension of glyphosate licence,"The European Commission proposes that EU countries extend the licence for the herbicide ingredient glyphosate by ten years. Skopje, the capital of North Macedonia, is named as a 2028 European Capital of Culture. German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier calls for a European solution to migration problems.European Commission wants to licence glyphosate for ten more yearsBrussels (Belga) – The European Commission is proposing EU countries to extend the licence of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the much-discussed herbicide Roundup, by ten years. On Friday, the proposal will be formally discussed by member states for the first time, with a vote to be held in October. The Belgian position has yet to be determined.Whether an active substance can be authorised on the market is decided at European level. Individual member states then decide on the authorisation of specific products – such as Roundup from chemical group Bayer. Due to uncertainty about the harmful effects of glyphosate on humans and the environment, a ban on the sale of the substance to and its use by private individuals has been in place in Belgium for several years. The ban applies to all synthetic herbicides.The current authorisation of glyphosate came into force in December 2017 and runs until December 15, 2023, after it was extended by one year late last year because the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) needed more time to analyse all available scientific studies and insights. The dossier comprises as many as 180,000 pages, accounting for 2,400 studies.As the analysis by EFSA and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) revealed no major concerns, the Commission is now proposing to extend the authorisation of glyphosate by 10 years – in other words, until 2033. That is twice as long as at the start of the current authorisation in 2017, therefore, but five years less than the maximum term of 15 years.If the use of glyphosate is to be authorised for a longer time, Member States will have to observe a number of conditions and restrictions when authorising products containing glyphosate, the Commission says in its draft regulation. For instance, they will have to explicitly (re)assess private use and take into account the possible indirect effects on biodiversity. In agricultural areas, a 'buffer zone' of 5 to 10 metres around land treated with glyphosate will have to be respected. Maximum concentrations must be set for five types of 'impurities'.The Commission's proposal now goes to the 27 EU Member States, which are expected to vote on it in October. Approval does not require unanimity, but a so-called qualified majority. If no majority is found in favour of the proposal, but no majority against either, the Commission will decide on the authorisation itself.The Belgian government has no position yet. The federal agriculture minister, David Clarinval, pointed out that the ""current scientific consensus at EU level (is) that (the) studies definitely do not give rise to any particular concerns regarding the safety of glyphosate"". The Green party sees this differently and, through Deputy Prime Minister Petra De Sutter, called for a total ban on glyphosate at European level. (20 September)Skopje named 2028 European Capital of CultureBrussels (MIA) – The capital of North Macedonia, Skopje, was designated as a 2028 European Capital of Culture, at an event in the House of European History in Brussels on Wednesday.The ceremony was attended by Culture Minister Bisera Kostadinovska-Stojchevska and Skopje Mayor Danela Arsovska, among others.â€œDesignating Skopje as a European Capital of Culture for 2028 means a great success for our country, especially considering the ambitions we have as a country striving for full EU membership,â€ Culture Minister Bisera Kostadinovska-Stojchevska told the Macedonian Information Agency (MIA) following the announcement of the 2028 European Capital of Culture. â€œSkopje is prepared to respond to the challenge. In fact, Skopje seems to have been created over the centuries for this challenge. Under the European and Macedonian flag, we will raise the creative energy so that it spreads across the entire continent,â€œ Kostadinovska-Stojchevska remarked. (20 September)Steinmeier: Migration problems cannot be solved without European rulesSyracuse (dpa) – German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called for a European solution to migration problems in Germany and many other countries. ""It cannot be done without common European rules,"" he said on Wednesday during a visit to Syracuse, Italy, where he met President Sergio Mattarella. The growing number of refugees arriving in Italy and also in Germany was bringing municipalities to the end of their capacity, Steinmeier pointed out. .""And that is why it is all the more necessary that the common European solution finally comes and takes effect,"" said the German President. On the one hand, he added, it was necessary to reduce the number of people arriving, but on the other hand, it was also necessary to combat human traffickers.In Germany, Steinmeier would like to see ""a more honest debateâ€œ, he said. ""I think we need a very reasonable debate about what means are possible."" He added that it should not be about labels. ""Nor should we, from a high moral pedestal, accuse some of misanthropy and others of a policy that opens floodgates,"" Steinmeier said. He said he noticed in conversations he was having that there was a lot of understanding that the numbers needed to be brought down. (20 September)Germany and France propose a multi-speed EU to accommodate more countriesBrussels (EFE) – Germany and France presented several proposals to the other EU Member States on Tuesday to prepare for an enlargement to more than 30 members from 2030, including the possibility of groups of countries moving at a faster pace or making the disbursement of EU funds more closely linked to respect for the rule of law.""It is not a question of whether the EU has to enlarge, it has to enlarge,"" Laurence Boone, the French Secretary of State for European Affairs, stressed in a press statement after presenting the report with the proposals to her EU counterparts at the EU's General Affairs Council.""We have to start preparing for enlargement now and undertake the necessary reforms in the EU"", said the German Deputy Minister for European Affairs and Climate, Anna LÃ¼hrmann, who noted that ""the general consensus is that we need to have this debateâ€œ. However, there were differences in the reception of the report by the individual countries, Boone acknowledged.The report places the rule of law at the heart of any reform or enlargement of the EU, which it proposes to further strengthen by reinforcing the conditionality of the disbursement of EU funds to be respected. It highlights the ""general use"" of qualified majority voting in areas that for now require unanimity or the reduction of the number of commissioners. (19 September)Commissioner Wojciechowski says Slovenia will receive funds from agricultural reserveBrussels (STA) – European Commissioner for Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski said in Brussels on Monday that Slovenia will receive funding from the EU agricultural reserve to tackle the consequences of flooding in agriculture. He said the Commission was also ready to consider an emergency measure that would be financed from this reserve.During the meeting of EU agriculture ministers, the commissioner noted that Slovenia had received  1.2 million Euro under this year's agricultural crisis reserve, which is far from enough to cover new needs. ""That is why the Commission is ready to consider an emergency measure financed from the agricultural reserve. This would provide Slovenia with additional funds,"" he said, without giving further details.Wojciechowski told the press after the meeting that the agricultural reserve from the next financial year would be available from October 15. ""We have not yet decided on the individual amounts, but I think there will be a clear political decision that Slovenia will also receive funds from the crisis reserve,"" he said.He also promised flexibility in allowing Slovenia to make any changes to its rural development programme and the Common Agricultural Policy strategic plan. If the Slovenian proposal is in line with the legislation, the Commission is ready to support it, the commissioner said.Slovenian Agriculture Minister Irena Å inko called for flexibility as she presented details of the flood damage to agriculture, forestry and fisheries to the commissioner at the meeting.She said the damage in agriculture amounts to 145 million Euro, with more than 2,700 farms being affected by the early August floods. In forestry mostly forest roads were damaged, with the repair works estimated to cost 50 million Euro. The damage caused by landslides in forests is estimated at 90.3 million Euro and the damage to forest stands amounts to 1.9 million Euro. Meanwhile, the damage caused to the fisheries sector is assessed at around 6 million Euro.In the debate, the minister also called for an in-depth discussion on the relevance of EU instruments in cases of emergency such as the devastating flooding in Slovenia. Several colleagues from other countries supported her view and expressed their solidarity with Slovenia. (19 September)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"No, the EU has not forced Spain to remove communist tributes","On September 19, 2019, the European Parliament adopted a resolution condemning manifestations of ""totalitarian ideologies, such as Nazism and Stalinism"" in the European Union. Since then, social media posts have cited the text to suggest Spain had been required to remove communist symbols and tributes from public spaces. The claim has been published more than 500 times since August 21, 2023. Yet, the European Parliament's press service told AFP that the resolution was not ""binding"". Instead, it is a ""political declaration"". The social media claim is thus false. Â ""The European Parliament condemns communism and Stalinism and requires the Spanish state to remove signs of gratitude, tributes and street names dedicated to its agents in Spain (Carrillo, Pasionaria, Negrin, Largo Caballero, International Brigades...),""reads the claim posted to social media. It alleges that the decision was taken ""today"" in Strasbourg -- the seat of the European Parliament -- and is of a ""compulsory"" nature.The claim was shared hundreds of times on Facebook (1, 2) and X (formerly Twiter) (1, 2). The same allegation had already circulated on social media in 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022.Screenshot taken on Facebook on September 4, 2023European remembranceThe claim was posted along with a link to the European Parliament's resolution on the importance of European remembrance for the future of Europe  (2019/2819(RSP)). The text was adopted by 535 votes to 66, with 52 abstentions, on September 19, 2019.The initiative was launched by five political groups represented in the European Parliament: the European People's Party, the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, Renew Europe, Greens/EFA and the European Conservatives and Reformists. The resolution ""calls on all member states of the EU to make a clear and principled assessment of the crimes and acts of aggression perpetrated by the totalitarian communist regimes and the Nazi regime."" In addition, it ""condemns all manifestations and propagation of totalitarian ideologies, such as Nazism and Stalinism"".The resolution also calls on all member states to commemorate August 23 as the European Day of Remembrance for the victims of totalitarian regimes and to condemn and counteract all forms of Holocaust denial. Under point 17, the European Parliament ""expresses concern at the continued use of symbols of totalitarian regimes in the public sphere and for commercial purposes."" It recalls that ""a number of European countries have banned the use of both Nazi and communist symbols"".AFP's fact-checking team found nothing in the resolution to indicate that countries like Spain would have to remove tokens of recognition to communist figures from public spaces. Nor did the team find anything to suggest EU members would be required to provide accounts of ""communist crimes"" at educational institutions and on television, as claimed on social media.We also did not find anything in the Spanish press from 2019 on the supposed mandatory aspect mentioned in the viral posts.The European Parliament's press service told AFP on September 4, 2023 that the resolution ""is a political declaration"", adding that ""it is not binding"". Member states are not obliged to obey its demands. The resolution was adopted 80 years after the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, which triggered World War II.The European Union has various kinds of legislation. On the one hand there are regulations, directives and decisions, which are binding and must be respected once approved. On the other hand, there are non-binding legal acts such as recommendations and opinions, which allow European institutions to make their views known and to suggest courses of action without imposing any legal obligation. This is the case when it comes to manifestations of totalitarian ideologies.At the time of this article's publication, Spain still had street names dedicated to communist leaders including Juana Dona in the Arganzuela district of Madrid and La Pasionaria in the Puerto de Sagunto locality of Valencia. AdriÃ  LABORDAAll articlesAFP EspaÃ±aAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

UN stumbles over climate crisis and conflict resolution,"The 78th session of the United Nations General Assembly is drawing to a close. Tackling the effects of climate change and resolving military conflicts in Europe and beyond have emerged as bottlenecks. On a positive note, EU countries have shown that they're making progress towards achieving the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.EU and world leaders gathered in New York for the 78th session of the UN General Assembly. Much of the focus during the gathering was on tackling the effects of climate change, conflict resolution and the implementation of the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).While the EU is pushing forward its climate ambitions, oil and gas companies have been slowing down their decarbonisation commitments – by paying out handsome dividends to shareholders and lobbying governments to reverse climate commitments. Asked whether to welcome them at the two-week talks in Dubai starting in late November, the UN's former climate chief, Christiana Figueres, said ""it should depend on whether they are there to help and to accelerate decarbonisation,"" or ""whether they are literally operating against those objectives.""Leaders also addressed the need for resolution of several military conflicts. For the EU and its member states, Russia's aggression against Ukraine and the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia over Nagorno-Karabakh were high on the agenda. The fact that Russia has veto power at the UNâ€™s Security Council has proved to be a major obstacle to resolution.While the UN appears to be falling short on climate change efforts and conflict resolution, EU countries demonstrated some positive progress with regard to the implementation of the SDGs.All eyes on climate change?UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told world leaders the climate crisis had ""opened the gates to hellâ€. Guterres had billed last weekâ€™s ""Climate Ambition Summit"" as a ""no-nonsense"" forum, making clear that only leaders who had made concrete plans to achieve net zero greenhouse emissions would be invited.The event is the biggest climate summit in New York since 2019, when Greta Thunberg stunned the world with her ""How Dare You"" speech before the UN. Anger has been building among climate activists, particularly younger people, who turned out in thousands recently for the ""March to End Fossil Fuels"" in New York.The summit happened just weeks ahead of the COP28 climate talks in the United Arab Emirates. The goals at that include tripling renewable energy by 2030, and ending the generation of fossil fuel energy that isn't ""abated"" by carbon capture technology by 2050.In his opening address, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres evoked 2023's ""horrendous heat"" and ""historic firesâ€ but stressed that ""we can still limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5 degreesâ€, referring to the target seen as needed to avoid long-term climate catastrophe. After receiving more than 100 applications to take part, the UN released a list of 41 speakers which did not include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, or India.""Humanity has opened the gates to hell.""Antonio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations""The European Union has set ambitious emission reduction goals for 2030. We want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent. And the good news is that we are already on track to overshoot this goal,â€ said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the Climate Summit on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. â€œBut similar ambition is needed by other major emitters to ensure that global emissions peak by 2025 and unabated fossil fuels are phased out well before 2050,"" she added.The talks were partly overshadowed by an announcement from Britain – also not present – that it was rolling back the so far agreed policies that would mean achieving its net zero goal. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced he was adopting a more ""pragmatic"" approach to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, including pushing back a ban on the sale of cars fully run on fossil fuels and easing energy efficiency targets for rental properties. The moves come as Sunak's Conservative Party is trailing in the polls behind the Labour opposition amid a cost-of-living crisis.A general view of the UN Security Council meeting on Ukraine. Photo: Michael Kappeler/dpaConflict resolution highlights global divisionsIn a high-profile appearance at the UN Security Council, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy lamented the powerlessness of the United Nations at preventing conflict and called for fundamental overhauls of the global body, as Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine is about to move into its 20th month.""Away with Russia's veto power."" Zelenskyy challenged Moscow as he opened the UN Security Council meeting devoted to the war in Ukraine on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. He also criticised the UN for not fulfilling its role and not resolving world conflicts. ""It is impossible to stop the war because all actions have the aggressor's veto,"" denounced the Ukrainian leader, for the first time since the invasion sitting in the same room with a Russian leader, Ambassador to the UN, Vasily A. Nebenzya.""It has been 19 months since a permanent member of the Security Council unleashed a war of aggression against its neighbouring country, violating the principles of the UN Charter and international law"", said Bulgaria's president Rumen Radev, addressing the UN General Assembly.""It has been 19 months since a permanent member of the Security Council unleashed a war of aggression against its neighbouring country, violating the principles of the UN Charter and international law.""Rumen Radev, President of BulgariaMore than 60 countries took part in the Security Council meeting. Zelenskyy called for an expansion of the Security Council with permanent seats for Africa, Asia and Germany. He then relaunched his 10-point peace plan, reiterating as a precondition Russia's withdrawal and the re-establishment of borders before the 2014 invasion of Crimea. Poland opposes Germany gaining a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak said. There are 193 UN member states in total. Five countries have permanent seats on the Security Council: the US, China, Russia, Britain and France, who can veto all decisions.Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan accused the international community of inaction following Azerbaijan's military operation to take control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, mainly inhabited by Armenians. Speaking at the United Nations General Debate in New York on Saturday, Mirzoyan called for a UN mission to ""monitor and assess the human rights, humanitarian and security situation on the groundâ€.Nagorno-Karabakh is in Azerbaijani territory, but the majority of residents are Armenian and control of the region has long been contested between the two ex-Soviet republics. Last Tuesday, the authoritarian-led Azerbaijan launched a military operation to seize the region. Only one day later, the defeated Karabakh Armenians surrendered.Photo: Michael Kappeler/dpa2030 SDGs moving closerOn a more positive note, several EU countries have demonstrated their commitment to achieving the 2030 SDGs and the progress they have made so far.The 193 member countries of the United Nations have adopted a declaration to reaffirm their commitment to the stalled Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). The text was adopted unanimously, the day before the start of the UN General Assembly's General Debate, which saw speeches by leaders from across the world.The 17 Sustainable Development Goals were adopted unanimously by world leaders in 2015, and they serve as guidelines for more global sustainability, equality and prosperity. The goals include eradication of poverty and hunger, improving health and well-being, quality education, gender equality, clean water, affordable and clean energy, decent work and economic growth.Spain is diligent in the race to achieve the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. It occupies 16th place in the classification drawn up in the 2023 Sustainable Development Report. Despite this, the authors of the classification warn that, for the moment, Spain has not managed to exceed any objective, but it is in the process of doing so, for example, in terms of gender equality, health and well-being, green energy, and cheap and sustainability of towns and cities.According to the report, Croatia ranks 12th of the 166 evaluated UN members. Croatian President Zoran MilanoviÄ‡ said that Croatia was making progress with regard to the green transition and that it planned to increase the share of renewables in electricity consumption to 73.6 percent by 2030.The President of Slovakia, Zuzana ÄŒaputovÃ¡, noted that international efforts in the field of meeting Sustainable Development Goals have been partially slowed down by crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, but this can't be used as an excuse. She stated that 85 percent of electricity in Slovakia is produced with zero emissions, and the country will use 5 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in the next seven years on decarbonising the economy and increasing the use of renewable energy sources.Romania has already achieved 62 percent of its national targets for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, President Klaus Iohannis said. He mentioned that Romania ""has made significant progress on the SDGs related to environmental protection and limiting climate change"", facilitated by strong regional partnerships and by the involvement of multilateral institutions.Despite this momentum, more needs to be done, as Slovenian President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar argued. She said it was disastrous that the goals were being implemented so slowly. She said things needed to be shifted up a gear if the world is to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, for example.This article is published weekly.

On media freedom in Europe: Press briefing with MEPs Sabine Verheyen and Christel Schaldemose,"A week ahead of the European Parliamentâ€™s plenary session in Strasbourg, the enr organised a press briefing with MEPs Sabine Verheyen and Christel Schaldemose about the European Media Freedom Act (MFA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA). The topic of discussion was how they complement each other to promote media freedom, democratic participation and curb disinformation. On September 26, the European Newsroom co-organised with the European Parliament a press briefing with MEPs Sabine Verheyen (EPP, Germany), rapporteur for the European Media Freedom Act, and Christel Schaldemose (S&D, Denmark), rapporteur for the Digital Services Act. The press briefing took place at the European Parliament. The Media Freedom Act is designed to defend the pluralism and independence of the media and the confidentiality of sources. Among other things, it should ensure greater transparency in the ownership of media companies. The media would  also have to disclose how much money they receive from state advertising.On the issue of media freedom in Europe, Verheyen said that ""we cannot close our eyes to the fact that media freedom is under serious threat in several EU Member States"". The European Commission presented its European law on media freedom in September 2022 in response to the deteriorating situation in EU countries such as Poland and Hungary. In addition, obstacles have also been identified in other countries, including Greece, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia, prompting the need to step up the protection of journalists in Europe.Another important part of the law concerns content moderation by so-called very large platforms. Referring to the Digital Services Act (DSA), for which Schaldemose is rapporteur. On the one hand, Schaldemose said, she wants to ensure that media that meet international standards of good journalism are free from content moderation by large online platforms. On the other hand, she added, she wants to make sure that there are no loopholes for media that do not meet these international standards to spread misinformation or disinformation to European citizens.Next week, the European Parliament will vote in plenary on the Media Freedom Act.Around 40 journalists attended the briefing in person and 120 journalists participated online.The briefing was live streamed and recorded and can be viewed here.https://twitter.com/EPCulture/status/1706642608368288181",1

"Metsola: “Every effort must be made” to reach an agreement on migration
","At a time when migration is high on the agenda and in the run-up to the European elections next year, the European Newsroom (enr) spoke to the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, on migration, the upcoming ballots and EU enlargement. ""Next week will be the 3rd of October, ten years since the Lampedusa tragedy when the Mediterranean Sea was called the largest cemetery in the world. And here we are yet again in a situation where we are"" the President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, recalled in an interview with the European Newsroom (enr), as the Italian island recently saw thousands of migrants arrive in a few days.Metsola hoped for a rapid breakthrough in discussions between member states on the reform of EU migration policy, believing that ""every effort must be made"" to reach an agreement.One of the key files of the pact on migration and asylum presented by the European Commission in September 2020, was blocked by disagreements between the EU countries. The files were about a system of compulsory solidarity between the bloc in the event of a massive influx of migrants at the borders of a member state.Hungary, Poland, Austria and the Czech Republic opposed it in July, while Germany, Slovakia and the Netherlands abstained, making it impossible to reach the majority required for adoption. Meanwhile, Germany intends to approve the controversial crisis regulation for the planned EU asylum reform despite ongoing concerns in the governing coalition.To put pressure on member states to reach an agreement, the European Parliament decided last week to pause negotiations on two other regulations in the migration package aimed at reinforcing external border security.""I am optimistic because I would not be able to explain to voters how, after a five-year legislature, we failed to find a solution to one of the best legislative proposals we have ever had on the table,"" Metsola stated to the enr.She added that one ""can't push towards only having the security pillar (of the reform) without the asylum pillar"", meaning the solidarity between member states. Metsola pointed out that the politically inflamed issue of migration was the top concern in 26 of the European Union's 28 member states in the 2019 elections. ""From citizens to refugees and from job seekers to prime ministers in the European Council, emotions run extremely high at all levels when you put the word migration on the table,"" she said.Belgium will take over the presidency of the European Council in the first half of 2024 and will conduct the negotiations with the parliament from January.'Italy cannot be left alone'News agencies from the European Newsroom in the European Parliament in Brussels on September 26, 2024. Photo: European Parliament - DaÃ¯na Le LardicRegarding the migratory pressure on Italy, Metsola said that a country that was faced with a massive arrival of migrants like it is happening right now, ""cannot feel left alone"". She was referring to Lampedusa which is ""an island of 6,000 citizensâ€œ that â€žsuddenly receives 1,700 people one day, another 3,000 anotherâ€œ.The president of the European Parliament said she was open to Italyâ€™s request to the possibility of a naval mission in the Mediterranean. ""This is something we could look at positively,"" she says, stressing that the mission would result in ""fewer people losing their lives"" and that ""borders are respected"".In addition, she also seemed to be in tune with Rome on another point – the EU-Tunisia understanding on migration, wanted by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, and which is currently facing rough waters. ""Until we have found a solution that allows for the processing of asylum claims outside the territory of the EU,"" she concluded, ""we will have to dialogue with those countries from which migrants have no other solution than to board a ship.â€Metsola stated that the European Union needed to find a solution according to which asylum requests can be processed outside the territory of the European Union, and until then a dialogue should be conducted with the countries from which migrants depart by boat.Schengen: Internal border checks ""worrying""Commenting on last week's border checks by Germany and Poland at the internal Schengen borders, she said that it was politically worrisome for her that there are extended internal border controls.Metsola added that if the necessary passenger checks were carried out at the external borders, there would be no need to re-establish the internal borders.""If you think about one of the most significant advantages of the EU and what people outside the EU look at when they think about the EU is freedom of movement. Freedom of movement means you can travel, work,"" she noted, saying that the internal borders in the EU are being closed because the policy of guarding the external border is not working well.She also said Bulgaria and Romania should be admitted to the Schengen area and a positive decision should be expected by the end of the Spanish Presidency of the EU Council. ""You have been not only expecting it but deserving it since 2011,"" she said.EU enlargement: Metsola hopes to see negotiation talks with Ukraine by the end of the yearThe President of the European Parliament hopes to see the EU open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova by the end of the year, calling for the hopes of these candidate countries not to be ""disappointed"".""If Ukraine and Moldova are ready, accession negotiations should be able to begin, and steps could then be taken gradually, step by step. Each country follows its own path, but let's not disappoint the millions of people who call Europe their home"", she urged.In June 2022, in a highly symbolic gesture, the EU granted Ukraine and Moldova candidate status. The European Commission is due to issue a report at the end of October on the progress made by all countries who want to join the EU, and it is expected in particular to recommend the European Council to open accession negotiations for Ukraine and Moldova.Five countries in the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia, Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia) also have candidate status. Some of them have been negotiating membership for more than ten years.Metsola also commented on the recent attacks in Kosovo and called all sides to make â€œgenuine efforts to restore calm and stabilityâ€.2024 European electionsEP President Roberta Metsola, European Parliament, September 26, 2023. Photo: European Parliament - DaÃ¯na Le LardicMetsola expects a tough campaign for the June 2024 European elections but also for the next EU to have a pro-European, constructive majority.The EP president said the fight against extremism will be a major challenge in the campaign for the June 6-9 elections. She said she expected the political groups in the next EP to be even more fragmented than now and that they would need more time to define their priorities. The political groups should do so before July 17, 2024, when the new EP will hold its inaugural session.According to her, it is necessary to combat the extremist groups' narrative, to understand that there are frustrated, marginalised citizens who have not voted for mainstream parties for years.""The answer is not from the establishment parties to look to their secure votes, but actually to look at those votes that they've lost and ask themselves why they did not talk enough to those people who are marginalised, who have no jobs, who are in rural areas, who feel abandoned or who are in urban areas, who feel unprotected,"" Metsola said.When asked about the main candidate system, according to which each political group should nominate one candidate for the President of the European Commission, and that the position automatically goes to the party that wins the most votes, she said that it worked in 2014. At the time Jean-Claude Juncker was elected President of the Commission as a candidate European People's Party. But the system was abandoned in 2019, when the European Council nominated Ursula von der Leyen, who did not even run.The European Council, which nominates a candidate, and the European Parliament, which votes on the candidate, must agree on that question before next year's elections, Metsola stressed.If von der Leyen wants to run for re-election, she added, she would have to participate in the campaign as president of the Commission, not as an MEP candidate in her constituency.Metsola said von der Leyen has done a very good job, although she has not had an easy term, and that one should welcome the fact that she is the first woman at the helm of the Commission.This article is published weekly.

","European Commissioner OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi has announced a new plan for economic growth in the Western Balkans. Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel will travel to Washington to discuss issues including import tariffs, climate change and Russia's war on Ukraine. The European Commission says there have been fewer illegal crossings at the Austrian-Slovenian border.VÃ¡rhelyi: New plan for accelerating economic growth in the Western BalkansBrussels (ATA) – European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi said that a new plan to accelerate economic growth in the Western Balkans was being prepared. He emphasised that the economic investment plan, worth 30 billion euros, was the backbone of the connectivity and integration plan.In the current geopolitical context, EU enlargement to the Western Balkans was more than ever â€œan investment in peace, security and prosperity on our continent,"" VÃ¡rhelyi said. ""We are helping to diversify the energy mix and decarbonise Western Balkans economies, shift towards more sustainable transport systems, crowd in private sector support and move towards a greener and more digitally developed region,"" he added.â€œWe have so far approved some 4.3 billion euros in grants, which will mobilise 15.9 billion euros in overall investments. This includes funding for 54 flagship projects in transport, energy, environment, digital transition, human capital and private sector competitiveness,"" VÃ¡rhelyi emphasised.French Delegate Minister for Foreign Trade Olivier Becht said that the main objective continued to be the acceleration of relations between the countries of the Western Balkans and the common market of the European Union. (28 September)Von der Leyen and Michel travel to Washington on 20 OctoberBrussels (Belga) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel will travel to Washington on 20 October for consultations with US President Joe Biden, announced a European official.The EU-US summit would aim to ""strengthen our strategic partnership"" and discuss how to tackle ""common challenges"" such as climate change and the state of the global economy, the anonymous source explained.European and US leaders will also discuss the customs duties on European steel imports that former President Donald Trump introduced in 2018. Those tariffs have been partially suspended, pending a broader agreement which must be concluded by the end of October. If not, the higher customs duties will come back into full effect. According to the official, the two sides have already had ""very good talks"" on the issue.In addition, Biden, Michel and von der Leyen are expected to reiterate their support for Ukraine in Washington and exchange views on possible new sanctions against Russia. This will include issues surrounding the enforcement of sanctions and cooperation with third countries through which Russia is trying to circumvent sanctions.According to the official, the trade in Russian diamonds is also on the agenda. The G7 has been discussing for some time how to curb the trade, worth 4-5 billion dollars a year, through a diamond tracking system. (27 September)EU: Fewer illegal crossings at the Austrian-Slovenian borderBrussels (APA) – According to the European Commission, the situation at the Austrian-Slovenian border has ""improved"", following the introduction of temporary border controls. A Commission spokeswoman confirmed in Brussels on Tuesday that the number of illegal border crossings had fallen. However, the Commission maintains its position that internal border controls should only be used in exceptional cases and should be limited in time.The Commission also reacted to German plans, which became known on Monday: German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser had announced stationary border controls at the Polish and Czech borders to prevent illegal entries into German territory. The spokeswoman stressed that the Commission was in close contact with the member states that had notified Brussels of the controls. She also stressed that the Slovenian and Austrian authorities would cooperate more closely, which the Commission welcomed.Borders between Schengen members are not controlled as such. However, it is possible to introduce exceptional controls for a limited period of time and for justified reasons. For example, France controls its border with Italy because of the threat of terrorism and illegal immigration. Austria controls its borders with Hungary and Slovenia because of migratory pressure on the EU's external borders. The exceptional controls have to be newly approved every six months. (26 September)European Public Prosecutor's Office announces an investigation in Bulgaria related to agricultural fraudBrussels/Luxembourg (BTA) – The European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) has announced that under its authority, officers from the Directorate General for Combating Organised Crime (DGCOC) have detained three people and searched six locations in an investigation into an organised crime group that illegally received European Union agricultural funds.On the basis of the investigative actions carried out by the DGCOC and the Bulgarian State Agency for National Security, as well as the evidence and documents seized, it was concluded that the suspects had provided false information on behalf of others to obtain EU funding. According to the clues, instead of applying for funds for a large plot of land, the suspects divided the area and used people of ""low socio-economic statusâ€ as proxies to apply for agricultural benefits, a press release said.The suspected leader of the organised crime group was authorised by the front men to act as their representative to the State Agriculture Fund and banks. He was thus able to obtain EU funds and full control over the projects.Two employees from the State Agriculture Fund and the regional agricultural office in Sevlievo are suspected of complicity. They may have facilitated the activities of the criminal group by providing information and advice on the relevant operational programme and project implementation checks. It is stated that a civil servant is among those arrested. The total amount of damage has yet to be established, the press release added.

Posts falsely claim Ireland sent extradition notices to Ukrainians,"Several member countries of the European Union, led by Poland and Germany, have welcomed thousands of Ukrainian refugees after Russia's attack on their country launched on February 22, 2022. More than 84,000 Ukrainian citizens have arrived in Ireland. Against that background, social media users claimed that the Irish government had -- at Kyiv's request -- sent extradition notices to Ukrainian nationals living on its territory. The posts were shared in several languages and included a photo of the alleged letter, which claimed that the Ukrainians had evaded military service. Yet Ireland is a signatory to a European convention which does not allow for such extraditions. The letter shared on social media is fake. Ireland's justice department told AFP it had sent no such letter and experts in European law said its contents lacked legal credibility.According to official Irish statistics published on June 13, 2023, 78% of 84,600 arrivals are women and children, but the remaining 22%, or around seventeen thousand, are men.Ukraine has been battling Russian troops in a slow-moving counter-offensive that it launched in June, more than a year after Russia invaded. The counter-offensive has seen Ukraine's army come up against powerful Russian defensive lines involving trenches, minefields, and tank traps. ""They have started sending extradition notices to Ukrainians,"" reads a claim repeatedly posted to X (formerly Twitter) and Facebook (here, here and here) since September 10, 2023. Published alongside is a photo of the alleged document.The letter, dated September 7, is addressed to a certain ""Mr Ihor Doroshenko"" and features the department of justice in its header. It reads: ""We are writing to inform you that the Department of Justice has received a request from the Government of Ukraine for your extradition.""Screenshot taken on Facebook on September 14, 2023Similar posts were shared on social media in various other languages including English, Polish and Czech. Most of the posts were shared by accounts that are openly pro-Russian.At the start of Russia's invasion, the Ukrainian army was bolstered by an influx of volunteers wanting to fight for the cause, but now a year and a half later, after suffering losses, the country has been forced to rely more on conscription, according to AFP.With that in mind, Ukrainian authorities have taken a tough stance towards those looking to avoid going to war. In late July, a senior former military official was detained for suspected corruption. Investigators accused Yevgen Borisov of accepting bribes in return for exempting some people from being mobilised in the army.â€˜Fraudulentâ€™ Yet, the document that we are verifying here, which appears to show that the country sent extradition notices to its nationals in Ireland, is fake. Contacted by AFP on September 13, Ireland's department of justice said it had never sent anything of the sort, calling the document ""fraudulent"". The department also warned residents of Ireland about it in a press release.""If anyone is unsure of the authenticity of any correspondence they receive purporting to be from the Department of Justice, they can contact the Department on 1800 221 227,"" the department said.""Scams are common. They can happen at any time. Some of the most common types of scams involve the use of fake emails, calls or texts pretending to be from real companies and organisations. We urge people to be extremely cautious and to not engage or share any personal information,"" it added. Military offences excluded from extradition conventionAFP also spoke with two experts in EU law who pointed out that the letter shared on social media lacked legal credibility. The fake document claims that Ukrainian nationals in Ireland can be subject to an extradition request for failing ""to comply with your legal obligation to serve in the armed forces"". Men of conscription age have been banned from leaving Ukraine since February 2022, when the president ordered a full military mobilisation in response to Russia's invasion.To support its claim, the letter makes reference to two legal documents: Ireland's 1965 Extradition Act and the European Convention on Extradition from 1957.Both documents are real. The first is a reference framework for extradition issues in Ireland, while the other concerns all member states of the Council of Europe (not to be confused with the European Union). According to its website, the institution's mission is ""to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law across Europe and beyond"". The Council of Europe has 46 members states, including all 27 EU nations.These documents, however, ""do not provide for an extradition request on the grounds of such things as desertion or a refusal to take part in compulsory military service,"" according to Araceli Turmo, an associate professor in EU law at Nantes University.""Under the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, a person cannot be extradited for offences of a purely military nature,"" she told AFP on September 13.""If a soldier commits murder and there's an extradition request, the fact that he's military does not protect him. However, if he commits an offence that only exists under military law, this convention cannot be used to formulate an extradition request,"" she added.Carolyn Moser, a visiting professor at Sciences Po, recalled that the convention ""stipulates under article 4 that extraditions for military offences are excluded from its scope of application"".Screenshot of Article 4 of the 1957 European Convention on Extradition, taken on September 14, 2023  ""If Ukraine did indeed want a Council of Europe country to send back its nationals, it would have to base its request on a criminal offence,"" the expert in EU law told AFP on September 14.The same goes for Irish law. Article 4 of the Extradition Act of 1965 stipulates that ""extradition shall not be granted for offences under military law which are not offences under ordinary criminal law"".Screenshot of  section A of the Irish Extradition Act Outside of this legal framework, could a bilateral accord provide for the extradition of Ukrainian nationals to Ukraine? Not really, according to Moser: ""If there is a framework convention, you cannot conclude a bilateral agreement which provides for the contrary. Otherwise, you would have two conventions that contradict one another.""Extradition for a criminal offence?Ukrainian officials themselves have weighed in on the extradition issue. Davyd Arakhamia, leader of the parliamentary faction of the president's party, said in September that Ukrainian men of military age who left Ukraine illegally could be extradited back to their homeland. ""Ukraine is apparently considering asking other countries to extradite men who are still of military age,"" said Moser, adding however that it would be ""on the basis of criminal offences"" and not because they must respect conscription, as the fake letter claims.Despite Ukraine's full military mobilisation, many men of military age have still managed to leave the country. ""But to cross the border, they had to prove that they were exempted from military service. So some may have shown forged documents or certificates. If Ukraine ever wanted to submit an extradition request, it would be on this basis, namely a corruption offence or the falsification of documents,"" Moser said. But even if Ukraine were to go for it, it ""would have to gather a sufficient amount of evidence to show that the wanted person had committed an offence or even a crime,"" she added. ""For example, it would have to show that the person bribed a border official or bribed a doctor for a forged certificate, etc. The offence would also have to be punishable in Ireland: reciprocity is generally a prerequisite for extradition.""""Ukraine would then have to make a formal request for every wanted person, supported by a dossier of evidence. The Irish authorities could then launch into action,"" Moser added. Turmo pointed out yet another nuance. ""Under no circumstances are collective extraditions authorised in the European Convention on Extradition. It has to be a specific person for an act that he or she committed. It is not possible to request the extradition of an entire group,"" she said. The question of whether to extradite Ukrainian men of military age ""also has an important political dimension"", Moser said. ""The courts must take it up but the final decision to extradite or not is taken by the justice ministry which, for political reasons, may not give the go ahead. However, that would have diplomatic implications,"" she added.  Emilie BERAUDAll articlesAFP FranceAll articlesTranslated by Anna Maria JAKUBEKWar in UkraineFacebook Twitter EmailEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

"Europe in brief: Sinkevičius questions Slovenian voluntary Natura 2000 measures
","European Commissioner for the Environment Virginijus SinkeviÄius criticised Slovenia's voluntary measures to meet EU Natura 2000 targets. Thousands of Armenians demonstrated in Brussels on Sunday following the Azerbaijani military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh. Croatia supports Bosnia and Herzegovinaâ€™s entry into the EU and NATO.EU environment commissioner fears voluntary Natura 2000 measures will not cut itBrussels (STA) - EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus SinkeviÄius, ahead of a visit to Slovenia, has expressed doubts about the workability of the government's decision to make binding Natura 2000 protection measures voluntary in some areas, following protests by farmers earlier this year. However, SinkeviÄius indicated that the Commission would remain on the sidelines for the time being.SinkeviÄius, who will visit next Tuesday to discuss a wide range of issues, pointed out that 38 percent of Slovenia's territory is covered by this network of protected areas, "" which is an impressive number and only shows how rich Slovenia is with the large number of habitats to be protected"".He added, however, that even in these areas ""ecosystems are unfortunately not doing well"" and that past experience suggests that optional measures do not produce the desired results.""I'm afraid that might be the case this time as well,"" said the Commissioner, who also discussed the situation with Agriculture Minister Irena Å inko and Natural Resources and Spatial Planning Minister UroÅ¡ BreÅ¾an a few months ago.SinkeviÄius explained that the viability of the voluntary measures can only be avaluated in Brussels once the results are in, but he reiterated that he had already warned the Slovenian authorities that ""this may not be enough"".In his view, a better solution would be to compensate farmers, as originally proposed by the government. This would ensure full compliance with EU legislation, the Commissioner stressed. (2 October)Joint statement by Fajon, Schallenberg and Radman: Unfinished EU integration of the Western Balkans is a geostrategic imperativeSkopje (MIA) – The heads of diplomacy of Slovenia, Austria and Croatia, Tanja Fajon, Alexander Schallenberg and Gordan Radman GrliÄ‡, have released a joint statement titled ""The unfinished EU: integrating the Western Balkans as a geostrategic imperative"" in which they say that â€œthe current situation is an opportunity for both the European Union and the Western Balkans to show more strategic foresight, to fully regain their enlargement credibility and to reinforce mutual trust, some of which had been lost over the years.â€â€œNegotiations with Albania and North Macedonia should advance. In North Macedonia, next steps depend on the country's ability to pass the required constitutional changes,â€ the statement says.â€œThe latter case is a reminder that EU member states and Western Balkan countries need to play a responsible role and refrain from inserting bilateral problems and disputes, which are unrelated with the accession process,â€ the statement adds. (2 October) Protestors carry placards and wave Armenian flags during a demonstration in support of Armenians in Brussels on October 1, 2023. Azerbaijan denied accusations of ethnic cleansing to clear the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh of its ethnic Armenian population, and told AFP its inhabitants were free to stay or go. Photo: Simon Wohlfahrt / AFPKarabakh: Armenian demonstration in Brussels against Europe's ""complicity""Brussels (AFP) – Thousands of Armenians converged in Brussels on Sunday to denounce ""European leadersâ€™ complicity"" in the Azerbaijani military operation in Nagorno-Karabakh, an enclave now virtually devoid of Armenian inhabitants.European leaders are ""criminals against the Armenian people, they spill the blood of the Armenian people,"" said Talline Tachdian, one of the organisers of the demonstration. The demonstrators made an emotional attack on the European Union, which they felt was guilty of ignoring the tragedy of the Armenians in exchange for the Azerbaijani gas that the EU buys to partially compensate for the loss of Russian gas.On Friday, the European Union called for a United Nations mission to go to Nagorno-Karabakh ""in the next few days."" According to a European Commission spokesman, it is ""urgent to ensure continuous unimpeded humanitarian support to those who are still in need in Karabakh, as well as to those who have left."" (1 October)German Foreign Minister campaigns for Ukraine to join the EU after warMunich (dpa) – In view of Russiaâ€™s war of aggression, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock has again called for Ukraine to join the European Union. It was Germany's task ""when this terrible war is finally over, that Ukraine can also join the European Union,"" Baerbock said on Sunday at an election campaign event of the Bavarian Greens in Munich. According to her, it is up to Germany to continue building the EU. (1 October)Croatia strongly supports integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and its entry into EU and NATOSARAJEVO (FENA) – After talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina's Defence Minister Zukan Helez, Croatian Defence Minister Mario BanoÅ¾iÄ‡ said in Sarajevo that Croatia strongly supports the integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina.He said that he is pleased with the positive developments that enable the efficient operation of the Ministry of Defence and the Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina (OSBiH), including the adoption of pro-European acts and the defence budget as well as commitment to reform processes.â€œIn this context, the Republic of Croatia recognizes the importance of NATO and the European Union (EU), instruments that can strengthen the capacities of the Armed Forces of BiH,â€ said BanoÅ¾iÄ‡.He emphasised that his country had so far supported all measures within NATO and EU initiatives that could help the development of BiH's defence capabilities and increase resilience, especially in dealing with hybrid challenges, but also the overall state of security in BiH.At the same time, BanoÅ¾iÄ‡ welcomed the rapid implementation of the joint conclusions of the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina related to the defence sector.Helez assessed the Republic of Croatia as an important foreign policy ally of Bosnia and Herzegovina, stressing that he was particularly pleased with BanoÅ¾iÄ‡'s statement that Croatia does not support any form of secession, i.e., that it strongly supports the integrity, territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina.â€œI want to emphasise that Croatia is the leader of the EU and NATO countries when it comes to Euro-Atlantic integration,â€ emphasised Helez, noting that during the conversation it was clearly stated that Croatia supports Bosnia and Herzegovina's entry into the EU and NATO.

Europe in brief: Breakthrough in migration debate,"First Germany blocked, then Italy. Now, after weeks of wrangling, the member states have agreed on new rules on migration. Also: Roberta Metsola wants Western Balkans to belong to the EU. European Political Community meets in Granada, Spain.EU member states reach breakthrough in dispute over asylum reformBrussels (dpa) – The EU member states have reached a breakthrough after weeks of dispute about a core element of the planned asylum reform. As the Spanish EU presidency announced on the X platform on Wednesday, a joint position was found on the proposals of the EU Commission on the controversial crisis regulation. The German government claimed part of the success at the compromise for itself, although there had been no progress on the plans for a long time due to German concerns.The crisis regulation could, for example, be used to extend the period during which people can be held in detention-like conditions in the event of a particularly sharp increase in migration. In addition, the group of people eligible for the planned strict border procedures could be enlarged. In general, the plans for the reform of the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum include numerous additions and tightenings to limit unwanted migration.With regard to the crisis regulation, the Greens within the German government in particular had humanitarian concerns. They feared that protection standards for refugees could be lowered too much. After pressure from partner countries increased, Berlin gave up its resistance last week. According to German government sources, Chancellor Olaf Scholz had informally exercised his authority to issue directives and ordered that opposition to the crisis regulation be abandoned. After the agreement on Wednesday, Scholz spoke of a ""historic turning point"".Last week, it initially looked like there would be movement in the dispute over the crisis regulation, but Italy objected because of the role of private sea rescue organizations in the Mediterranean. However, Rome now also agreed to the compromise in the Committee of Permanent Representatives of the Member States. According to diplomats, the right-wing government of Giorgia Meloni pushed to delete a phrase that was supposed to prohibit the use of crisis measures after the arrival of many migrants through sea rescue operations.Hungary and Poland voted against the draft crisis regulation, saying the proposals were not strict enough for them. However, the necessary majority was still reached. Austria, the Czech Republic and Slovakia abstained.Even though there were only minor concessions to Germany, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock hailed the agreement as a success. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser explained that important changes had been implemented on Germany's initiative. In the end, however, Germany was only able to push through few changes to the original proposal. This is considered bitter for the Greens in particular, because they once again had to support decisions that they did not want to accept initially.Following the agreement at the level of the member states, an understanding on the reform with the European Parliament is to be reached as quickly as possible now. Time is short: projects that have not been negotiated with the member states by the time of the European elections in June 2024 could subsequently be called into question again and be delayed for a long time. In the case of the planned reform of the asylum system, this would be a particularly major setback. Work on the project has been ongoing for years. Right-wing parties such as the AfD in particular have long accused the EU of failing in the fight against irregular migration. (October 4)Metsola: The European Union is not complete without the Western BalkansBrussels (FENA) – The European future of the Western Balkans was an essential geostrategic investment in a stable, strong and reunited Europe based on common values, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said in a statement.She believes that the European Union is not complete without the Western Balkans and that enlargement is the most powerful geopolitical tool for the European Union. Metsola stated that enlargement was a strategic, long-term geopolitical investment in Europeâ€™s peace, security, stability and prosperity, as well as a win-win situation.â€œThe transformative effect of enlargement is undeniable. The potential of EU membership provides a significant impetus for the changes that are necessary to improve governance, strengthen the rule of law, promote media freedom and create an appropriate climate for the flourishing of civil society,â€ Metsola said.She emphasized that the war in Ukraine had the side effect of accelerating the enlargement process, and she did not agree with opinions that there was no clear political will of the European Union to expand to the Western Balkans.â€œI do not agree that there is a lack of political will. This is a process, and candidacy depends on the countryâ€™s reform progress. We look forward to the European Commissionâ€™s presentation of the October enlargement package. However, the position of the European Parliament is clear – if the prerequisites are met, negotiations on EU membership should begin,â€ Metsola stated.Speaking about the security challenges in the Western Balkan countries, and considering the constant political turmoil, Metsola said that what was happening in the Balkans affected the entire continent.â€œThe first and most important priority is de-escalation and stabilization of security in the area. There are two recent events of concern, namely the attack on September 24 and the discovery of a huge weapons depot in northern Kosovo. We have also noticed the accumulation of the Serbian army at the administrative border, which is worrying and must be stopped immediately,â€ she said.As Metsola emphasizes, there is no place on the European continent for the accumulation of weapons and security forces.â€œThe efforts of the European Union are aimed at all actors, on both sides, to contribute to the de-escalation of the crisis. The dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina is important and the EU is very active in it,â€ she concluded. (October 5)With migration in the background, the EU reflects on its future at Granada meetingBrussels (EFE) – The heads of state and government of the EU are meeting in the Spanish city of Granada this Thursday to reflect on the future of the bloc. On Friday, there will also be meetings with other countries. Discussion on a potential expansion of the participants to the forum will be on the agenda. By request of the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, migration will also be discussed at the meeting.The countries aim to discuss how to face geostrategic challenges, both current and in the coming decades. They will discuss those issues with partners from the European Political Community, such as Ukraine, the United Kingdom, Turkey and the Western Balkans.After its inaugural meeting in Prague (Czech Republic) and the second in Chisinau (Moldova), the forum, which aims to emphasize the isolation of Vladimir Putin's Russia, especially after its aggression against Ukraine, will hold its third meeting in Granada, bringing together 51 delegations.

European Parliament moves to bolster media freedom,"The European Parliament has approved proposals for an EU media freedom law aimed at protecting reporters from political interference, allowing them to keep sources secret and ensuring media pluralism across the bloc. At the same time, obstacles to media freedom are becoming increasingly apparent across the continent.The European Parliament has backed a law designed to defend the pluralism and independence of the media and the confidentiality of sources. The so-called Media Freedom Act, among other things, should ensure greater transparency in the ownership of media companies. The media will also have to disclose how much money they receive from state advertising.â€œMany thought this was mission impossible. But we have it: a proposal to protect media freedom in the European Unionâ€œ, the Vice-President of the European Commission, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, said in Strasbourg.Sabine Verheyen, the German MEP in charge of the law in Parliament, said that â€œwe cannot close our eyes to the fact that media freedom is under serious threat in several EU Member States"". According to a parliamentary statement, MEPs want to ""ban any interference in the editorial decisions of media companies.""Slovenian MEP Irena Joveva warned that ""non-transparent takeovers of media companies for vested interests are taking place, and the public media, a pillar of credible information for the people, are in many places subject to attempts at subjugation, to say the least.â€œOpposition to the act came from parties such as Austriaâ€™s right-wing Freedom Party. Austrian MEP Harald Vilimsky is fundamentally opposed to the Media Freedom Act and sees it as a threat to press freedom. He also says the EU is overstepping its competences: ""These issues have been sufficiently regulated by law in the member states for a long time, there is no reason for a central office in Brussels to get involved here now.â€The German Association of Digital Publishers and Newspaper Publishers (BDZV) and the Media Association of the Free Press (MVFP) see improvements in the Parliament's position, but essential problems remain. For example, the agreed text stopped short of pushing for a blanket ban on governments spying on reporters.https://twitter.com/VeraJourova/status/1709178908355047472Trouble spotsThe European Commission presented its European law on media freedom in September 2022 in response to the deteriorating situation in EU countries such as Poland and Hungary. In addition, obstacles have also been identified in other countries, including Greece, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and North Macedonia, prompting the need to step up the protection of journalists in Europe.In September, eight European and international media organisations called on the Greek government to combat impunity for crimes against journalists and uphold press freedom. Although the Greek authorities claim press freedom is respected and Athens supports EU positions on open journalism, the conservative government of Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis has ""done little to remedy the problems"", the coalition said. In Romania, journalists face threats to their physical security, intrusion into their private lives and editorial pressure, said Liana Ganea, president of ActiveWatch, an organisation that promotes freedom of expression. Moreover, there is a lack of transparency of ownership and financing of media institutions by political parties and public authorities, a lack of labelling of political advertising.Politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina often attack journalists and influence public media or regulatory bodies. Journalists generally work in an environment without censorship, but many factors encourage self-censorship. While the country is trying to join the European Union, authorities in Republika Srpska (RS) are passing laws that contradict European standards. The law criminalising defamation, for example, came into force in the RS in August, despite comments and protests from the journalist community, NGOs and international organisations.In the 2023 World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), North Macedonia ranks 38th out of 180 countries, up 19 places from its 2022 ranking. RSF said that journalists in North Macedonia do not work in a hostile environment. Yet, widespread misinformation and a lack of professionalism contribute to society's declining trust in the media. That exposes independent outlets to threats and attacks.According to a 2018 analysis by the Investigative Reporting Lab Macedonia (IRL), Hungarians with ties to the country's pro-government media have begun a mass takeover of Macedonian news outlets, in a concerted push into the Balkans by media companies loyal to Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Two former executives of Hungarian public broadcaster Magyar TelevÃ­ziÃ³ (MTV), Peter Schatz and Agnes Adamik, have set up companies in North Macedonia that have acquired controlling stakes in pro-opposition media outlets in the country.Kyriakos Mitsotakis, Prime Minister of Greece, speaks during a press conference. Photo: Soeren Stache/Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH/dpaNo victory over espionageThe delegation visiting Greece in September found that ""Greek journalism is under sustained threat from the impact of the surveillance scandal"" that broke in 2022. The Pegasus spyware scandal involved the wiretapping of opposition politicians. Amongst them were the leader of the social democratic party PASOK, Nikos Androulakis, as well as journalists, business leaders, members of the government and close associates of Kyriakos Mitsotakis. This scandal, combined with the unsolved murder of a veteran journalist in Athens in 2021, abusive legal procedures and economic and political pressure, have threatened media freedom, the report says.Spyware has long been a hot topic in the European Parliament, which has dedicated a special committee to the use of programmes such as Pegasus and its successors. They played a part in the spying scandals that have hit the Spanish, Hungarian and Greek governments and are also investigative tools for the revelations that led to the explosion of the Qatargate corruption scandal.Media activists have criticised EU states, notably France, for pushing to expand loopholes allowing authorities to spy on journalists in the name of ""national security"". The Parliament's position limits the use of spyware as a ""last resort"" when journalists were involved in serious crimes such as terrorism or human trafficking. Also, a judge must give clearance. The decision not to approve a total ban has provoked criticism, including from Italyâ€™s Five Star Movement MEP Sabrina Pignedoli, who denounces how ""thanks to this amendment, the judicial authorities will be able to implant and hide malware on journalists' mobile phones or computers, in order to detect and even steal personal informationâ€œ.The issue has come to the fore in France following an uproar over the two-day detention of Ariane Lavrilleux last month. The French journalist, who works for the investigative website Disclose, was held in police custody for 39 hours on 19 and 20 September and had her home searched as part of a judicial inquiry into the compromise of national defence secrets. This came about after she had published articles about French arms sales abroad and a French intelligence mission in Egypt that the country allegedly misused to target and kill opponents.An illustration picture shows the logos of Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft displayed on a mobile phone with an EU flag displayed in the background. (Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS / AFP)A grey area for content moderation?Another important part of the law concerns content moderation by very large platforms. To prevent them from too easily removing articles or reports or restricting access to them, it says that media should, for example, demonstrate transparency about their ownership structure. Media should be editorially independent, monitored by a national regulator or should respect self-regulatory standards. AI-produced content should not be published without first undergoing human scrutiny.If an online platform considers that content published by a medium meeting these conditions nevertheless violates its terms of use and that the relevant content should be removed, the medium should be notified in advance and given 24 hours to respond. To avoid handing too much power to the internet giants, the law envisions setting tougher conditions for removing or restricting reports by media outlets, the so-called â€œmedia exemptionâ€.""On the one hand, we really wanted to allow media that meet international standards of good journalism to get out of content moderation. But on the other hand we have to make sure that there are no loopholes for those media that do not comply and disseminate disinformation to European citizens,"" MEP Sabine Verheyen said. ""To be blunt: the content you see in your newspaper or on your television will not depend on Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg,"" she added.""On the one hand, we really wanted to allow media that meet international standards of good journalism to get out of content moderation. But on the other hand we have to make sure that there are no loopholes for those media that do not comply and disseminate disinformation to European citizens.""Sabine Verheyen, Member of the European ParliamentThe European Broadcasting Union (EBU) welcomed the improvements made to the text by MEPs, in particular to protect verified media from censorship by platforms. However, the Computer & Communication Industry Association (CCIA), a US organisation whose members include Facebook, Google and Twitter, lashed out against the measure, arguing that â€œthe media exemption will empower rogue actors, creating new loopholes to spread fake news rather than fixing anythingâ€.The MEPs' vote stakes out the Parliament's position on the draft law ahead of negotiations with the EU's 27 Member States.  The provisions of the law designed to protect the confidentiality of sources and journalistic work promise difficult discussions with the EU countries, which adopted their position on the text in June.This article is published weekly.

EU official not head of lab that confirmed bloc's first-ever goat plague outbreak,"Nearly five years after Bulgaria reported the European Union's first-ever outbreak of sheep and goat plague -- also known as peste des petits ruminants (PPR) -- hundreds of social media users shared the false claim that EU official FranÃ§ois Gabriel, who is married to Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Mariya Gabriel, was the executive director of CIRAD when the French organisation was testing samples from the outbreak. However, public records and statements from Gabriel and CIRAD show that this is not true.In 2018, Bulgaria reported the EU's first recorded cases of PPR, a highly contagious viral disease affecting small ruminants like sheep and goats. The samples were taken by the Bulgarian authorities, but the results were confirmed by a lab from CIRAD, a French governmental agency for agricultural research and international development. During the outbreak, owners of sheep and goats from the affected regions had to have their animals slaughtered. The situation provoked public unrest.""Mariya Gabriel is the wife of French citizen FranÃ§ois Gabriel, who was the CEO of a company called CIRAD. Its biolab was in charge of testing samples for a plague affecting domestic animals in eastern Bulgaria,"" begins the lengthy Facebook post . Since August 29, 2023, it has been shared more than 9,400 times.The same claims criticising a so-called ""euro-mafia"" circulated back in May 2023 (here, here) and were also shared by hundreds of users. At the time, Mariya Gabriel was an EU commissioner and had been nominated as her partyâ€™s prime minister-designate. She later became Bulgariaâ€™s deputy premier and foreign minister.Claims of her possible connection to the lab in question appeared around the time of the outbreak in the summer of 2018 (for example, here or here). However, her husband FranÃ§ois Gabriel – the current deputy head of the European Parliament presidentâ€™s cabinet  -- was never the CEO of CIRAD.Screenshot of a Facebook post sharing false information, taken on September 20, 2023 FranÃ§ois Gabriel was never CEO of CIRADAccording to its website, â€œCIRAD is the French agricultural research and cooperation organization working for the sustainable development of tropical and Mediterranean regionsâ€ and has a staff of 1,650 including 800 researchers. It comprises three scientific departments and 29 research units, with Elisabeth Claverie de Saint Martin appointed CEO in June 2021. She took over from Michel Eddi, who held the position from 2013, according to this archived page from the CIRAD website. He was thus in charge during the PPR outbreak in 2018.â€œCIRAD does not know Mr Gabriel,â€ Sophie Della Mussia, the companyâ€™s PR manager, told AFP on September 15, 2023.The French council of ministers appoints CIRADâ€™s chief executive officer. The president's decree is then published in the French state gazette, which is called Journal Officiel. An AFP keyword search of the gazetteâ€™s website revealed CIRADâ€™s entire management history since 1990 and Gabriel was not among those mentioned.A keyword search of CIRAD's website and its activity reports for 2018 and 2022 also yielded no results.â€œI would like to confirm to you that I have, at no time, held any position at CIRAD, an entity that I do not even know,â€ FranÃ§ois Gabriel told AFP in an email on September 14, 2023. He added that his â€œvarious responsibilities in the European Parliament are exclusive and incompatible with such supposed jobsâ€.Regarding the PPR outbreak, Gabriel replied that he had been a â€œdiplomatic advisor in the office of the President of the European Parliament in 2018â€ and â€œobviously had no connection with the subject of peste des petits ruminantsâ€.According to the European Parliamentâ€™s website, Gabriel is now part of President Roberta Metsolaâ€™s cabinet. He is the deputy head of cabinet for external dimension.In February 2017, French media reported that Gabriel was appointed to the cabinet of then EP president Antonio Tajani, with a focus on foreign affairs. Gabriel can indeed be found among the members of Tajani's cabinet on the EP website, which listed ""election observation"" and â€œrelations with the city of Strasbourgâ€ as two of his specialities. The photo used in the false Facebook post is the same as the one for Gabriel on the EP page.Before that, he worked for Joseph Daul, former leader of the EPP Group in the European Parliament, and also served in the Strasbourg mayorâ€™s cabinet.Mariya Gabriel is a former member of the European Parliament (2009-2017) and has also served in the European Commission. She was the EU Commissioner for Digital Economy (2017-2019) and then Innovation (2019-2023).CIRAD and the PPR outbreakIn June 2016, the European Commission launched a call for applications to select an EU reference laboratory for PPR (peste des petits ruminants) and in 2017 CIRAD was designated as such.In June 2018, Bulgarian authorities detected cases of PPR in the eastern parts of the country. They introduced preventive measures such as killing all susceptible animals in the affected villages, establishing protective zones, sampling, etc. Local farmers disagreed with the measures, and there were protests. ""Any delay in culling of the susceptible animals on the affected farms will compromise and delay the eradication of the disease and the reinstatement of the previous disease-free status,"" Vytenis Andriukaitis, the then European commissioner in charge of health and food safety, explained in this letter to a MEP in August 2018. In September 2019, the Bulgarian agriculture minister presented CIRADâ€™s official report on the outbreak to parliament. According to her speech, ""CIRAD detected the presence of the peste des petits ruminants virus in 24 blood samples obtained in June and July 2018â€.â€œCIRAD, as a reference laboratory for peste des petits ruminants, provided confirmatory analysesâ€¦ on small ruminant samples collected from outbreaks/restriction zones in Bulgaria,â€ CIRADâ€™s Della Mussia told AFP. ""All tests carried out in our laboratory on samples received from Bulgaria were transmitted directly to the competent authorities that sent these samples to our laboratory,â€ she added. Protest in front of the Council of Ministers against the mass slaughter of sheep and goats after the outbreak of highly contagious sheep and goat plague near the Bulgarian border with Turkey, on July 18, 2018. (Photo AFP / Nikolay DOYCHINOV)Up to 4,000 animals culledAlthough the post claims that ""tens of thousands of domestic animals had been killed"", this is also misleading.According to the World Organisation for Animal Health's report on the outbreak, 477 goats and 2,506 sheep were killed to prevent the spread of the disease. In October of that year, Rumen Porozhanov, who was the agriculture minister at the time, for his part told parliament that 3,857 animals were slaughtered. In January 2019, Bulgarian authorities announced that they would ease some of the measures regarding PPR. The last international health watch bulletin from the ESA Platform -- the French platform for epidemiological surveillance in animal health -- is from October 2018.Official statistics from the agriculture ministry show an increase in the population of goats and sheep during that time. In November 2017 there were around 1,316,000 sheep and 257,000 goats in Bulgaria. One year later, there were 1,350,000 sheep and 271,000 goats.The owners of the euthanised animals received financial compensation from the state.Rossen BossevAll articlesAFP BulgariaAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU activates diplomatic contacts after escalation of Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"Charles Michel and Josep Borrell have made contact with leaders in the Middle East following a flare-up in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ visited Armenia to assess the situation of displaced Armenians after their exodus from Nagorno-Karabakh. At an informal meeting of EU leaders in Granada, Hungary and Poland vetoed the agreement on new migration rules.EU deploys diplomacy to prevent regional spiral of Israeli-Palestinian conflictBrussels (EFE) – In the wake of the attacks by the Islamist group Hamas against Israel, European Council President Charles Michel and the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell activated several contacts with Middle Eastern leaders this weekend, in an attempt to stop the violence and avoid a regional escalation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.In their many talks in recent hours, Michel and Borrell have stressed the need for a reduction in tensions, an immediate cessation of hostilities, the immediate release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas and respect for human and civil rights on both sides of the conflict.To continue these efforts, Borrell attended a meeting in Muscat (Oman) on Monday with his counterparts from the Gulf Cooperation Council, the main forum that brings together the foreign ministers of the European Union and Oman, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar. Michel said the EU ""stands ready to support the relaunch of the political process through Borrellâ€™s Peace Day initiative with all regional partners."" That initiative aims to encourage the parties to resume peace talks for a two-state solution. (8 October)LenarÄiÄ in Armenia on EU support for Nagorno-Karabakh displaced personsBrussels/Yerevan (STA) – On Friday, European Commissioner for Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ visited Armenia, where more than 100,000 people have been displaced by the conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. Faced with a massive influx of people from Karabakh, LenarÄiÄ is coordinating EU assistance in the South Caucasus country, to which the EU has provided further humanitarian aid.In Yerevan, the commissioner assessed the humanitarian crisis caused by the exodus of the Armenian population from Nagorno-Karabakh, where the Azerbaijani army regained control of the Armenian-majority province in a short operation two weeks ago. Further targeted assistance, in particular through the European Civil Protection Mechanism, was also discussed.The commissioner's visit coincided with the expected arrival in the Armenian capital of an EU emergency aircraft deployed under the European Humanitarian Response Capacity (EHRC), Brussels said. (6 October)Poland and Hungary veto migration chapter in GranadaGranada/Brussels (ANSA) – An informal summit of European leaders in Granada unanimously endorsed the Granada Declaration in all its parts except for the one on migration. Following a veto by Poland and Hungary, this part was replaced by a separate statement from European Council President Charles Michel. In particular, Warsaw and Budapest are contesting the compulsory solidarity mechanism foreseen in the crisis management regulation, the key text of the EU migration pact that is in the process of being adopted.Although only a qualified majority is required, the two Central and Eastern European countries argue that the agreement requires the consent of all member states, based on a principle established by European leaders in the past. Poland and Hungary had been â€œlegally raped"" over migrants, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n said provocatively. â€œAs a responsible politician, I officially reject the whole paragraph of the summit's conclusions on migration. Poland is and will remain safe under PiS rule,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki wrote on X a week before elections are to take place in Poland.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said she â€œunderstandsâ€ the positions of Poland and Hungary, which in any case do not jeopardise the migration pact. A pact in which Meloni, like her European allies, sees no breakthrough. â€œWe voted for the pact because the new rules are better than the previous ones. But I did not make this a priority,â€ the prime minister insisted, stressing the need for a ""structural solution"", i.e., stopping the migration flows. (6 October).Baerbock: Time for the EU to keep its promises to the Western BalkansTirana (ATA) – German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said in Tirana that the time had come for the European Union to deliver on its long-standing promises, adding that the pace of integration into the European Union should be accelerated.Speaking at the press conference after a ministerial meeting, Baerbock stressed that it was particularly clear that the future of the region's youth lay in Europe.""If Europe doesnâ€™t come to them, they will find a way to Europe,â€ Baerbock said. â€œThat is why we all need to accelerate the pace of EU integration. The visit to Kiev made it clear to us that Russia's attack on Ukraine makes the EU membership of the Western Balkans necessary in the geopolitical dimension,"" she added.""We want to walk side by side with you on the road to the EU. This requires new and necessary reforms in the region, but also that we try together within the EU. It is time for the EU to deliver on the promises we made long ago,"" Baerbock concluded.

North Kosovo: a new crisis in the Western Balkans?,"The attack on the Kosovo police carried out by Kosovo Serb gunmen in the northern village of Banjska on September 24 has put the Kosovo issue back on the international agenda. Are Serbia and Kosovo on the brink of another major crisis?Around 30 Kosovo Serb paramilitaries ambushed a Kosovan police patrol in the village of Banjska in northern Kosovo on September 24. They then barricaded themselves in an Orthodox monastery near the northern border with Serbia in an hours-long shootout. The attack resulted in the deaths of one Kosovo police officer and three assailants.The killing of the policeman brought years of distrust and bitterness to the surface, as a war of words between Belgrade and Pristina, competing days of mourning, and calls for sanctions further deteriorated already fractious relations.Kosovo's government has accused Belgrade of backing the entire operation, with Prime Minister Albin Kurti writing that the weapons and equipment used in the attack were ""made by Serbian state-owned military arms producers."" Belgrade denies that while accusing Pristina of discriminating against the Serbian population in Kosovo.Kosovo, a former Serbian province, which today is almost exclusively inhabited by Albanians, seceded from Serbia in 1999 with NATO assistance and declared independence in 2008. Serbia as well as five EU member states – Romania, Slovakia, Cyprus, Spain and Greece -- do not recognise Kosovoâ€™s sovereignty to this day.The EU, with the support of the United States, is mediating in an attempt to normalise relations between the two sides which have worsened since last year.NATO will send additional troops to bolster its Kosovo forceIn response to the deadly attack, NATO deployed additional troops to Kosovo. Two hundred British soldiers arrived in Pristina to reinforce NATO's peacekeeping mission KFOR, the North Atlantic Alliance and London's Ministry of Defence announced on October 6. They will join the 400-strong British contingent already in Kosovo as part of an annual exercise.  In addition, Romania announced the deployment of around 100 soldiers as part of the strategic reserve at the disposal of SACEUR, the Ministry of Defence reports.The German defence ministry said that a company of 155 additional soldiers would be deployed in Kosovo for a year from April 2024. However, the expansion had been decided independently of the recent escalations in the region. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock warned on Friday that ""the situation is so tense that NATO has increased"" the deployment of KFOR, its mission in Kosovo, which currently has about 4,500 troops.Serbia deploys, then withdraws military from Kosovo borderIn the meantime, the United States warned of ""a large Serbian military deployment along the border with Kosovo"" and called on ""Serbia to withdraw those forces from the border."" The build-up ""includes an unprecedented staging of advanced Serbian artillery, tanks, mechanised infantry units. We believe that this is a very destabilising development,"" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters.Following the warning, the White House said Belgrade had begun withdrawing troops from the border.EUâ€™s negotiator BilÄÃ­k: ""The destabilisation of the Balkans suits Putin's Russia""The European Parliament's negotiator for Serbia, VladimÃ­r BilÄÃ­k, said the situation on the ground was seriously escalating and that Kosovo had not seen such violence in the last 10 years.""Both sides have a huge responsibility to return to the dialogue,"" BilÄÃ­k said. He added that dialogue had become more difficult since Kurti became Kosovoâ€™s prime minister. ""We need to find out what exactly happened and we need objective facts. The destabilisation of the Balkans suits Putin's Russia. The only solution is to return to the negotiating table and dialogue,"" BilÄÃ­k said.The spokeswoman of the Russian Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, said in a statement quoted by the agency Ria Novosti that the violence in Kosovo was ""the direct and immediate consequence"" of Prime Minister Kurti's desire to ""provoke a conflict and eliminate the Serbs from the territory of the region.â€ Zakharova added that Kurtiâ€™s push for recognition ""brings the entire Balkan region to a dangerous abyss."" Russia does not recognise Kosovoâ€™s independence.Bosnia and Herzegovina fear spillover of Kosovo crisisThe tension has triggered concern in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) that a larger conflict could spill over to the country. Back in June, the US Deputy Assistant Secretary for the Balkans, Gabriel Escobar, warned in the Atlantic Council that ""if there is no immediate de-escalation, there is a danger that the crisis in Kosovo could turn into a regional conflict.â€The president of the Republika Srpska (RS), Milorad Dodik, in July stressed his support for the ""southern Serbian province"" and accused the international community of seizing Kosovo from Serbia. Dodik said ""Republika Srpska is ready to fight with Serbia for Kosovo,"" he added.The status of Kosovo is one of the foreign policy issues over which the three ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina are in dispute. The Bosnian Serbs fully support the positions of Belgrade, while the prevailing view among Bosniaks and Croats is that Kosovo is a de facto independent state.Kosovo calls for sanctions against SerbiaKosovo's President Vjosa Osmani at the European Political Community summit at the Palacio de Congreso. Foto: Francisco J. Olmo/EUROPA PRESS/dpaAt the European Political Community in Granada on October 5, the president of Kosovo, Vjosa Osmani, asked the leaders to impose sanctions against Serbia, arguing that Belgrade was behind the deadly attacks. In an interview with EFE, she said ""it is very clear that [Serbian President] Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ and Serbia are acting as Putin's proxies in our region and that they want to return Europe to the dark nineties.""In Granada, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban dismissed Kosovoâ€™s call for sanctions as ""ridiculous and impossible."" Unanimity is required for sanctions to be imposed by the EU. Peter Stano, the spokesperson of EU High Representative Josep Borrell, clarified that once they have ""a clear framework about the attack, the EU will decide the next steps.â€Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama suggested that measures against Belgrade â€œshould have been taken immediately,â€ especially those that the European Commission can impose â€œwithout the need for consensus among all member countries.â€ According to Rama, the mere fact that Serbia declared a national day of mourning for the Kosovo Serb gunmen killed in the gunfight was â€œunacceptable and punishable at all levels.â€EU calls on Kosovo and Serbia to reduce tensions and return to dialogueFollowing the attack, European Commissioner for Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi called on Kosovo and Serbia to reduce tensions and return to dialogue during his visit to the Albanian capital Tirana on October 6.VÃ¡rhelyi and Baerbock attended a ministerial meeting of the Western Balkan countries within the framework of the Berlin Process, an initiative promoted by Germany in 2014 to promote cooperation in the region and their accession to the European Union.The commissioner demanded that the perpetrators of the attack, most of whom fled to Serbia, be brought to justice, and demanded full and unconditional cooperation from Serbiaâ€™s judiciary.Release of suspected commando leaderMeanwhile, a Belgrade court on October 4 ordered the conditional release of Milan RadoiÄiÄ‡, the suspected leader of the paramilitaries in the attack.RadoiÄiÄ‡ himself said he had set up the armed group without the knowledge of Serbia. But he denied the charges against him, which include ""criminal association,"" public security offences and having transported and stored weapons and ammunition in Kosovo. He must present himself twice a month to authorities. RadoiÄiÄ‡, 45, is a businessman and former influential Kosovo Serb powerbroker.Between January and the day of the attack, RadoiÄiÄ‡ procured the weapons from neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina and transported and stored them at ""unspecified locations"" in Kosovo, the court said in a statement. Meanwhile, Kosovo President Osmani said that her country wanted to have RadoiÄiÄ‡ and other terrorists handed over to the Republic of Kosovo so that real justice could be delivered.This article is published weekly.

Hamas attack prompts EU to review aid payments to Palestinian people,"The escalation of violence between Israel and the Islamist militant group Hamas has prompted discussions in Brussels over aid programmes for the Palestinian people. The EU has strongly condemned the attack by Hamas on Israel but has sent out mixed messages over the future of its development aid to the Palestinians.The EU is trying to regroup on the issue of aid to the Palestinian people. There is consensus on the following points: support for the Palestinian National Authority is to continue, and Israel must defend itself but respect international law. On Saturday, Hamas militants stormed Israel's border around the Gaza enclave and launched attacks on civilian and military targets, leaving more than 1,200 dead by Wednesday. Israel has responded with artillery and air strikes, and Gaza officials estimate more than 900 Palestinian casualties after five days of ferocious fighting.On Monday evening, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had to qualify announcements on the freezing of development assistance payments. Contrary to Commissioner OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyiâ€™s initial announcement on Monday that all payments would be suspended immediately, the Commission corrected itself by announcing it would review aid payments to the Palestinians.The bloc planned to support the Palestinian people with 1.18 billion euros for the period 2021 to 2024, a press release said.Commission representatives said it had been agreed not to disburse any funds until the completion of a review of aid. ""Our humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. Yet it is important that we carefully review our financial assistance for Palestine,"" von der Leyen said. ""EU funding has never and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity.""The US, the EU and Israel designate Hamas as a terrorist group. There were no payments foreseen at the moment and the review would not concern humanitarian assistance for Palestinians, a Commission press release said.On Wednesday, von der Leyen declared that Hamas's killing of Israeli civilians was a cold-blooded act of war and reflected an ""ancient evil."" She said: ""We have to be clear in defining this kind of horror. And there can only be one response to it. Europe stands with Israel. And we fully support Israel's right to defend itself.""""Our humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question. Yet it is important that we carefully review our financial assistance for Palestine. EU funding has never and will never go to Hamas or any terrorist entity.""Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European CommissionMajority of EU countries against freezing aid for Palestinian peopleThe representatives of the 27 EU countries held emergency talks on Tuesday after the surprise attack by Hamas and as Israel unleashed a reprisal bombing campaign of Gaza. During the informal consultations among EU foreign ministers, an overwhelming majority of European Union countries rejected a proposed freeze on payments to the Palestinian Authority, said EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell.""Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists,"" Borrell said after talks with EU foreign ministers in Oman and via videoconference. ""A collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair, and unproductive. It will be against our interest and against the interest of peace.""France was ""not in favour of suspending aid that directly benefits the Palestinian people"", the French Foreign Ministry said. France contributed 95 million euros in aid to the Palestinians last year.The acting Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, criticised the initial response of Commissioner OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi. He also regretted the EUâ€™s aid review as it seemed to imply that the EU has been financing a terrorist organisation ""for years."" He stressed that ""there is no evidence that this funding has not been used for the purposes for which it is intended.""On Tuesday, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called for sustained humanitarian aid for the Palestinian territories, a day after Berlin said it was suspending development assistance. She also urged the Palestinian Authority to distance itself ""from this terror"" after the Hamas assault on Israel, adding that ""it cannot be justified. As the Palestinian Authority you have a duty, also to your own people."" On Thursday, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said all development aid with the Palestinian Territories was being put under review.Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio Tajani said the review was a result of the new circumstances and that ""there should be no misuse of these funds.""The United States said on Tuesday it welcomed EU support for continuing development aid to the Palestinian people. ""They did reverse that, which is a step that we welcome. We have made very clear that we do not have any grievance with the Palestinian people,"" US State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told reporters.""Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists. A collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair, and unproductive. It will be against our interest and against the interest of peace.""Josep Borrell, High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyEU opposes total siege of Gaza, says BorrellEU foreign ministers also urged Israel not to cut ""water, food, or electricity"" to Gaza and called for humanitarian corridors for those trying to flee the territory, the bloc's foreign policy chief said. The European ministers insisted on the need for ""respect of international humanitarian law,"" Josep Borrell said.  ""Israel has the right to defend (itself) but it has to be done accordingly with international law, humanitarian law, and some decisions are contrary to this international law,"" Borrell told journalists in Oman's capital Muscat. He said the EU meeting called for ""humanitarian corridors to facilitate people who have to escape the bombing of Gaza"" across the border to Egypt.Borrell had also invited Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and his Palestinian counterpart Riyad al-Maliki to an emergency meeting of top diplomats on Tuesday. Later, Borrell said that neither the Israeli foreign minister nor his Palestinian counterpart took up an invitation to address the EU meeting.Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, speaks to journalists. Photo: Francisco J. Olmo/EUROPA PRESS/dpaEU and Arab Gulf States discuss regional impactOn Tuesday, the European Union and Gulf Cooperation Council called for sustained aid for the Palestinian territories following concerns that it could be axed after the Hamas attack on Israel. The latter is a regional, intergovernmental, political and economic union comprising Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Foreign ministers from the two blocs met in Muscat.Fears of a regional conflagration have surged amid expectations of a looming Israeli ground incursion into Gaza, the crowded enclave from where Hamas launched its land, air and sea attack on Saturday.""They stressed the importance of sustained financial support for UNRWA (the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East),"" said a joint declaration read out by Borrell.On Tuesday, the Slovenian government decided that it will allocate 150,000 euros to the UNRWA this year. The dire humanitarian situation made the additional funds all the more justified, the press release said, adding that Slovenia's contributions to the UNRWA usually range from 50,000 to 150,000 euros per year.Future efforts at de-escalationMeanwhile, Ireland's head of government, Leo Varadkar, warned that international support for Israel could wane if the country went too far in its response against Hamas. ""From Ireland's point of view, we are saying to Israel, â€˜Yes, you have a right to defend yourselves (...) but any response must be proportionate,"" Varadkar said, adding that there ""is a risk of violence breaking out in the West Bank and Lebanon and other places.""Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov said â€œthis is a way to shift the world's focus from Russia's attack against Ukraine and an attempt to spread these tensions to larger parts of the world."" He added that the outcome of this crisis would determine what will happen ""in the world for decades ahead.""Italian Foreign Affairs Minister Antonio Tajani emphasised that Italy was ready to contribute towards ""fostering de-escalation between the parties and preventing a widening of the conflict.â€ Tajani will travel to Egypt which is a frequent mediator between Israel and Palestinians.On Wednesday in Cairo, 22 foreign ministers of the Arab League called for an immediate halt to Israeli attacks on Gaza. The final statement said it was necessary to revive the peace process and ""begin serious negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), as the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinians and Israel to achieve a fair and comprehensive peace.""US Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to travel to Israel on Thursday. The US and Israel have traditionally had a close friendship.

Europe in brief: Von der Leyen urges to keep an eye on Iran,"The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has called for the behaviour of Iran, a long-time supporter of Hamas, to be monitored. At a NATO meeting in Brussels, attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, defence ministers seek to increase support for Ukraine. Brussels warned the online platform Meta of a rise in false information.Von der Leyen on Israel: We must closely monitor Iran's behaviourBrussels (dpa) – Following the terrorist attack by the Islamist Hamas on Israel, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned of repercussions for the entire region. ""We will have to work to contain its destabilising effects, including on the ongoing rapprochement between Israel and its Arab neighbours. We will also have to closely monitor Iranâ€™s posture, given its long-standing support to Hamas,"" von der Leyen said in Brussels on Wednesday.The act of terror by Hamas could not be justified by anything and had nothing to do with the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, von der Leyen said. ""Our humanitarian support to the Palestinian people is not in question,"" she added. Nevertheless, EU aid money now had to be closely scrutinised. Europe stood by Israel and supported its right to self-defence, von der Leyen said. (11 October)NATO defence ministers seek to bolster support for UkraineBrussels (Europa Press) – On Wednesday, NATO defence ministers sought to renew long-term military support for Ukraine and bolster its defence capabilities in a bid to send a strong signal to Russia and prevent the conflict from escalating.As part of the Ramstein group, the allies met with Ukraine's new defence minister, Rustem Umerov. The meeting is expected to result in new commitments to the Ukrainian army as part of the alliance's support for the liberation of Russian-occupied territory.The meeting was attended by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called on the Ramstein Group coalition countries to provide more air defence systems and long-range missiles to protect Ukraine's critical infrastructure and counter Russian forces on Ukrainian territory.He also expressed support for Israel in the wake of the Hamas attack and called on world leaders not to leave the Israelis alone at this time.Alongside Zelensky, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg expressed the allies' support for Kiev ""for as long as it takes"" and said that further commitments would come out of the meeting.

Brawl scenes falsely said to show migrants in Lampedusa,"As large numbers of migrants landed on the Italian island of Lampedusa this summer, social media users  published video footage purporting to show the newcomers attacking Italian police. However the claim is false. The clip actually shows a fight from 2021 that took place outside of a nightcub in Marotta, central Italy.""In Italy. Direct clashes between migrants and police began on the island of Lampedusa. Illegal immigrants throw stones at the carabinieri and demand that they be sent to Europe,"" says a September 17, 2023 X post.Screenshot of an X post taken on September 20, 2023The claim can be found elsewhere on X, TikTok and on Facebook in English and French.Approximately 8,500 people docked in Lampedusa in the space of a few days in mid-September, more than the entire population of the Mediterranean island. The European Union presented on September 17, 2023, an emergency plan for Italy to help with the record number of migrants.The news fueled outrage among European far-right politicians who claim the asylum seekers are plunging the European Union into a migration crisis, sparking debates on illegal immigration. Some like Marine Le Pen, the leader of the French far-right, claimed the country was being ""submerged by migration.""https://youtu.be/x2Npb-Y8GV8But the images of migrants landing on the tiny island have created a sensationalized depiction of African migration according to experts.""Lampedusa is getting all the attention because the pictures are impressive and because there is a phenomenon of 'over-concentration', of hyper-visibility linked to the fact that the island is tiny and the reception center is overwhelmed,"" Camille Schmoll, an expert on migration told AFP.The video showing violence toward Italian law enforcement was amplified amid rising tensions. But despite the claim, the footage was not shot in Lampedusa in 2023, but in another region of Italy in 2021.AFP used the InVID/WeVerify tool to split the video into a series of still images, allowing for a reverse image search on Yandex which found the it shared in an X post published in 2021 in Flemish by Belgian far-right parliamentarian Sam Van Rooy (archived here).Screenshot of an X post taken on September 20, 2023This led AFP to multiple Italian news articles (archived here, here and here) that reported on the 2021 incident -- a brawl outside a club involving several foreign nationals, during which two police officers were injured while intervening., describing the incident as having taken place in the town of Marotta in central Italy -- not on the island of Lampedusa.Internet keyword searches for ""Marotta 7 August 2021"" also uncovered a tweet from far right politician Matteo Salvini, who is currently the deputy prime minister of Italy, confirming the location (archived here).AFP has debunked other false claims regarding migration here.September 22, 2023 This article was updated to only reference Italian news coverage of the 2021 brawl.Fabien ZAMORAAll articlesAFP USAAll articlesAFP FranceAll articlesTranslated byNatalie WADEAll articlesMigrationFacebook Twitter EmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Slovak diplomat Ivan KorÄok continues to collect signatures for his presidential candidacy.EU member states call for respect of all citizens' rights in Israeli-Palestinian conflictBrussels (Belga) – On Sunday, the 27 EU member states issued a joint statement calling for the rights of all citizens to be respected in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.In the statement, the EU countries condemn Hamas and its brutal terrorist attacks on Israel. They stress that Israel has the right to defend itself, albeit in line with humanitarian and international law.Hamas is called upon to release the Israeli hostages immediately and without conditions. The 27 stress the importance of urgent humanitarian aid and say they are ready to support civilians in Gaza, while ensuring that this support is not misused by terrorist organisations. Finally, they reiterated the importance of a two-state solution.Also on Sunday, Josep Borrell, the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, said that the blocâ€™s foreign policy is defined by European leaders and the 27 foreign ministers. He was responding to comments by Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who had pledged Europe's unequivocal support for Israel on Friday, drawing criticism from several MEPs. On Saturday, the Commission announced an increase in the humanitarian aid budget for Gaza from 25 million euros to 75 million euros.On Tuesday, European leaders will hold extraordinary consultations on events in the Middle East. They will meet by video conference at 17:30.

""If you want to intensify your trade relationship with the EU – call us,"" Lindner, referring to the British government, told the BBC on the sidelines of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank in Marrakech.He said London had a ""standing invitation"" for talks with the EU on how to reduce trade barriers. ""We really appreciate the United Kingdom and its values, its people,"" Lindner said. Therefore, he would welcome more intensive trade relations.The UK left the EU at the end of January 2020 and the EU customs union and single market in January 2021. Despite a far-reaching trade deal, businesses on both sides of the Channel have since complained about a huge increase in red tape, making it harder to use labour, for example. Tariffs are now in place in some industries. Britain has dropped out of Germany's top ten of trading partners.

""So, I can say that I am on a very good way to meet the legal requirement of 15,000 signatures from citizens, and will thus be able to run for the post of head of state as a civic candidate,"" he added.KorÄok announced his intention to run at the end of August. Diplomat and former foreign minister JÃ¡n KubiÅ¡ is also collecting signatures for a civic presidential candidacy. If either KorÄok or KubiÅ¡ were to win the presidential election, Slovakia would for the first time have a career diplomat with a good reputation abroad as head of state. Both candidates are a guarantee that the country will remain in the European and Euro-Atlantic community.The head of state is elected by the citizens of the Slovak Republic in direct elections by secret ballot for a five-year term.

Record turn-out in Polish parliamentary election paves way for pro-EU government,"More than 74 percent of eligible voters flocked to the polls on Sunday in the largest voter turn-out since the fall of communism in 1989. In a surprise result, Donald Tuskâ€™s pro-European opposition is set to dethrone the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party after eight years of rule, even though it remained the single strongest party in the Polish parliament.The opposition, led by former Polish Prime Minister and President of the European Council Donald Tusk, had billed Sunday's parliamentary elections as the ""last chance"" to save democracy in the country. Now, the three opposition parties (Civic Coalition, Third Way and the Left) have won enough seats to end the Law and Justice (PiS) partyâ€™s reign, under which Polandâ€™s relations with the EU have dramatically soured. ""This is the end of grim times,"" Tusk declared late on Sunday.â€œA triumph of both democracy and liberalismâ€According to the Polish National Electoral Commission on Tuesday, right-wing PiS remained the strongest single party but without a majority at 35,38 percent (194 seats) of the votes. The centrist and pro-European electoral alliance Civic Coalition (KO) headed by Tusk followed with 30,7 percent (157 seats). The centrists from Third Way scored 14,40 percent (65 seats) and the leftist several-party-alliance Left 8,61 percent (26 seats). The far-right Confederation got 7,16 percent (18 seats) of the votes.Despite having obtained more votes than any of its rivals, PiS does not have much room for manoeuvre to establish alliances. Its belligerent attitude throughout the legislature, with confrontations and disqualifications towards practically the entire political spectrum, has ended up isolating it ideologically. The party had increased its nationalist rhetoric in its campaign and even entered a row with its war-torn neighbour Ukraine. PiSâ€™ only realistic coalition partner is the ultra-right Confederation party but even with their seats it would not be enough to create a governing majority. In addition, both groups also said they do not want such a union.Tuskâ€™s coalition, however, has the easier path to forming a government with a majority in parliament by going into coalition with the Third Way party and the Left. This coalition of coalitions – which would in total encompass more than a dozen parties – would hold 248 seats in the 460-member Sejm, the lower chamber of the parliament.Putting the liberal opposition in power would bring a huge political shift in Poland, countering the PiS party's nationalist hardline Catholic vision for the country. To the opposition electorate, ending the PiS reign would also restore Poland's reputation on the international stage. Tusk has pledged to rebuild relations with Brussels and to unblock EU funds frozen due to an ongoing standoff with Warsaw over the rule of law in Poland.Piotr Buras, head of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a pan-European think tank, said that these elections were ""a triumph of both democracy and liberalism"". The election was dominated by issues such as Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, migrants and women's rights.The victory of the pro-European opposition is all the more significant because it was achieved in extremely unequal conditions, despite biased public media and the fact that the ruling party used the financial and institutional power of the state to its advantage.Electoral observers found that PiS exploited its public media power in the elections. ""The observer mission found that while public television gave free airtime to all contestants, its political coverage clearly promoted the ruling party and its policies and at the same time demonstrated open hostility towards the opposition,"" the observer team from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said in Warsaw on Monday.#Polandâ€™s parliamentary #elections were competitive but marked by misuse of public resources and public media bias, international observers say.

Only after PiS gives back the mandate due to the lack of majority in the parliament, Duda will offer the mandate to the leader of the opposition, most likely Donald Tusk. ""This government will have a strong and hostile anti-European opposition – PiS and the far-right Konfederacja [Confederation]– representing more than 40 per cent of the voters,"" says ECFR-Warsaw head Buras.Given the foreseeable ""hunt for turncoats"" that could be unleashed from the governing party, the mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, a prominent figure in the KO, said on Polish television that he was ""convinced that there will be attempts"", but ruled out that there could be so many desertions as to ""prevent a new government.""The Minister of Education, Przemyslaw Czarnek (PiS), warned that ""the war is about to begin"", in reference to the manoeuvres with which the PiS will tempt its rivals to attract them into its orbit.Furthermore, some experts have pointed out the fact that such a heterogeneous coalition could be ineffective and could soon become involved in centrifugal disputes.People hold the Polish flag and the European flag as they attend an anti-government demonstration organized by the opposition in Warsaw on June 4, 2023. Coming from all over Poland, the demonstrators took up the call of the leader of the main centrist opposition party, Donald Tusk, to protest against ""high living costs, swindling and lies, in favor of democracy, free elections and the EU"". Photo: Wojtek Radwanski/AFPâ€œPoland is backâ€ in the European project, but change wonâ€™t happen overnightThe (preliminary) election result was greeted with relief throughout the EU – and is bound to have effects in the short and medium term in Brussels, markedly slowing down the right-wingâ€™s ride across Europe. The Visegrad axis comes out of the Polish elections bruised, as Hungaryâ€™s Victor Orban loses a key ally in his challenge of EU values.""Poland is back,"" declared Manfred Weber, the head of the European People's Party (EPP), the biggest grouping in the European Parliament, in Strasbourg on Monday.The applause met relief in other EU institutions as they contemplated a changed political direction for the bloc's sixth-biggest economy, away from the nationalist/populist lines driven by the outgoing government, which had openly defied Brussels on several issues.Since 2015, PiS has been one of the major spoilers of EU efforts to reshape the bloc's migration and asylum policy. Two years ago, Poland's Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared EU law – which is meant to overrule any national legislation – ""incompatible"" with the Polish constitution.Some EU peers, including France, saw that as an assault against the European Union and what it stood for. The result was Poland being dragged before the European Court of Justice, where a legal battle continues.A political analyst and president of the Institute of European Studies at the UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles, Ramona Coman, said that, while it often occurred that individual countries complained their interests were being trampled on at EU level, ""the Polish and Hungarian governments went much further by challenging the legality and legitimacy of the European Union itself"".The EU is about to regain ""a partner that is more conciliatory, more positive and more open to compromise,"" Lukas Macek, the head of the Centre Grande Europe and research fellow at the the Jacques Delors Institute think tank in Paris, predicted.But he cautioned against a ""black-and-white vision"" of future relations, saying: ""Not everything will radically change. There will be a transition, with a reduced margin for manoeuvre.""Ursula majority strengthened, Conservatives and Reformists downsized?The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), chaired by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of the Fratelli dâ€™Italia (FDI), could come out of the vote downsized. With the Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki no longer in government, she could find herself at a crossroads in the coming months: to move closer to the EPP, and thus to the majority, or to remain at the side of her Polish ally.Morawiecki and PiS were and remain one of the main obstacles to a post-election alliance between FDI and the centre-right. Now that the Polish premier has emerged defeated in the elections, the negotiating power of ECR, and therefore of FDI, is bound to drop significantly.""Who knows what will happen now in Italian politics and in ECRâ€ is the reflection of an EPP leader who does not hide the fact that Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s majority emerges from the elections in Warsaw certainly more solid. The new Polish premier could make their EU debut at the December European Council.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Europe in brief: von der Leyen calls for protection of Jewish life in Europe,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is concerned over the increase in antisemitic incidents in Europe and calls for better protection of Jewish life. In other news: Franco-German nuclear tensions, as France insists on the recognition of the role nuclear power can play in the production of low-carbon hydrogen. The next steps are taken towards a digital euro as a complement to cash.Ursula von der Leyen wants better protection of Jewish life in EuropeStrasbourg (dpa) – Jewish life in Europe must be better protected, according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The increase in anti-Semitic incidents including desecrated synagogues, incitement and fake news was simply unacceptable, she said in a debate on the terrorist attack by Islamist Hamas against Israel in the European Parliament on Wednesday. She stated it was our shared responsibility to ensure that the dark past did not return.Specifically, von der Leyen promoted the commission's proposal to add hate crimes and incitement to the list of EU criminal offenses that must be sanctioned throughout the Union. It was time for member states to act, she said, referring to their legislative powers. EU funding for the protection of places of worship, such as synagogues, had already been increased, von der Leyen said. In addition, the Commission is currently investigating whether the platform X, formerly known as Twitter, is fulfilling its obligation to counter the spread of terrorist propaganda and incitement.""Europe's history is a history of diversity,"" von der Leyen said. ""European Jews must be able to wear a kippah or a Star of David on our streets and bring light to our cities with the candles they put in the windows for Hanukkah. We must make good on Europe's promise to be united in diversity to be a safe place for all Europeans,"" she added. (October 18)France insists on recognition of role nuclear power can play in low-carbon hydrogen productionBerlin (AFP) – On Wednesday, France reiterated its call for nuclear power to be recognized as a potential means of producing low-carbon hydrogen, thus exposing itself to a new confrontation with Germany over the role of atomic energy.""The development of the hydrogen market will be delayed if there is no equal treatment between renewable hydrogen and low-carbon hydrogen,"" said French Ambassador to Germany FranÃ§ois Delattre in Berlin.""There is still a lot of progress to be made on this equal treatment, and we must work together to achieve it,"" added the French representative. At present, the nuclear issue divides France and Germany in several of the ""green"" texts being drafted in Brussels.Delattre spoke during a presentation on the future H2Med submarine pipeline in Berlin, which aims to transport hydrogen from the Iberian Peninsula to the rest of Europe and is presented as â€œthe first green hydrogen corridor to Germany.â€ (October 18)ECB takes next step toward digital euroFrankfurt (Belga) – The European Central Bank (ECB) decided on Wednesday to give the green light for the preparation phase of the digital euro. After two years, the research phase for the digital euro has been completed. The preparatory phase should now pave the way for the possible future digital euro, the ECB says in a press release. Specifically, the Frankfurt-based bank will complete the rule book and the selection of providers for the development of the platform and infrastructure. The preparation phase starts on November 1 and will initially last for two years. After completing this phase, the ECB should decide whether to take the next step towards a digital currency.â€œWe need to prepare our currency for the future. We envisage a digital euro as a digital form of cash that can be used for all digital payments, free of charge, and that meets the highest privacy standards. It would coexist alongside physical cash, which will always be available, leaving no one behind,â€ said the President of the European Central Bank, Christine Lagarde.The European Commission opened the door to the digital currency in late June. The EUâ€™s executive then proposed a legal framework allowing for its introduction. At the same time, the Commission prepared a draft law to ensure the status of coins and banknotes as legal tender.Banks would be able to obtain the digital euro from the ECB. Consumers would have the digital currency at their disposal in a digital wallet and be able to make quick payments around the clock via smartphone, for example, even if there was no internet connection. However, the effective introduction of the digital single currency could take another 4 to 5 years. (October 18)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

Several Schengen countries tighten border controls to curb illegal immigration,"A number of countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia have announced new controls along their borders. They are trying to prevent people smugglers from using routes through the Balkans to bring migrants to Central and Western Europe. This puts pressure on the Schengen area of free movement and visa-free arrangements with third countries.Border controls are being introduced due to challenging security conditions and the increased threat of terrorism in Europe following the recent outbreak of violence in the Middle East as well as terrorist attacks in France and Belgium. In some countries, the situation is fuelling support for right-wing political parties.The countries tightening controls are all members of the European Union and of Europe's Schengen open-borders zone. Central European countries in particular have recently seen a growing number of migrants and asylum seekers coming largely from Serbia via Hungary and heading to wealthier Western European countries.The reintroduction of border checks in the Schengen area is permitted in exceptional circumstances, and Brussels must be notified before implementation.Recent terrorist attacks cause concernNonetheless, European leaders have repeated calls for better protection of the EU's external borders and reaffirmed their cooperation on migration in the wake of the deadly attack in Brussels on Monday. Two Swedish football fans were shot dead near the stadium where Sweden was playing Belgium to qualify for the Euro 2024 tournament.The terrorist militia Islamic State (IS) later claimed responsibility for the attack. The suspected perpetrator was a rejected asylum seeker from Tunisia who, according to authorities, was staying illegally in Belgium. Belgian police shot the 45-year-old man in a cafÃ© in Brussels on Tuesday morning and he died of his injuries.A more united European approach was needed ""to tackle the root causes of what we have seen here in recent days,"" Belgium's Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said Wednesday in Brussels at a joint press conference with his Swedish counterpart Ulf Kristersson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Earlier, the leaders had jointly paid tribute to the victims of the attack.Von der Leyen said that a European proposal had been on the table for some time ""giving Member States the power to expel persons who have received a return order if they are considered a threat to national security.â€ The proposal – a revision of the European Return Directive – is part of the much-discussed migration pact. ""Knowing that Belgium will hold the next presidency, I am confident that we will be able to get this pact over the line,"" Von der Leyen said.Following Italy's decision to introduce border controls on the Slovenian border due to the outbreak of violence in the Middle East, Slovenia has announced a revised regime that will apply to its borders with Croatia and Hungary.In Croatia, which entered Schengen only at the beginning of this year, Slovenia's decision to introduce temporary border controls has become a pre-election topic and attracted a lot of attention. Since the next 2024 is a super-election year in Croatia with parliamentary, European, and presidential elections, the temporary introduction of border controls triggered heated debates between the government and the opposition. The Croatian government presented the entry into Schengen as its great success, and now after border controls are re-introduced not even a year after joining Schengen, the opposition wants to present it as a failure of the government. Some right-wing parties have proposed building walls and sending the army to guard the borders. The government firmly rejects this and claims that it has enough police officers and equipment for effective border protection.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Wednesday that the international situation made it necessary for Italy to suspend the Schengen Treaty after her government decided to reintroduce controls at Italy's border with Slovenia from Saturday October 21.The Spanish government has avoided raising the anti-terrorist alert to the maximum. For the time being, Spain has no plans to introduce police checks at its borders with other European Union countries.Nancy Faeser, Germany's Minister of the Interior and Home Affairs, presents the Federal Situation Report on Organized Crime 2022 at the Federal Press Conference.

Foto: Bernd von Jutrczenka/dpaMigration issue fuels the (far-)rightA surge in migrant arrivals in recent months, mainly from Syria and Afghanistan, has reignited a fierce immigration debate in Germany with local authorities saying they are overwhelmed by the number of asylum seekers. The influx has fuelled support for the far-right, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, which made major gains in two regional elections this month.Germany is set to introduce fixed border checks at entry points from Poland, the Czech Republic and Switzerland, the Interior Ministry announced on Monday. While Switzerland is not in the EU, it is part of Europe's Schengen open-borders area.Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Monday notified the European Commission of the plans, which will mean the possible introduction of police checks directly at the borders between Germany and its three neighbours.Rethinking visa regimesOn Wednesday, MEPs approved a new law to digitise Schengen visas, making them more secure and accessible. By digitising the visa application process, the law aims to reduce the cost and effort of applying for a visa, while ensuring harmonised practices across Europe and improving security.Slovak MEPs from across the political spectrum welcomed the European Parliament's approval on Wednesday of the law on the digitisation of Schengen visas. However, European countries that currently have visa-free travel arrangements with the EU are concerned about the re-imposition of visa regimes with the bloc.Currently, the EU requires Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), for example, to introduce visas for countries under the EU visa regime, an obligation arising from an agreement between BiH and the EU from 2010. Although 13 years have passed, BiH has still not fulfilled this obligation, which could jeopardise the country's visa-free status. The European Commission has reserved the right to recommend to EU interior ministers the possible suspension of the visa-free regime if BiH does not comply with EU visa policy.Citizens of North Macedonia can travel visa-free, transit or make short stays of up to 90 days in any 180-day period in Schengen countries. However, from 2024, around 1.4 billion people from more than 60 visa-free countries, including North Macedonia, will need a travel authorisation to enter most European countries through the European Travel Information and Authorisation System (ETIAS). It costs â‚¬7 to apply for an ETIAS travel authorisation, although some travellers are exempt from paying this fee.In October, the Commission adopted a proposal to strengthen the visa suspension mechanism in order to better address emerging security and migration challenges. The visa suspension mechanism allows the EU to reintroduce the visa requirement for a third country in case of a significant increase in irregular migration or security risks.Bregana border crossing between Croatia and Slovenia, December 8, 2022. Photo: Uncredited/AP/dpa Schengen accessions on the tableEuropean Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson said on Thursday after a meeting of EU interior ministers that internal controls, even when justified by strong security reasons or by illegal border crossings, should be avoided because they hindered the free movement of people and goods.The delegations from Romania and Bulgaria – both in the process of joining the Schengen area – presented the measures they have adopted to tighten border controls and enhance EU security. Johansson praised Romania's progress in the field of border control, migration and asylum.""I do not see any reasonable obstacle for Bulgaria not to be accepted into Schengen by the end of this year,"" Bulgarian Interior Minister Kalin Stoyanov told Bulgarian journalists in Luxembourg, where he participated in the meeting of his EU colleagues. The Spanish EU Presidency hopes to reach an agreement in the Council in December to give the green light to the accession of both countries.This article is published weekly.

Polish ruling party used misleading images for campaign ads on EU migration,"Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki used campaign ads for this monthâ€™s general election to condemn the European Union's ""tragic, irresponsible migration policy"" but many of the images were taken out of context or had nothing to do with migration to the bloc. The videos had been viewed more than 10 million times on social media ahead of the vote on October 15, 2023 â€“ which saw the opposition win a parliamentary majority -- and showed scenes of attacks on women, unnamed burning cities or long marches of men in the desert. Although supposedly linked to the recent migrant crisis on the Italian island of Lampedusa, an AFP investigation found that the provocative footage in fact came from as far away as the United States and dated as far back as 2016. The jumble of violent scenes was mixed with genuine images of migrants on Lampedusa.The campaign ads were linked to a controversial migration referendum scheduled for the same day as the election by Morawiecki's eurosceptic Law and Justice (PiS) party. In power since 2015, the PiS had been challenged by a pro-European opposition that together won more votes than the governing conservatives. Polandâ€™s current government and its ally Hungary are opposed to an EU plan for migration reform.On September 15, 2023, Prime Minister Morawiecki released the migration-themed campaign ad on X (formerly known as Twitter) and Facebook in which he alleges that former Polish prime minister Donald Tusk and former German chancellor Angela Merkel are responsible for an EU policy that has led to ""rape, to robbery, to vandalising streets, to looting European cities, to chaos and conflagration."" Many of the clips feature Black men in scenarios designed to make white women look unsafe around them.On September 19, 2023, the PiS released a shorter campaign ad on Facebook and X , also on the theme of migrants. The post's caption reads: ""There is another big wave of illegal immigrants in southern Europe."" But the blend of images we can see in this party propaganda does not specifically link to criminal activity by migrants in the EU, or the genuine upsurge in migrant arrivals to Lampedusa in recent weeks.An attack on two women occurred in Seattle, United StatesOne of the most violent images from Morawiecki's campaign ad is at 02:18, where we see a Black man beating a white woman following footage of men waiting on small boats in the sea. We traced the original clip using reverse image search techniques and found a version of this video published on September 10, 2023 by the ""@RadioGenoa"" account on X (archived here) and Telegram. This English-language account largely posts misinformation about migrants, as we have found from previous investigations. Thanks to this longer video we traced another version of the video in which a logo appears for ""Tower 12 Apartments"". That led us to this building in Seattle, US, and we uncovered articles in Spanish-language US media on this incident from September 11, 2023. As such, the incident neither occurred within the EU's borders nor features recent migrants, and the circumstances of the skirmish are disputed.Screenshot of  Morawiecki's Facebook post (left). Screenshot of an article from El Heraldo de Mexico. Comparison made by AFP on October 10, 2023. Cross added by AFP.The next scene we see is of a Black man simply walking past a white woman at 02:24, overlaid with Morawiecki asking: ""Are there ghettos in Poland? No. Is there fear of going out on the street in the evening in Poland? Is there fear of rapes? No!"" Burning cars and street violence are seen before another clip of an attack on women. These contextless images are not explained, simply drawing a racist allusion before we rapidly move on.Woman kicked down stairs on Berlin metro was a victim of Bulgarian attackerAlso in Morawieckiâ€™s clip  (at 02:40 on X), we see a woman kicked down a flight of stairs by a man. We divided the clip into frames and conducted a reverse search. ""In Poland there is no problem of illegal migrants,"" the prime minister says. This led us to a 2016 article published in The Guardian, and another from German newspaper Bild, which published the metro video with the following caption: ""On the stairs from the S-Bahn to the platform of the Berlin U8 on Hermannstrasse."" The man was identified at the time as an asylum seeker, with many saying it was further proof that Germany had become less safe since allowing around 1 million refugees into the country in 2015.But in fact, police later revealed the attacker was a Bulgarian national named Svetoslav Stoykov, and not a recent arrival to the EU from Africa or Asia, as circulating misinformation had claimed. In December 2016, he was arrested, other media reported (here , here)  and in 2017 sentenced ""to almost three years in prison"".Screenshot of Morawiecki's Facebook post (left). Screenshot of a Bild article. Comparison made by AFP on October 10, 2023. Cross added by AFP. March scenes are from Libya and Slovenia We now turn to the PiS's shorter campaign ad on Facebook and X , also on the theme of migrants. The clip contains the same mix of out of context images with tinges of racism. At 00:15 we see hundreds of men marching in the desert. In a previous debunk,  AFP demonstrated that the footage does not show migrants escorted by soldiers on their way from Libya to Italy as suggested by social media users, but was shot on the Libyan-Egyptian border when a mass deportation of migrants from Libya to Egypt was carried out in June this year. There are some real images of migrants marching within the EU's borders, but not in Lampedusa, and not from the last few months. At 00:16 in the PiS video we see a flow of people marching in green fields. Using reverse image searches we found a longer version of the video which was taken from a drone by AP reporters on 25 October, 2015 near the villages of Rigonce and Dobova, (archived here) showing migrants and refugees marching through Slovenia --  mostlySyrian citizens fleeing civil war. AFP already debunked false suggestions about the location of this video here.More than 8,000 people streamed into Slovenia from Croatia that day, as the Eastern European nation become a new key transit point on the migrant route.Screenshot of a PiS post on Facebook (left). Screenshot of AP footage on YouTube. Comparison made by AFP on October 10, 2023. Cross added by AFP.  ISIS attack on Brussels in 2016 Additionally, at the 00:48 minute mark of the PiS campaign ad, we see images of destroyed buildings while the prime minister says that his government has ""successfully defended our borders from the wave of illegal immigrants"". These images are from a 2016 Islamic State attack on an airport and metro station in Belgium. We can notably see the footage on the BBC ( archived here). These attacks were carried out by French and Belgian nationals, not illegal immigrants in Lampedusa.The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks which left at least 31 dead and more than 220 injured. Screenshot of the PiS post on Facebook (left). Screenshot of BBC footage on YouTube. Comparison made by AFP on October 10, 2023. Cross added by AFP. The Morawiecki clip also shows a destroyed train. We traced these images and found them on CBS (archived here) in a report on the terrorist attack at the Maelbeek metro station, with no direct connection with Lampedusa.The PiS clip also contains the same images of the attack on the woman in the Berlin metro at 00:28. Screenshot of the PiS post on Facebook (left). Screen of a CBS report. Comparison made by AFP on October 10,2023. Cross added by AFP. Religious procession from Leicester  Finally, on October 4, 2023, PiS released another clip about migrants on Facebook and  X. At 0:11, images of a procession of men dressed in black and walking down a street are shown. We found the same images on the RadioGenoa account. We conducted more searches and found the original footage on TikTok. This was taken during a religious procession in Leicester organised by the Muslim community, in a clip entitled: ""Annual Mawlid Procession 2023"". The event was entirely peaceful.Screenshot of Morawiecki's Facebook post (left). Screenshot of a TikTok post. Comparison made by AFP on October 10, 2023. Cross added by AFP. AFP has debunked more myths around migration to the EU here and here.Located just 90 miles (around 145 kilometres) off the coast of Tunisia, Lampedusa is one of the first points of call for migrants crossing the Mediterranean.A surge in asylum seekers has rekindled a fierce debate in Europe on how to share responsibility for the tens of thousands reaching the continent each year.Fine weather has seen more arrivals in recent weeks. Most are picked up at sea from rickety boats by the coastguard, which brings them to Lampedusa port. More than 127,000 migrants have arrived on Italy's shores so far this year, almost double the number in the period last year. But many do not survive the journey by sea. More than 2,000 people have died this year crossing between North Africa and Italy and Malta, according to the UN migration agency.Maja CZARNECKAAll articlesAFP PolandAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Borrell defends EU support for Israel,"EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the EUâ€™s support for Israel has not harmed the blocâ€™s image in the Arab world.

The European Parliament has awarded the Sakharov Prize to Mahsa Amini.Borrell denies that EU reaction to Gaza crisis damaged the blocâ€™s image in the Arab worldNew Administrative Capital, Egypt (EFE) – EU High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell has denied that the EUâ€™s reaction in support of Israel and its right to defend itself against Hamas has damaged the blocâ€™s image in the Arab world, but ""quite the contrary.""Borrell said this in a meeting with the Spanish media during the Egypt Peace Summit, which brought together 34 countries and international organisations to discuss the humanitarian, political and military crisis in the Gaza Strip.Borrell stated that support for Israel's right to defence was always accompanied by the consideration that it should be done within the margins of the law. ""On the contrary, I think the Arab world very much appreciated that we said, and that I, in particular as (EU foreign policy) spokesman, said that Israel's logical defensive reaction had to be in accordance with humanitarian law,"" he said. (21 October)Minister of Culture VreÄko to call on EU colleagues to sign Ljubljana ManifestoFrankfurt (STA) – At the next meeting of the European ministers of culture, Slovenia will call on all EU ministers to sign the Ljubljana Manifesto on higher-level reading on behalf of their governments. Slovenian Minister of Culture Asta VreÄko made this announcement on Saturday at the Frankfurt Book Fair, where Slovenia was this year's guest of honour.""Public office holders, those at the very top, we need to be most aware of the importance of the word, the importance of information, of knowledge and also of public discourse, and so we feel it is right that the manifesto should also be supported at political level,"" the minister said.. The Ljubljana Manifesto, which advocates the promotion of reading at a higher level as key to the development of analytical and critical thinking, was one of the three pillars of Slovenia's programme at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Poetry and philosophy were the other two.The first to sign it was Canadian writer Margaret Atwood.The Ljubljana Manifesto stresses that analytical and critical thinking is the key to maintaining a democratic society. Reading skills are threatened by the digital age, which emphasises entertainment and statements that provoke strong emotional reactions, often anger, but even more often hatred.The manifesto was written by four individuals involved in reading research. They are the co-curator of the Slovenian presentation at the fair, publisher Miha Kovac, Anne Mangen from the University of Stavanger, Andre SchÃ¼ller-Zwierlein from the University of Regensburg and Adriaan van der Weel from the University of Leiden. The manifesto is supported by various associations, including the World Association of Publishers, the European Publishers Association, the International Association for Young People's Literature, the European Association of Reading Promotion Societies and the German Academy of Language and Literature (21 October).(FILES) A protester holds a portrait of Mahsa Amini during a demonstration in her support in front of the Iranian embassy in Brussels on September 23, 2022, following the death of an Iranian woman after her arrest by the country's morality police in Tehran.

Three words that have become a rallying cry for all those standing up for equality, for dignity and for freedom in Iran,â€ Metsola added.The death of Mahsa Amini, aged 22, led to months of large-scale demonstrations in Iran, the repression of which resulted in hundreds of deaths and thousands of arrests.The â€œWomen, Life, Libertyâ€ uprising has continued in various forms and is emerging as one of the biggest challenges to the Iranian authorities since the 1979 revolution. (19 October 2023)EU Commission sends questions on fake news to Meta and TiktokBrussels (dpa) – In view of the war in Israel, the European Commission is demanding more information from Facebookâ€™s parent company Meta on how it fights fake news and hate speech. Tiktok must also provide details about false information.The Commission sent an official request for information on Thursday under the EU's new Digital Services Act. Meta and Tiktok must now explain within a specified period which measures they have taken, for example, to prevent terrorist or violent content on their platforms and to limit misinformation.Depending on their answers, the Commission could decide to open formal proceedings and impose fines. Last week, European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton had already sent a letter warning against too much manipulated content related to the war in Israel and upcoming elections in Europe.Under the new EU law, platforms such as Facebook, X, Google and many others will have to take tougher action against illegal content such as hate and incitement online. Failure to do so could result in heavy fines. (19 October)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

German EPP Group Delegation visits the European Newsroom,"German Christian Democrat MEPs, part of the European People's Party, visited the European Newsroom (enr) in the Residence Palace in Brussels on October 25. The purpose of their visit was to acquaint themselves with the project and to see how Europe-wide cooperation in journalism works on the ground.What is the European Newsroom exactly? How does it work on a day-to-day basis? How exactly do the participating agencies collaborate? These and many more questions were raised by MEPs and their staff during their visit to the European Newsroom in Brussels. As a collaborative journalistic project, the European Newsroom brings together nearly 20 news agencies across Europe. The enr representatives detailed the processes of editorial exchange, the collaborative development of stories and the search for topics of EU-wide significance. Apart from the editorial collaboration, the enr team explained how the collaboration does not end there but how joint interview requests with top politicians and the sharing of press briefings can improve journalism. In addition, the enr staff touched on the topic of educational trainings as the enr offers workshops on fact checking and mobile journalism for its members. MEP Sabine Verheyen and MEP Marion Walsmann were among the visitors to the enr. They were joined by staff from the offices of MEP Christian Ehler, MEP Angelika Niebler, MEP Rainer Wieland, MEP Hildegard Bentele as well as staff from the CDU/CSU press office in the European Parliament. The European Newsroom was represented by Christiane DÃ¼sterfeld (dpa), Ivonne Marschall (dpa) as well as the managing editors of the enr Victoria Becker and Ivana DrmiÄ‡.Find out more about the participating agencies and the work of the enr here. The editorial work can be found in the joint background articles, the Key Story,  and the EU news selection, the EU Digest. Editorial Managers in the enr Victoria Becker and Ivana DrmiÄ‡ talking to the EPP Group in the European Newsroom in the Residence Palace, 25 October 2023, Brussels.

"Turkey a hundred years later: Erdogan, successor and competitor of AtatÃ¼rk","One hundred years after Kemal AtatÃ¼rk proclaimed the Turkish Republic, the country is trying to balance between east and west. Recep Tayyip Erdogan wants to leave his mark on the destiny of the country to the detriment of its illustrious founder by imposing the idea of a ""Century of Turkey"".On October 29, Turkey marks the 100th anniversary of its modern republicâ€™s birth. The program of celebrations was only published a week before and the government â€œhas not even extended invitations to foreign leadersâ€œ, according to Soli Ã–zel, professor of International Relations at the Kadir Has University in Istanbul.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is accused by his detractors of praising a ""new Turkey"" which is more conservative and more religious. The Turkish president is thus preparing a new constitution: This new constitution would guarantee women the right to wear the veil in all circumstances, would establish ""the family (as) the foundation of society"" and would stipulate that marriage can only be entered into ""between a man and a womanâ€œ as Erdogan has mentioned very frequently during his campaign since his re-election, and again last week.Since its founding, the Justice and Development Party (AKP) has â€žstrived to build an identity and alternative narratives to the Republicâ€œ, notes Seren Selvin Korkmaz, director of the Istanbul Institute of Political Research. ""The polarisation of Turkey has even extended to the centenary celebrations: the AKP speaks of the 'Century of Turkey', others of the 'Second Century' of the Republic,â€œ she added. Apart from shaping Turkish politics and society, Erdogan appears also strongly aware of the geopolitical influence he can wield.Erdogan unblocked Swedenâ€™s NATO accessionAfter a 17-month diplomatic standoff, Erdogan signed the Stockholm accession protocols on Monday and sent the documents to the Parliamentary Assembly in Ankara for ratification. He stressed that the final decision will be made in the parliament, where his party, the AKP, has a majority along with its ally, the ultranationalist Nationalist Movement Party (MHP). The Secretary-General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, and the Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson, were confident of a rapid entry of Sweden into the alliance.The Turkish president said earlier that he would give his approval to Sweden's accession ""if the US keeps its promisesâ€œ, referring to the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Turkey, blocked by the US Congress.Ankara lifted the veto and allowed Finland to join the Atlantic Alliance in March, but only after the removal of the embargo on the sale of arms to Turkey that Helsinki had imposed in 2019, following Turkish operations against Kurdish forces in northern Syria. Finland, which applied to join NATO at the same time as Sweden, was granted membership in April. Turkey repeatedly accused Sweden of harbouring outlawed Kurdish militants and demanded their extradition. Erdogan also asked Sweden to take measures over Quran burnings at protests in the country that have angered many in Muslim countries. Turkey and Hungary are the last NATO members that have not yet ratified Sweden's entry, which must be approved by all members before it becomes effective. If the green light also comes from Hungary, Sweden will probably be able to join the alliance before the meeting of NATO foreign ministers scheduled for November 28 and 29 at the headquarters in Brussels.Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson and Secretary-General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg at a press conference in Rosenbad, Sweden. Photo: Jonas EkstrÃ¶mer/TT News Agency/AP/dpaTurkey 'no longer expects anything' from EU, Erdogan saysIn Ankaraâ€™s relations with the EU however, no progress seems in sight. The Turkish president said on October 1 that his country ""no longer expects anything from the European Union, which has kept us waiting at its door for 40 years"". ""We have kept all the promises we have made to the EU but they have kept almost none of theirs,"" he said, adding that he would not ""tolerate any new demands or conditions on the accession process"" for his country to join the bloc. In July ahead of the EU's Foreign Affairs Council on Turkey, Sloveniaâ€™s Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon had stressed that a discussion about Turkey's EU membership bid made sense if the country showed a sincere interest. Regarding the number of challenges such as migration, the Cyprus issue, and Turkey's mediator role in the Ukraine war, there was a lot to talk about. Mediator in the Ukraine warLast year, Turkey offered itself as a mediator between Ukraine and Russia, helping to broker a deal that allowed safe grain exports via the Black Sea. Ever since, Turkey has been in talks with both sides about reviving the deal, which collapsed after Russia pulled out less than a year later.Both Russia and Ukraine are preparing for a gruelling winter ahead, with Ukraine warning of renewed strikes on its energy infrastructure and Russia trying to suppress a Ukrainian counteroffensive.On October 21, President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that Turkey will take part in peace talks at the end of October to discuss the end of the Ukraine war. ""Turkey will participate, adding its authoritative voice and stance,"" Zelensky said. Russia is not expected to take part in the talks, which Zelensky hopes will rally support for his own peace plan.The Mediterranean island of Malta is hosting the round of Ukraine peace talks on October 28 and 29, after similar meetings in the Saudi city of Jeddah and Copenhagen earlier this year. Representatives from around 40 countries including China, India, the United States and Ukraine took part in the Saudi summit, which did not result in a final declaration.Erdogan calls Hamas freedom fightersIn Erdoganâ€™s first response to the deadly October 7 attacks by Hamas, the Turkish president had taken a measured tone, condemning all attacks against civilians and urging Israel to be measured in its response. But he became much more vocal after the deadly strike on Ahli Arab hospital in Gaza last week, when Hamas immediately after the explosion accused Israel of shelling the hospital. Israel, on the other hand, said a misguided rocket from Gaza was responsible. The explosion led to protests across the Muslim world.On Wednesday, he said he was cancelling plans to visit Israel because of its ""inhumane war"" against Hamas militants in Gaza. The Turkish leader added that he did not view Hamas as a terrorist organisation but as ""liberators"", fighting for their land, drawing swift and angry condemnation from the Israeli government.Ankara maintains contacts with Hamas and, according to its own statements, is trying to secure the release of hostages. Hamas is considered a terrorist organisation in the US, Europe and Israel, but not in Turkey. Erdogan spoke on the phone with the head of Islamist Hamas, Ismail Haniya. According to Turkish sources, Erdogan said that a lasting peace solution in the Middle East is only possible with a Palestinian state within the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital. He said that Turkey would continue to advocate a lasting peace solution on the international stage. The press service of the Turkish government announced on Saturday on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), that Turkey will continue to work for a ceasefire in the region as soon as possible. Erdogan also wanted to seek further humanitarian aid for the Gaza Strip.Turkeyâ€™s activities in the Western BalkansTurkey expanded its influence in the Western Balkans in recent years, mainly in the regionâ€™s countries with a Muslim population. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) Ankara expanded its presence through the opening of educational institutions, but also through large infrastructure projects and networks of Turkish entrepreneurs. Turkey has invested more than 284 million Euro in the infrastructure of BiH and the Belgrade-Sarajevo highway project worth four billion Euro, financed by Ankara, was also announced.In a recently published report on foreign trade by the Albanian Institute of Statistics for the period January to July 2023, Turkey ranks as Albania's third largest trading partner, accounting for 6.8 percent of the volume. Turkey taking over NATO Kosovo mission KFORTurkey is also flexing its muscles in Serbia and Kosovo. On October 25, Turkeyâ€™s Chief of the Armed Forces YaÅŸar GÃ¼ler met with Serbiaâ€™s Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister MiloÅ¡ VuÄeviÄ‡ in Belgrade. ""Turkey has a large and significant political, economic, security and cultural influence and importance for the area of the Western Balkans,"" said VuÄeviÄ‡.While GÃ¼ler stressed that Turkey will support Serbiaâ€™s EU accession, another dominant topic was the security issue in Northern Kosovo. The NATO-led force KFOR in Kosovo changes command on a regular basis, last in October. The Turkish General Ã–zkan Ulutas took over leadership of the 4,500-strong force. It comes at a time of renewed tensions between Kosovo and neighbouring Serbia. On September 24, Kosovo Serb paramilitaries ambushed a Kosovan police patrol in northern Kosovo, which is almost exclusively populated by Serbs. Three Serbs and one Kosovo police officer died in the shoot-out.""We are encouraged by the assurances we received from Mr GÃ¼ler regarding the security of the Serbian community in Kosovo and Metohija,"" said VuÄeviÄ‡. He added that Serbia will insist that ""on the administrative line towards Kosovo and Metohija, only members of KFOR should be present on the Kosovo-Metohija side and that joint patrols by members of the Serbian Army and members of KFOR should continue along the administrative lineâ€œ. Serbia also encourages ""a direct communication between the Chief of the General Staff in the Serbian Armed Forces and the KFOR commanderâ€œ, he added. Turkey distancing itself from the West?With the Turkish Republic entering its second century, the question remains in which direction Erdogan is trying to steer the country and if he will ultimately be successful.For Berk Esen, a professor at Sabanci University in Istanbul, ""Erdogan is pushing for a Second Republic, more conservative, more Islamic, which distances itself from the Westâ€œ. ""He tries to leave his mark on all important political fields and on all projects. But whether it is celebrating the country's independence or honouring the armyâ€œ, of which the president is commander-in-chief, â€œMustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk is everywhere,â€ notes the academic. â€œHe has not completely succeeded in erasing it, but that is probably what he will try to do after 2023,â€  expects Esen.This Article has been edited and corrected.

"Austrian Chancellor Describes Schengen's Expansion as ""Unthinkable"", Says That Has Nothing to Do with Bulgaria, Romania","Austrian Chancellor Nehammer said it was â€œunthinkableâ€ to expand Schengen at the moment, but this had nothing to do with Bulgaria and Romania. During a first visit to Brussels, Polish opposition leader Tusk vowed to restore Poland-EU relations. The European Commission doubles funding for wind energy to 1.4 billion euros.Vienna (BTA) – If Bulgaria and Romania were in the Schengen area, they would be much more effective in supporting the processes to curb migrant pressure in Europe, Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov argued during a working visit to Vienna. Denkov met with Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer, parliamentarians and the Union of Austrian Industrialists.â€œIf the borders between Bulgaria and Greece, and Bulgaria and Romania, are abolished, Bulgaria will be able to free up human and material resources to better protect the EU's external borders – especially between Bulgaria and Turkey and between Bulgaria and Serbia. Freight will not wait for days at the EU's internal borders, which will reduce the cost of transporting goods from Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania to Central, Eastern and Western Europe. This means lower food prices and lower inflation. It means better political stability in all the countries of Eastern and Central Europe. We will only benefit from this. Whereas if we stay outside Schengen, we all lose,â€ said the Bulgarian prime minister.He believes that in December, at the regular European Council meeting, everyone will be prepared ""to take the decisions that are most beneficial for the people of Austria, for the people of Bulgaria and for the European Union, because this is our common goal.""â€œFor us it is unthinkable at the moment to extend Schengen, but this has nothing to do with Bulgaria and Romania, it is a security issue,â€ Nehammer said at a press conference after his meeting with the Bulgarian prime minister. â€œSchengen must be fixed. Until it is fixed, we cannot expand this area,â€ Nehamer added. He noted that 11 EU countries have introduced checks at internal borders.The EU foreign ministers themselves were saying that the Schengen system was not working. More and more countries were now introducing border controls, which meant that the Schengen system was not living up to its true meaning. The EU knew very well that Bulgaria and Romania were contributing to Schengen and that is why it should support them financially, the Austrian chancellor stressed. (October 24)Tusk promises to restore Poland's position in EUBrussels (Belga) – On Wednesday during a first visit to Brussels since his country's parliamentary elections, Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk assured that he wanted to ""restore Poland's position"" in Europe.""My objective today is to restore my country's position in Europe and make the European Union as a whole stronger,"" Tusk told at a press briefing with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.In Poland's elections on 15 October, the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party again received the most votes, but there is little chance that it can stay in power. Tusk and his liberal-conservative Civic Coalition (KO) gained a majority together with the left-wing alliance Lewica and the Christian-conservative Third Way.President Andrzej Duda has not yet appointed anyone to form a government. But it is widely assumed that Tusk will lead a coalition that will put the Eurosceptic policy to an end – which Poland has pursued since PiS took office in 2015 – and return the country to a more constructive role in the EU.Tusk said the election results and high voter turnout showed to the whole of Europe ""that democracy, rule of law, freedom of speech and European unity are still important for our citizensâ€, adding that ""I am proud of my compatriots. They have proved that the anti-democratic and anti-European mood does not have to be a trend.â€During the campaign, Tusk had promised to work towards the release of 35 billion euros from the European recovery fund. That money had been blocked amid the ongoing dispute between the EU and Poland over judicial reforms that undermine the independence of Polish judges.

This will require a massive increase in installed wind capacity, with an expected growth from 204 gigawatts (GW) in 2022 to more than 500 GW in 2030.""We want the wind energy sector to remain a historic success story in the EU,"" stressed Vice-President for the European Green Pact Maros Sefcovic at a press conference, where he admitted that the sectorâ€™s future growth was facing a number of ""unique"" challenges.

"Chatbots, deepfakes and more: Workshop on artificial intelligence with dpaÂ ","On October 30, the European Newsroom hosted a full-day online workshop on artificial intelligence, facilitated by dpa. Participants learned about deepfakes, technological possibilities of AI and how it may impact their journalistic work.Artificial Intelligence is one of the hottest topics when it comes to recent technological developments. How can it be tamed, how can it be used – and, does it have the power to eventually replace us?Not only in the European Union but also on a global scale, the subject has been high on the agenda for political leaders, public and private sector figures and the general public, warning about its potential hazards and the need to regulate. The journalistic profession has also been following the subject closely.Photoshop and CGI fakes in Hollywood films have been around for decades. With artificial intelligence, it is much easier, cheaper and faster to create false claims – it is democratising the ability to fake.This image of Pope Francis in a Balenciaga puffer coat has been widely circulated on the web. Participants learned what to look for in AI-generated images. Source: PopBase/XStefan VoÃŸ, head of verification at the German Press Agency dpa and board member of the European Fact-Checking Standards Network (EFCSN) and Patrick Neumann, head of dpa-academy and recruitment officer, facilitated the full-day workshop.Around 25 participants from 13 news agencies participating in the European Newsroom project learned about how current programmes can be used to create or altertexts, images, audio and videos and learned that AI-generated images are images – and not (fake) photos.In practical examples, participants learned about the inner and outer logics which could unmask an artificially created image. Clues to look for could include: Are hands, ears and hair looking off? Are there any inconsistencies in collars or jewelry? Can other recordings of the scene be found? Does the reaction of onlookers seem plausible or rather strange?Throughout the workshop, the facilitators and participants lively discussed the potentials, pitfalls and dangers of artificial intelligence in journalism.",1
Doctor's misleading vaccine claims spread online,"Vaccines against Covid-19 are estimated to have saved millions of lives during the pandemic, yet false and misleading information about their safety continues to circulate online. During an event at the European Parliament in September 2023, US cardiologist Peter McCullough claimed that mRNA vaccines have caused a ""wave"" of severe side effects, and called for them to be banned. A video of the talk has circulated widely in several languages, including Swedish. However, as experts told AFP and as multiple scientific studies show, while the vaccines have adverse effects, severe cases are extremely rare, and several of the conditions mentioned by McCullough are more common following Covid-19 infection, rather than vaccination. Moreover, McCullough's talk was not an official hearing at the EU parliament, as online publications suggested, but part of an event organised by a handful of MEPs.An 18-minute video entitled ""Dr. Peter McCollough in an expert hearing in the EU-parliament"" was uploaded onto the online video platform Rumble on September 17, 2023 and since shared more than 1,100 times on Facebook.In the video, McCullough, a cardiologist who has become known for spreading disinformation, talks about the pandemic and mRNA vaccines, claiming that patients were incorrectly treated and that the vaccines have caused a second ""wave of injury"", following the first wave of Covid-19 itself. Ultimately, he calls for the vaccines to be banned.The video comes with a Courageous Discourse logo, referring to McCullough's website and newsletter.Screenshot of the video with the false claims (taken on 5.10.2023)The video has also circulated in other languages, including German, English and Slovak.AFP has debunked several claims made by McCullough, for example here and here.Contrary to McCullough's claims, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) states that millions of lives have been saved by Covid vaccines (archived version) and there is ""no evidence of an increase in deaths related to Covid-19 vaccination in any age group"" (archived version).As the agency explains, the vaccination programme against Covid-19 is the largest of its kind in history, with almost 1 billion doses of the vaccines administered in the EU and EEA. Researchers have estimated (archived link) that during the first year of Covid-19 vaccination the vaccines more than halved the global death toll due to Covid-19. The WHO has estimated that there were 14.9 million excess deaths associated with the pandemic in 2020 and 2021 (archived version).In an email to AFP on September 26, a spokesperson explained that ""before their authorisation, the vaccines were tested in tens of thousands of participants in randomised controlled clinical trials to confirm they met EMAâ€™s scientific standards for safety, efficacy and quality"".""With a COVID-19 death toll of over 6.9 million people worldwide reported to WHO, and over 23 million estimated excess deaths linked to the pandemic, with still unknown long-term consequences of the disease, the human cost of natural immunity to COVID-19, letting the virus infect an unprotected population, is not tolerable,"" they said.On July 12, 2023, the European Parliament stated in a resolution (archived version) that the vaccines authorised in the EU were effective in avoiding serious disease and death.McCullough's September talk is rife with more specific misleading and false claims. Experts interviewed by AFP said that so far the benefits associated with Covid vaccines outweigh their risks, with severe adverse effects rare and lesser than those associated with the illness itself. Research into the benefits and risks of the vaccines continues, they said.Talk not an official hearingThe video title refers to an ""expert hearing"" at the EU parliament, and its description links to MEP Christine Anderson's website, which advertised an ""expert hearing in the EU Parliament"" on September 13, 2023 entitled ""Health & Democracy under WHO's new proposed rules"". It lists several speakers as well as five MEPs as hosts. Behind McCullough, a banner with the German text ""Identitat und Demokratie"" is visible, referring to a far-right group of MEPs.However, the talk was not an official hearing.As explained on the parliament's website, a parliamentary committee is ""permitted to organise a hearing with experts, where this is considered essential to its work on a particular subject"", explaining that ""most committees organise regular hearings, as they allow them to hear from experts and hold discussions on the key issues.""The website lists all committee hearings. There are no hearings listed for September 13 when the event involving McCullough took place.In an email to AFP on September 28, the European Parliament press service confirmed that the event ""was not an official event of the European Parliament and it was not organised nor funded by the European Parliament"".""It would seem that some MEPs took part in the event. As mentioned in Article 2 of the EP Rules of Procedure, Members of the European Parliament 'shall exercise their mandate freely and independently, shall not be bound by any instructions and shall not receive a binding mandate,'"" they added.Amount of vaccine mRNA declines over timeDuring his talk, McCullough makes several misleading and false claims about the safety of Covid mRNA-vaccines.https://youtu.be/NGjppkdEYHcmRNA-vaccines against Covid – that is, Pfizer BioNTech's and Moderna's vaccines – contain mRNA which instructs the recipient's cells to produce spike protein, a protein that enables the coronavirus to enter cells. The immune system starts to produce antibodies and specific white blood cells against the protein, so that if it later encounters the actual virus, it will produce an immune response. Other vaccines, such as the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines, are so-called viral vector vaccines, which also contain the genetic instructions for the protein, but they come in a weakened virus. Protein-based Covid vaccines, such as Novavax's vaccine, are in turn based on specific parts of the virus that the immune system must recognise to create a response, coming with a laboratory-made protein fragment.From autumn 2023, Sweden's Medical Product's Agency recommends vaccination against Covid-19 with Pfizer's mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) or Novavax's protein-based vaccine (Nuvaxovid).In the video, McCullough claims that mRNA and spike protein continue circulating in the body, and that mRNA cannot be broken down, resulting in a range of adverse effects. He alleges that ""there's not a single study showing that the messenger RNA is broken down."" However, according to experts, this is not correct.Frederic Altare, from Inserm, France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research, told AFP in July 2023 that the ""production of spike protein is very transitory, which is enough to induce a particular immune reaction to spike, but the injected RNA as well as the proteins the production of which it induced are disintegrated very quickly."" On September 5, 2023, he added that recently ""certain modifications made to the vaccine RNA as well as to the spike protein it produces have improved the life expectancy of both the RNA and the protein it produces, in order to improve their capacity to activate a stronger immune response."" However, he added that only pieces of this spike protein could remain in the body, and that ""for the time being nobody has shown any activity from these kinds of fragmentsâ€.A spokesperson for the Swedish Medical Products Agency said in an email on September 29 that free mRNA is eliminated fast by RNA-breaking enzymes, whereas because a vaccine has mRNA within lipid particles, the mRNA is protected for as long as the particles are intact, meaning that mRNA can be detected for longer.Bowen Li, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto specialising in RNA vaccines and therapeutics, agreed. ""mRNA breaks down quickly in tissues and blood, often within days, due to its inherent fragility,"" he told AFP on October 6. ""This characteristic explains the meticulous handling and strict cold storage requirements for mRNA vaccines.""The spokesperson also said that the breakdown of mRNA and spike protein has been observed empirically, contrary to McCullough's claim. ""The small amounts of spike protein that are produced make it hard to determine how quickly it is eliminated. Therefore a study has been done where one used mRNA for a protein that can be detected through emitting light (luciferase). The maximal expression of the protein was seen after 9 hours. After 9 days the protein could still be detected but the amount was more than 1,000 times lower than after 9 hours.""In addition, this fact check by Health Feedback (archived version) lists a number of studies pointing to the limited lifespan of vaccine mRNA.McCullough also refers to ""papers by Castruita"" showing ""mRNA circulating for a month"" as evidence for his claims.He does not give exact references for the research he cites, but an online search brings up a study (archived version) by Castruita et al., published in APMIS, a journal of pathology, microbiology and immunology, in March 2023.The researchers found ""full-length or traces of SARS-CoV-2 spike mRNA vaccine sequences"" in the blood up to 28 days after Covid-19 vaccination in 10 out of 108 samples from patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, the findings cannot be used to support McCullough's argument that vaccine mRNA does not disappear from the body.""There is no evidence for long term persistence over time,"" Henrik Westh, the corresponding author for the paper and clinical professor at the Department of Clinical Medicine at the University of Copenhagen, told AFP on September 29. He explained that the coverage, or how much vaccine is seen, is ""high just after vaccination, declines over time and is gone after 28 days in our cohort of patients"".""There are no data on any side effects associated with our findings. I believe in fact that it could be an advantage for the immune response to Covid vaccination,"" he said.Graphic showing messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ( AFP / John SAEKI, Laurence CHU)Higher risk of cardiovascular complications with Covid-19 than vaccinesMcCullough goes on to claim that the vaccine spike protein causes ""four major domains of disease"". He names ""cardiovascular disease"" as the first domain, mentioning myocarditis, ""acceleration of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease"", heart attacks or ""cardiovascular arrest"", postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), aortic dissection, atrial fibrillation and other arrhythmias.However, there is a higher risk of cardiovascular complications with Covid-19 than the vaccines, experts say.Of the conditions mentioned by McCullough, only myocarditis -- inflammation of the heart muscle -- along with pericarditis – inflammation of the lining around the heart – are noted in the Pfizer (archived version) and Moderna (archived version) product information documents. Both of them come under ""very rare"" side effects in the documents as well as on EMA's website.This was confirmed by Peter Liu, vice president of research and chief scientific officer at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute, in an interview with AFP on October 4. ""It is true that there are these rare incidences of myocarditis and pericarditis following the mRNA vaccines and a little more common with Moderna than Pfizer initially and generally in young men,"" he said. ""The incidence is still very, very low, less than eight per million.""""The risk for myocarditis exists for virtually all viral diseases, and even if Covid didn't have as big a risk for myocarditis per case as for example influenza infection, there were many cases of myocarditis globally because of the illness because so many got ill,"" Mats Borjesson, a professor at the University of Gothenburg, told AFP on October 10. He specialises in sports cardiology, among other things.""The risk of myocarditis in the case of Covid infection is clearly higher, which altogether leads to a clearly reduced risk of myocarditis if you have been vaccinated,"" he said. ""Myocarditis secondary to vaccination also means a milder form of myocarditis than secondary to infection.""A Nordic study (archived version) published in May 2022 found that 9-28 people in 100,000 contracted myocarditis after Moderna's vaccine, and 4-7 in 100,000 after Pfizer's vaccine. Cases were ""very rare"" and most common among 16-24-year-old men. Most of the instances were found to be mild.In October 2021, the Public Health Agency in Sweden decided to stop giving the Moderna vaccine to those born in 1991 or later, citing the risk of myocarditis as a reason. It pointed out, however, that the ""risk for an individual to be affected is very small"".McCullough cites a paper he has co-authored, allegedly showing that 100% of deaths after vaccination where myocarditis is suspected are due to the vaccine. AFP identified the paper as a preprint published in 2023, looking at 28 autopsy cases with ""COVID-19 vaccine-induced myocarditis as a possible cause of death"". Preprints have not undergone peer review, and their quality can vary vastly.Stuart Ray, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University who specialises in virology, pointed out several issues with the preprint. ""It is rife with inaccurate statements about COVID-19 vaccines and misleading citation of sources. The report's retrospective analysis of 28 autopsies conducted during a time period associated with 1 billion doses of vaccine does not provide evidence of a causal link between vaccination and cardiovascular complications. The authors do not adequately address confounding causes and other important limitations,"" he told AFP on October 4.Liu added that in many of the cases cited in the paper, the patients were in a very old age category. The age is not compatible with myocarditis associated with vaccines, he said.As for the other complications mentioned by McCullough, Liu explained that while they are sometimes reported post-vaccination, they are common conditions and associations with the vaccines are incidental.""Whether vaccines could also cause other serious cardiovascular events, like the infection itself does, has been debated,"" Borjesson said. ""Case reports have been written (atrial fibrillation etc.) but there is a lack of population-based studies that support this. A study showed no increase in myocardial infarction after vaccination while another study showed a smaller risk of myocardial infarction after Covid-19 in fully-vaccinated people. When it comes to stroke, there have been conflicting results (increased and decreased risk).""Liu explained that there is some discussion of the risks with Covid-19 itself. ""For example, he talks about the acceleration of atherosclerosis or orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and atrial arrhythmias. These are actually associated with Covid. These are actually some of the features of long Covid,"" he said of McCullough's claims.Ray agreed. ""Vaccination to prevent COVID-19 is very uncommonly associated with cardiovascular complications -- and the latter are more commonly associated with COVID-19,"" he said.McCullough goes on to claim that the ""cardiovascular domain of damage in the human body from the vaccine is substantial, more than anything we've ever seen with cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes.""Liu referred to a paper (archived version) by the Global Cardiovascular Risk Consortium published in The New England Journal of Medicine in October 2023, which identified five common risk factors for cardiovascular disease.""Particularly high blood pressure is the leading cause, high cholesterol is next, diabetes as the major driver of the cardiovascular mortality worldwide,"" Liu said of the findings. ""You have to keep in mind that high blood pressure occurs in one in four people,"" he said, adding that heart attacks and strokes are not seen in the numbers that would be expected if they were associated with the vaccines as McCullough claims.Ray confirmed this. ""With the exception of rare cases of myocarditis (which is more strongly associated with COVID-19 infection than with the vaccines), there is no rigorous evidence to support the suggestion that mRNA vaccination to prevent COVID-19 carries risk of cardiovascular [complications] comparable to high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure, or diabetes mellitus.""McCullough also links myocarditis caused by the vaccines to cardiac arrests among young athletes. AFP has debunked several similar claims in the past, for example here and here.Preparations take place at Stockholm's City Hall to convert the venue for the Nobel Prize banquets into a Covid-19 vaccination centre for a day on February 21, 2021.( AFP / Jonathan NACKSTRAND)Risk of blood clots higher with Covid than vaccinesMcCullough also mentions ""blood clots like we've never seen before"". He claims that the spike protein is ""the most thrombogenic protein we've ever seen in human medicine"".Clotting complications have been associated with vaccines against Covid, but these have been linked to the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines, both viral vector vaccines, rather than the mRNA vaccines.""Some adenovirus vector based COVID-19 vaccines have, rarely, been associated with more serious blood clotting complications. Serious blood clotting complications are not strongly associated with mRNA vaccination,"" Ray said.Liu added that ""there is actually this cerebral venous thrombosis risk which is very, very low, which occurs more commonly in middle-aged women (...) but is actually associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine which is a more traditional viral based vaccine.""Borjesson said there was ""no evidence"" for the description of spike protein as the ""most thrombogenic protein"".Liu explained that blood-clotting is a more common complication in patients infected with Covid-19, commonly believed to be linked to the ACE2 receptor, used by the virus to enter the target cells.Ray also underlined that blood clots are more common with Covid-19 rather than vaccines. ""A striking feature of the initial wave of COVID-19 was clotting complications – and available evidence suggests that mRNA vaccination to prevent COVID-19 is far less strongly associated with blood clotting than the disease they prevent,"" he said.AFP has fact-checked several claims about vaccines and blood clots, for example here and here.Neurological and immunological side effects very rarely associated with adenovirus vaccinesThe two other so-called domains of disease McCullough mentions are neurological and immunological side effects. More specifically, he lists stroke, Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome, ascending paralysis, small fiber neuropathy, numbness and tingling, ringing in the ears and headaches as examples of the former, and vaccine induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia and multisystem inflammatory disorder as examples of the latter.However, while possible links between vaccines and many conditions are researched, causal links between mRNA vaccines and most of the conditions have not been established.Of the conditions listed my McCullough, only headaches are mentioned in the Pfizer and Moderna production information documents, under ""very common side effects"".AFP showed the list of adverse effects to the Swedish Medicinal Products Agency. ""A very large number of different kinds of events, including what is listed in the question, have been reviewed for a possible causal link with the Covid-19 vaccines. For those types of events where a causal relationship seems plausible, they are classified as side effects and listed in the product information,"" they said, adding that other cases are monitored. ""It is important to remember that these vaccines have been given to a very large number of individuals around the world (millions) and that a great number of these individuals have had other illnesses before vaccination and/ or are affected by (worsened) illness at some point after vaccination even if there is no causal relationship.""Li agreed. ""It's essential to distinguish between events that occur after vaccination and events caused by the vaccine,"" he said, explaining that while rare side effects beyond the commonly observed ones have been reported, the causal relationship between the vaccine and many of the severe conditions listed by McCullough is not established.EMA's safety committee looked into cases of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare condition affecting many parts of the body, reported after Covid vaccination, but to date concluded there was insufficient evidence on a possible link between the vaccines and the syndrome.Some of the conditions mentioned by McCullough have been linked to other Covid vaccines than the mRNA ones.

Europe in brief: Slovenia extends border controls by 20 days,"The Slovenian government has decided to extend border controls with Croatia and Hungary until 19 November. Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg urges EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell to stick to the EU leaders' summit declaration on the Middle East. French President Emmanuel Macron hopes the Putin-Orban meeting will not weaken EU unity.Slovenia extends border controls with Croatia and Hungary until 19 NovemberLjubljana (STA) – On Friday, the Slovenian government extended controls at the borders with Croatia and Hungary by 20 days, until 19 November. It explained that, as before, surveillance would be targeted and focused on preventing terrorism, extremism and cross-border crime.Slovenia introduced border controls on 21 October, following Italy's decision to control its border with Slovenia. Both countries cited threats to public order and internal security in the EU, the situation in the Middle East and Ukraine as well as the prevention of terrorism as reasons for their decision to temporarily reintroduce controls.On Thursday in Brussels, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said he expected Italy would lift border controls by Christmas, so that Slovenia could do the same at the borders with Croatia and Hungary. While Rome has already indicated that controls are likely to continue throughout the winter, there has been no official confirmation from the Italian government on the possible extension of border controls.The re-establishment of surveillance and how to minimise its impact on those citizens of the three countries who cross the border on a daily basis will be discussed on 2 November in Trieste by the interior ministers of Slovenia, Italy and Croatia. On 14 November, Golob will visit his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni, with whom he will also discuss border surveillance.In an interview published on Friday, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ told France24 television that border controls within the Schengen area did not prevent terrorism and the rise of extremism. He stressed that the solution was to protect the EU's external borders and to align the visa policies of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia with those of Brussels. He also announced a meeting with Meloni and Golob.

""Gaza is in complete blackout and isolation while heavy shelling continues,"" Borrell wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Saturday. Austria's Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg then reminded Borrell of the EU summit decision.""On the situation in the Middle East, it is imperative to stick to the positions clearly expressed by Heads of States and Governmentsâ€ within the European Council,"" Schallenberg wrote on X (Twitter) on Saturday evening, addressing Borrell.EU leaders had agreed at the summit this week to condemn Hamas for its brutal and indiscriminate terrorist attacks in Israel, as well as to Israel's right to defend itself in accordance with international law. It also called for ""humanitarian corridors and pausesâ€ for humanitarian needs in Gaza.Borrell stressed that the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNWRA) warned of the desperate situation of the people in Gaza, who were without electricity, food and water. ""Far too many civilians, including children, have been killed. This is against International Humanitarian Law."" A pause in the fighting was urgently needed to allow humanitarian access, Borrell further wrote. ""We condemn all attacks against civilians, including continuing indiscriminate rocket attacks against Israel, and we ask for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.""

""That does not shock me,â€ he added, referring to the meeting in China in mid-October between OrbÃ¡n and Putin, who has become a pariah for the West since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.""What I ask.... is that, in the situation we are in vis-a-vis Russia, we do not use these bilateral contacts to negotiate things... which would weaken the unity that is ours,â€ Macron added.On his arrival in Brussels on Thursday, the Hungarian Prime Minister made no secret of the fact that he had wanted to have this meeting. (27 October)Germany supports Albania in the water sectorTirana (ATA) – The Albanian deputy prime minister and minister of infrastructure and energy, Belinda Balluku, and the German ambassador in Tirana, Karl Bergner, signed a 50-million-euro agreement focusing on the improvement of drinking water supply systems as well as waste water disposal and treatment in several municipalities in Albania.Balluku said that the agreement will contribute to the improvement of the drinking water supply system and waste water treatment with special focus on the tourist areas.The Performance and Investment Programme in the Water Sector is an initiative of the Albanian Government, supported by the German Government through KfW, the European Union and the Swiss Government. It aims to improve water supply utilities at the local level by strengthening capacities in line with best practices and in alignment with European standards.The German development cooperation with Albania began in 1988 and since then the German government has committed more than one billion euros to development projects.

Europe in brief: Von der Leyen visits Western Balkans to discuss EU enlargement,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visited BiH as part of a four-day tour of the Western Balkans to discuss EU enlargement. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner questions Germany's ability to phase out coal as an energy source by 2030. Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ hopes his country would join the OECD in 2026.Von der Leyen: In order to make progress, Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to act unitedlySarajevo (FENA) – The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, paid an official visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The visit was part of a four-day trip to North Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia and BiH.During her visit to BiH, von der Leyen presented the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans as well as the region's roadmap towards the European Union.After the meeting with the chairwoman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Borjana KriÅ¡to, von der Leyen stated that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina was in the European Union, as a single, united, sovereign country.''My first message is to underline that the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina is in the European Union and I want to emphasize how much we want BiH to be a full member of the EU. I emphasize how strong our support is on your European journey. You showed us through the formation of the government last year and everything that was done in the first year after the elections, all of that shows that this country can achieve results, and I think that's positive,'' said von der Leyen. Her second message was that ""we must work on bringing our economies together.""''This arrival today is an opportunity to present the new Growth Plan of the European Union for the countries of the region. This is important for all of us in BiH, and I think that we should all use the opportunity both in the region and in BiH to make a significant step forward based on this Growth Plan that is provided to us in the field of ensuring quality conditions for the life of all residents of BiH in all segments of life – from road infrastructure and energy to freedom of movement of goods and services,'' KriÅ¡to said.She added that this visit ""represents an opportunity to get to know more about the new Growth Plan, that is, with the new decision that the European Union has made, which is a financial decision to provide six billion euros in aid to the countries of the region."" She stated that 2 billion came as grants, and 4 billion through various types of loans.KriÅ¡to also said that the three key reform laws, which were important and crucial for fulfilling the priorities set before BiH by the European Commission, were almost finished. Von der Leyen said that solving all 14 key priorities, especially the parts that concerned the rule of law, more specifically the law on courts and conflict of interest, was extremely important. She also explained that all countries in the region would have access to financial aid, noting the importance of implementing reforms.The EC president ended her visit to Bosnia and Herzegovina with a ceremony of handing over new apartments to 27 families in VogoÅ¡Ä‡a, who are beneficiaries of the Regional Housing Program, which is mostly (80 percent) financed by the EU. (1 November)Stop dreaming of a 2030 coal phase-out, German finance minister saysBerlin (dpa) – German Finance Minister Christian Lindner has questioned Germany's ability to phase out coal as an energy source by 2030, a goal outlined in the government's coalition deal two years ago. ""As long as it is not clear that energy is available and affordable, we should stop dreaming of a coal phase-out by 2030,"" the minister told the newspaper KÃ¶lner Stadt-Anzeiger in an interview published late on Tuesday.In their coalition agreement, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, the Greens and Lindner's pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) had agreed to ""ideally"" bring forward the country's coal phase-out from 2038 to 2030.""The climate will not profit from sticking to this date anyway, since the CO2 emissions saved in Germany may be additionally generated in Poland, for example, due to European rules,"" said Lindner. He was referring to the European Union emissions trading scheme, which aims to limit emissions in EU member states and allows for the trade in CO2 certificates.The environmental organisation Friends of the Earth Germany, on the other hand, considers the 2030 deadline indispensable for Germany achieving its climate goals. ""The CO2 certificates thus released in Germany must be cancelled so that the emissions do not occur elsewhere in Europe either. Wrong information does not become right just because it is persistently repeated,"" the head of the organisation, Olaf Bandt, said on Wednesday.The 2030 coal phase-out had long been on its way, he said. ""Soon, coal-fired electricity will no longer be needed, due to the enormous market dynamics of renewable energies.""Lindner's statement was also criticised by his coalition partner SPD.""The word 'ideally' is in the coalition agreement for a reason. The goal is not to discuss the date, but the measures we need now to quickly expand renewable energies,"" SPD parliamentary group vice-chairman Matthias Miersch told German daily Rheinische Post.Lindner wants Germany to rely more heavily on domestically sourced natural gas. ""Domestic gas production must be intensified,"" he said, and added that the expansion of renewable energies had to be made possible more quickly.Asked whether Germany needed new gas-fired power plants as a backup option, Lindner said that ""it will come down to that, but the question is how to do it efficiently enough in a market economy, so that electricity prices don't rise further.""For the western German coal region of North Rhine Westphalia, the end-date of 2030 has already been set. However, no such agreement has been reached for the coal fields in the eastern regions of Lusatia and Saxony. (1 November)Croatia is getting closer to the OECD after full integration into the EUParis (HINA) – After a meeting with the Secretary General and the OECD Council in Paris on Monday, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said that he hoped Croatia would join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2026, enabling Zagreb to achieve its last strategic goal. Croatian Ministers of Foreign Affairs Gordan GrliÄ‡ Radman and Finance Minister Marko Primorac also attended the meeting.According to PlenkoviÄ‡, the technical process should be completed by the end of 2025, with the ambition of achieving membership in 2026. Together with Croatia, he said, Bulgaria, Romania, Brazil, Argentina and Peru wanted to realize this goal.The general secretary of the organisation, Mathias Cormann, said that Croatia did not have an entry date yet, but that he expected Zagreb to complete the technical part by the end of 2025.PlenkoviÄ‡ told the OECD Council that joining that organisation, after joining the EU, the Eurozone and Schengen, was the Croatiaâ€™s ""ultimate strategic goal.â€The OECD was created in 1960 as part of the Marshall Plan with the aim of stimulating economic development, and has 38 members today. Most of the countries of the European Union are members of the OECD, with the exception of Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania.The OECD is an elite club that mainly consists of the richest countries in the world. Its program is to increase economic growth and the standard of living of the member countries, contribute to the development of the whole world and expand international trade. The OECD is the last important international institution of which Croatia has not yet become a member. (30 October)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"The future of AI: World leaders talk risks, regulation and collaboration","The G7 agreed on a code of conduct for AI developers. Leaders urged the EU to move faster on lawmaking but pointed out that overregulating may be harmful, especially looking at competition from China and the US. In the UK, political and industry leaders have come together to discuss AI at the worldâ€™s first global AI Safety Summit, committing to collaboration.While the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) raises many hopes, particularly for medicine, its development is seen as largely unchecked. This week, AI took centre stage with the G7â€™s voluntary code of conduct, a trilateral meeting between ministers of France, Germany and Italy in Rome as well as US-president Bidenâ€™s â€œlandmarkâ€ executive order and the international AI summit at Bletchley Park north of London.In late October, the UN also set up an expert panel to make recommendations in the field of artificial intelligence, a technology with ""transformative potential"" yet also great risks to democracy and human rights. Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres called on the panel to race ""against the clock"" and make recommendations on how to govern the use of AI by the end of 2023, identifying the risks it poses and the opportunities it presents.G7: Voluntary Code of Conduct for AI DevelopersOn Monday, the G7 countries (Germany, Canada, the United States, France, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom) agreed on international guiding principles and a code of conduct for companies and institutions that develop artificial intelligence (AI) systems under the Hiroshima AI process. The guidelines aim at mitigating risks derived from this technology such as misinformation and violation of privacy or intellectual property.This roadmap sets out to promote the development of ""safe and reliable"" AI systems internationally and to ""manage their risks"", according to the joint statement, which also calls on all actors in the AI sector to commit to its compliance.The G7 highlights the ""innovative and transformative potential"" of advanced AI systems, and in particular, generative models such as the ChatGPT chatbot, while recognising the need to ""protect individuals, society and the principles shared"", in addition to ""keeping humanity at the center"".""I am pleased to welcome the G7 international Guiding Principles and the voluntary Code of Conduct, reflecting EU values to promote trustworthy AI. I call on AI developers to sign and implement this Code of Conduct as soon as possible,"" EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement. She commented that â€œalready a regulatory frontrunner with the AI Act, the EU is also contributing to AI guardrails and governance at global level.""Robert Habeck, Adolfo Urso and Bruno Le Maire met for a trilateral summit between Germany, Italy and France on digitalisation and artificial intelligence. Photo: Roberto Monaldo/LaPresse/Zuma Press/dpaEU: Excessive regulation harmful to ability to compete globallyGermany, France and Italy want to cooperate more closely on the topic of AI so that Europe can compete more effectively against the US and China. The EU's planned law regulating artificial intelligence must be based on an ""innovation-friendly"" approach, the economy ministers from the EUâ€™s three largest economies said on Monday, while urging more investment in the new technology.After meeting in Rome, the Economy Ministers Robert Habeck, Bruno Le Maire and Enterprise and Made in Italy Minister Adolfo Urso welcomed what would be the world's first law covering AI, expected to be agreed on by the end of the year. But in a joint statement, they said it was ""paramount to ensure that legislation in the EU is designed without unnecessary bureaucracy and that existing red tape is being cut"".The law would regulate AI according to the level of risk: the higher the risk to individuals' rights or health, for example, the greater the systems' obligations.The ministers consistently emphasised that Europe could hold its own at the international level when it comes to AI. Habeck said: ""We don't have to hide. We have companies that are better than the US tech giants in many areas."" At the same time, he urged faster decisions at the European level. ""If it takes a three-and-a-half-year wait, we no longer have a chance,"" he said. ""We will end up regulating a market that no longer exists.""If it takes a three-and-a-half-year wait, we no longer have a chance. We will end up regulating a market that no longer exists.Robert Habeck, German Minister for Economy French Minister Le Maire pointed out that in the US, ten times as much money is currently being invested in AI than in Europe, saying the US invested 50 billion Euro (53 billion dollars) in AI last year, compared to the EU's five billion and China's ten billion Euro. The three ministers called for the simplification of procedures for multi-country projects, to help European start-ups. Italian Minister Urso, who hosted Monday's talks, said AI would be a priority for his country's presidency of the G7 in 2024.In late October, Bulgarian Minister of e-Government Alexander Yolovski also said that the EU should regulate the use of technology, as it poses a high risk to fundamental rights and European values, but it should not engage in over-regulation.In Slovenia, the International Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (IRCAI) under the auspices of UNESCO has been open in Ljubljana since 2020. This summer, the first European Summer School on Artificial Intelligence took place with more than 630 participants from 42 countries.""While small countries might not have as much funds as large players, specialisation and dedication to education and research can lend them a competitive edge in individual fields of AI,"" said Slovenian Digital Transformation Minister Emilija Stojmenova Duh recently.US: â€œLandmarkâ€ order on regulating AI, aim to work with allies on international rulesPresident Joe Biden issued an executive order Monday on regulating artificial intelligence, aiming for the United States to ""lead the way"" in global efforts to manage the technology's risks.The ""landmark"" order directs federal agencies to set new safety standards for AI systems. It also requires developers to share their safety test results and other critical information with the US government, according to a White House statement.Leaders have come together in Bletchley Park for the AI Safety Summit 2023 organised by the British government to discuss the dangers of artificial intelligence. Photo: Soeren Stache/dpaUK: Bletchley Park meeting – â€žbeginningsâ€œ or â€žmissed opportunitiesâ€œ?On Wednesday, countries including the United Kingdom, United States and China agreed the ""need for international action"" as political and tech leaders gathered for the world's first summit on artificial intelligence (AI) safety. UK technology minister Michelle Donelan said the declaration ""really outlines for the first time the world coming together to identify this problem"".The objective of the two-day meeting held at historic Bletchley Park, north of London, where the Nazi-Germany Enigma code was cracked during World War 2, was to find ""an international consensus"" on the challenges presented by AI and how to address them and, for follow-up, it will propose the creation of a global panel of experts to make periodic reports.British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak defended the invitation to China – a country that some accuse of technological espionage – ""because a serious strategy cannot be developed if the global potential"" of the sector is not involved.After the recent trilateral agreement between Italy, Germany and France the Bletchey Park meeting marked ""the beginning of a process of involvement of other continents to achieve what we hope for: a new global alliance, as for the climate, on the rules and protections to be adopted in response to the challenge of artificial intelligence"", Urso noted.However, more than 100 UK and international organisations, experts and campaigners published an open letter Monday to Sunak, branding the summit a ""missed opportunity"" and too tailored towards ""big tech"". The coalition – which includes unions, rights groups like Amnesty International and tech community voices – warned ""communities and workers most affected by AI have been marginalisedâ€œ, with the invites ""selective and limited"".AI beyond the European UnionIn Europe, countries that are not directly involved in regulatory matters such as the EU's AI Act, or in the G7 meeting, are nevertheless taking their own steps to tackle AI.In North Macedonia, for example, at the initiative of the Fund for Innovation and Technology Development (FITD), a working group was formed in September 2021 to create the first National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence. The country will also host the 6th Regional E-commerce Conference in Skopje on November 14, with a focus on the use of AIâ€™s potential. Representatives of companies such as NestlÃ©, Meta, Zalando, Allegro and Reebok, among others, will address the conference. The event is expected to bring together more than 600 entrepreneurs, e-traders, company directors and government representatives from North Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Romania and Serbia.Meanwhile, Albania aims to become part of the European Union's Digital Europe program, which will be implemented until 2027. The Albanian government has already approved the draft law ratifying the agreement between the Republic of Albania and the European Union for participation in the Union's program â€œDigital Europeâ€, which is currently receiving the approval of the committees of the Albanian parliament.For further reading, you can find our last Key Story on AI here.This article is published weekly.

Second Press Pool Trip: enr in Ukraine with Ursula von der Leyen,"Over the last weekend, the European Newsroom (enr) joined European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen once again on her sixth visit to the Ukrainian capital Kyiv since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022. Dpaâ€™s Michael Fischer, Sven KÃ¤uler and Philipp von Ditfurth were on the ground reporting for the enr-pool.The visit came amidst concerns for waning support for Ukraine as the turmoil in the Middle East captures much of the global attention.According to European Commission President von der Leyen, her trip had been planned for a â€œlong timeâ€ and that it was a traditional visit to make before presenting a report on the enlargement of the EU on November 8. Since June 2022, Ukraine has been a candidate country for EU membership.â€œIâ€™m here to discuss Ukraineâ€™s accession path to the EU,â€ von der Leyen wrote on X, formerly Twitter, posting a picture of Zelensky greeting her on arrival at the Kyiv train station. She added that they would also discuss the EUâ€™s â€œfinancial support to rebuild Ukraine as a modern, prosperous democracyâ€. Talks will also include â€œhow we will continue to make Russia pay for its war of aggressionâ€, von der Leyen added. This was the second pool trip for the European Newsroom. This time, the poolers shared text, video and photo material. The shared information was disseminated through the respective wires of the participating agencies.

"No, European leaders have not announced end of euro","The euro common currency is over? That is what an excerpt from a TV news report would lead one to believe. However, the clip, which has been shared nearly 3,000 times on African social media, is not what it appears to be. It was pulled from a 2012 fictional report by French channel M6 -- part of a ""what if?"" series. European leaders have not announced the end of the euro. The viral clip, which was posted to Facebook in late September, came with the caption ""The end of the euro, the return of the franc"", in reference to the former French currency.  ""Good evening everyone and welcome to this special edition on yesterday's announcement of the demise of the euro,"" said M6 news anchor Nathalie Renoux. She continued with a series of questions on ""the end of the common currency"" in Europe, which she said would be answered in the programme.While the report appears genuine at first glance, some Internet users were immediately sceptical: ""We are presented with leaders who are no longer in power. In Germany and Spain in particular,"" one person commented.Indeed, the video contains many outdated details. The Spanish prime minister said to have announced the end of the euro to his countrymen is Mariano Rajoy (seen in the screenshot below), who is no longer the head of government there. He was replaced by Pedro Sanchez in 2018. Screenshot from a Facebook post, done on September 22, 2023Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez makes a joint statement with the Chilean president following their meeting at La Moncloa Palace in Madrid on July 14, 2023. (Photo Javier Soriano / AFP)What is more, the video mentions 17 members of the eurozone, when the euro currency is in fact now used by 20 countries from the European Union (archived here).We searched for the keywords ""M6 end of euro"" on X (formerly Twitter) and came across this tweet (archived here) from January 31, 2012: ""In its next edition, Capital (M6) will get a reaction out of Marine Le Pen to a fake news story on the end of the euro.""Invented news storyA Facebook search using the same keywords led us to a longer version of the viral clip. It was located on the site of the M6 programme Capital, which is devoted to economic matters. The archived edition was reposted on August 19, 2021 and came with the following message: ""Fiction: What will happen if the euro disappears? In 2012, Capital staff attempted to answer this question.""In the programme archives on Facebook, we found a series of six fictional episodes on the question of ""what if France left the eurozone?"" One of them is the viral video. Screenshot from the archives published on the ""Capital"" program page, taken on September 21, 2023  In other words, the report that has been circulating on social media is none other than a simulation, with no relation to reality. France's supposed exit from the eurozone was the subject of debate during the presidential campaign of 2012. The move was supported by Marine Le Pen, who was then head of the National Front party -- now known as National Rally -- and one of the candidates.Quoted in an AFP article from October 2011 (archived here), Le Pen insisted on a return to national currencies and urged devaluation, which she said would perhaps make ""some products more expensive, but more people would have a job enabling them to buy them"". Others also spoke out on the subject. The transcript of a debate held by the Cercle des economistes -- a French economic think tank -- included this quote from Italian economist Elsa Fornero: ""Many economists were saying in 2011 and early 2012 that the chance that the euro would disappear within a year was over 50 percent. I can quote Paul Krugman on this.""It was an outcome that did not materialise. France continues to be a member of the eurozone, which it joined in January 1999 (archived here).In June 2023, on its website devoted to public life, the French state wrote: ""Despite the war in Ukraine, the rise in energy prices and inflation, the euro remained the world's second most used currency in 2022.""Monique NGO MAYAGAll articlesAFP SÃ©nÃ©galAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Croatia supports Germanyâ€™s EU reform plans. Europe to hold a competition to build a space cargo shipSeville (AFP) - The European Space Agency announced Monday it would hold a competition between firms to build a ship to deliver cargo to the International Space Station, in a potential first step towards independent missions carrying astronauts. The ESA's 22 member states, whose space ministers were meeting at a two-day summit in the Spanish city of Seville, also agreed to provide financial support for Europe's long-delayed Ariane 6 rocket.Â  Ariane 6 delays have left the continent without a way to independently blast its missions into space.Â  Europe also faces growing competition from the United States, China and India, as well as private companies such as Elon Musk's SpaceX. ESA chief Josef Aschbacher told the summit that ""a new economy is developing in low Earth orbit that will transform space exploration."" Aschbacher proposed ""a competition between innovative European companies"" to develop a ship that would transport cargo to the ISS by 2028 -- then bring it back to Earth. (November 6)100 Austrian soldiers reinforce EU troops in BosniaVienna/Sarajevo/EU-wide (APA) – Around 100 Austrian army soldiers will reinforce the EU troops in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) from Monday. As the Austrian Ministry of Defence announced on Saturday, the soldiers of fighter battalion 24 from Tyrol and fighter battalion 19 from GÃ¼ssing would complete operational training in the next few weeks. There are currently 292 members of the Austrian Armed Forces involved in the EUFOR Althea mission.â€œAustria is committed to actively participate in managing crises and securing peace in international peace operations, in order to meet the new challenges of the 21st century,â€ said the countryâ€™s Defence Minister Klaudia Tanner.Austrian soldiers in Bosnia and Herzegovina have been under the command of the European Unionâ€™s EUFOR Althea mission since December 2004. Together with their comrades from many other nations, they support compliance with the Dayton Agreement. The main task of the soldiers is to ensure a safe life for the population in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to intervene in the event of domestic conflicts. The commander of the mission is Austrian Major General Helmut Habermayer. (November 4)Croatia supports EU reforms so the union can expandBerlin (HINA) – At a conference on Thursday in Berlin, Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan GrliÄ‡-Radman supported Germany's reform ideas for the European Union to prepare the bloc for further expansion. ""We support the enlargement and we believe that this process can take place in parallel with institutional reforms,"" said Gordan GrliÄ‡-Radman after the ministerial conference entitled ""Bigger, stronger Union"".GrliÄ‡-Radman said that one should think about everything that was limiting and slowing down the development and work of EU institutions, but he pointed out that the most important thing right now was to achieve unity within the EU. ""The priority is unity and solidarity, and the strengthening of those instruments that serve to better defend against threats,"" GrliÄ‡-Radman said.At the conference, the Croatian Foreign Minister advocated the earliest possible opening of EU accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.""We are advocating the opening of accession negotiations as soon as possible, at the beginning of next year at the latest. We are currently waiting for a positive opinion from the European Commission on the progress of the countries of the Western Balkans,"" GrliÄ‡-Radman said. He added that he was sure that the majority of member states were inclined to support the start of negotiations because, as he said, most of the leaders in BiH supported the entry, and BiHâ€™s EU accession was of geopolitical and geostrategic importance for the EU.""The start of negotiations could strengthen the pro-European forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina and speed up the reform processes,"" GrliÄ‡-Radman concluded.

"Excellent progress amid â€œexistential warâ€ in Ukraine, says EU chief","Over the weekend, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen travelled to Kyiv for the sixth time since the beginning of the Russian invasion in February 2022. Reason for her visit to the Ukrainian capital was the countryâ€™s reform progress and its bid for EU membership. The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, denied a stalemate in the war with Russia. An enr pool journalist reported from Kyiv. ""I'm here to discuss Ukraine's accession path to the EU,"" von der Leyen wrote on X, formerly Twitter, posting a picture of Zelensky greeting her on arrival at the Kyiv train station. She added that they would also discuss the EU's ""financial support to rebuild Ukraine as a modern, prosperous democracyâ€. Talks will also include ""how we will continue to make Russia pay for its war of aggressionâ€, von der Leyen added. The visit comes amid concern that support for Ukraine might wane as turmoil in the Middle East currently holds a lot of the global attention. Von der Leyen said that her trip had been planned for a ""long time"" and that it was a traditional visit to make before presenting a report on the enlargement of the EU on November 8.Ukraineâ€™s EU accession: â€œExcellent progressâ€, but further improvement neededToday, the Commission must submit a report on the state of progress made by Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia and decide whether or not to open accession negotiations before the EU-27 meet for an EU summit on December 14 and 15. Enlargement will be at the core of the Brussels meeting.Ukraine has been an official candidate country since June 2022. Unanimous agreement by the 27 EU member states is needed to start membership negotiations. To get a positive vote, the country must have fulfilled seven requirements which include reform of the selection procedure for Ukrainian constitutional judges and a stronger fight against corruption – particularly at  high levels.""I must say you have made excellent progress. This is impressive to see,"" von der Leyen said after a meeting with Zelensky. â€œYou are fighting an existential war, and, at the same time, you are deeply reforming your country. You have reached many milestones: reforming your justice system, curbing the oligarchs' grip, tackling money laundering, and much more.""Von der Leyen affirmed that Ukraine has carried out â€œmore than 90%â€ of the reforms that were requested of it, but recalled that it still must make changes to the minority law to guarantee rights such as for ethnic minorities to receive education in their own language.The Commission president also mentioned that to continue strengthening the transparency of politicians' asset declarations and the fight against corruption and to approve a law on lobbying activities were among the pending issues.According to a statement from the Ukrainian presidential office, bills are already registered in the Verkhovna Rada – the Ukrainian parliament – to improve the functioning of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, reduce the influence of oligarchs and improve the transparency of state institutions.In his press conference with von der Leyen, Zelensky expressed confidence in Ukraine's chances of arriving fully prepared for the final exam and highlighted the motivating effect that a 'yes' from all member states would have on Ukrainian society and soldiers who fight on the frontline â€œfor EU valuesâ€.The flag of the European Union flies on a pole in front of the Building of the Cabinet of Ministers in Kyiv. Since June 2022, Ukraine has been a candidate country to the union. Photo: dpa/European Newsroom EU-Russia: Round 12 of Sanctions, aid package for UkraineRegardless of possible political milestones, both Zelensky and von der Leyen called for continued support to help Ukraine respond to Russian aggression. The EU is currently studying a new series of sanctions against Russia, and a long-term aid package to support Ukraine.The EU has already contributed 83 billion Euro in financial assistance. The Commission president anticipated that a further 3 billion Euro will be forthcoming before the end of the year. She also said that even more funds will be needed, referring to a further 50 billion Euro from an additional plan until 2027 that is backed by almost all 27 EU countries, with only Hungary and Slovakia baulking.Von der Leyen announced on Saturday that the European Union will adopt new economic sanctions on Russia, including measures against companies from non-EU countries that circumvent the sanctions. For too long, many in Europe had thought it was possible to trade with Russia and integrate the country into the European security order, the EU chief said during a speech in the Ukrainian parliament.This new round of punitive measures – which would be the twelfth approved by the EU since the beginning of the war – could include sanctions against Russian propagandists and against figures involved in the mass deportation of Ukrainian minors. Another novelty, according to von der Leyen, could be the introduction of ""new bans on imports and exports"" to and from Russia and ""actions to adjust the cap on the price of gas"", adopted almost a year ago to deny the Kremlin resources with which to finance the aggression against Ukraine.Several high-ranking EU officials reported last week that there are plans to restrict trade in Russian diamonds. Also on the table is an import ban for so-called dual use goods, materials that can be used for both civilian and military purposes. This could include an import ban on aluminium and export restrictions on other goods. The Ukrainians have sometimes discovered microchips in Russian missiles that are normally installed in refrigerators.Numerous punitive measures have long been in place against Russia due to its war against Ukraine. These include a far-reaching ban on imports of crude oil, coal, steel, gold and luxury goods, as well as sanctions against banks and financial institutions.Zelensky has once again asked that the new package serves to prevent the sanctions that have been approved so far from being violated. Ukraine-Russia: No stalemate, no pressure The Ukrainian president denied on Saturday that Ukraine's counter-offensive against Russian forces had hit a stalemate, as hours later Kyiv said it had struck a shipyard in the Moscow-annexed Crimean Peninsula.The sprawling frontline between the two warring sides has barely moved in almost a year, with one senior Ukrainian official warning this week that the conflict was deadlocked.""Time has passed, people are tired... But this is not a stalemate,"" Zelensky told a press conference in Kyiv with EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. Time has passed, people are tired... But this is not a stalemate.Ukrainian President ZelenskyThe Ukrainian leader also denied that Western countries were putting pressure on Kyiv to enter negotiations with Russia, amid reports US and EU officials had discussed what such talks might entail.""No one among our partners is pressuring us to sit down with Russia, talk to it, and give it something,"" he said.This article is published weekly.

Enlarging the EU,"On Wednesday, the European Commission recommended opening formal membership talks with Ukraine and Moldova. This is a major gesture of support for Kyiv as it battles Russia. It also grants candidate status to Georgia and is to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), once conditions are met. But where do the rest of Western Balkan countries stand? Corruption at the highest level, deficits in the rule of law and dubious treatment of national minorities: At the beginning of 2022, it still seemed unthinkable that Ukraine could become a serious candidate for EU membership in the foreseeable future. A good 20 months after the start of the Russian war of aggression against the Eastern European country, it is a different place.The EU Commission presented an eagerly awaited report on the progress of countries with aspirations to join the EU. It assured that Ukraine is ready to negotiate its entry given the reforms it has carried out despite continuing to fight Russia's invasion. According to the report by the EU, Ukraine has completed four of the seven priority reforms that were set.""Today is a historic day,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding that the recommendation comes ten years after the Maidan protests in Ukraine, â€œwhere people were shot because they wrapped themselves in a European flagâ€.https://twitter.com/EU_Commission/status/1722253943223541958The positive signal from the EU provides a vital boost to Ukraine at a difficult time when its troops have failed to make a breakthrough and the West is distracted by turmoil in the Middle East.Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky hailed the move as the ""right step"" for Europe. ""Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defence of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word,"" he posted online.Ukraine launched its bid to become part of the European Union right after Moscow's all-out invasion in February 2022, and was officially named a candidate to join in June of the same year.The EUâ€™s 27 leaders still have to sign off on the recommendations at a summit in December. Von der Leyen said Ukraine and Moldova should be required to complete further reforms before a formal start date could be set. She said her executive would issue an update on the progress in March 2024. Even if Ukraine starts talks, it will still only be at the beginning of a painstaking process of reforms that could last for years – if not decades – before it joins the bloc. Alongside urging progress for Ukraine and Moldova, Brussels also suggested that the member states grant Georgia candidate status. The ex-Soviet states Moldova and Georgia both applied at the same time as Ukraine.What about the Western Balkans?The war in Ukraine has breathed fresh life into the EUâ€™s stalled push to take on new members, as the bloc looks to keep Russian and Chinese influence at bay. For the first time, the Commission presented a report to each aspiring country, and there are ten of them. Namely Turkey, Georgia, Montenegro, Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina plus Ukraine and Moldova.The Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon argued that enlargement to the Western Balkans and the East is not solely in the interest of the EU and new members, but also a geostrategic imperative. ""Europe will be even more stable, secure, and prosperous when the enlargement is completed,"" she said.Turkey began accession talks in 2005, but those are at a dead end. Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are also stuck in negotiations. Bosnia-Herzegovina can hope for the start of EU accession negotiations.Open Doors for BosniaBosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) did not get the unalloyed seal of approval, failing to win clear backing for talks after becoming an EU candidate in December. The commission recommended opening negotiations ""once the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria is achieved"".But the recommendation in favour of Bosnia and Herzegovina in particular is also seen as an important political signal. ""We open the door very wide and we invite Bosnia,"" von der Leyen said. ""Now to go through this door, for that, of course there has to be activity in Bosnia.""The enlargement report says that BiH made progress regarding political criteria as a functional government was established relatively quickly after elections held in 2022. It started to deliver on reforms, including the boosting of legal certainty. However, the actions of the authorities of the entity Republika Srpska which undermine the country's constitutional order are seen as problematic.The message from Brussels was met with different reactions in the country, from optimism to disappointment. The chairwoman of the Council of Ministers, Borjana KriÅ¡to, said that BiH still has the opportunity to make accelerated progress to EU membership. ""This is a significant and strong incentive for all of us in BiH institutions to work faster, better and more in meeting all criteria and priorities,"" said KriÅ¡to. The Chairman of the BiH Presidency, Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡, stated that: â€œNow itâ€™s all up to us!â€ ""We expected an unconditional recommendation for the opening of negotiations and a green light, regardless of all the uncertainties regarding the future of the EU and enlargement, to embark on the real work of organising and conducting negotiations,"" the President of the Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, wrote.The Slovenian member of the Commission, Crisis Management Commissioner Janez LenarÄiÄ, said that since receiving candidate status last year, Bosnia has shown ""the biggest acceleration so far in its reform process"". He is confident that the country can soon reach the required level of compliance with the key priorities needed for the start of negotiations, a decision on which will be made by the Commission in March next year.North Macedonia â€œto pick up the pace on EU-related reformsâ€On Wednesday, Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi called on North Macedonia to pick up on â€œthe pace of EU-related reformsâ€ now that the â€œaccession negotiations process has begunâ€. According to Commissioner VÃ¡rhelyi, some changes to the criminal code have caused concern that they are affecting a number of high-level corruption cases. ""Strengthening the trust in the judiciary and countering corruption, including through solid investigations, prosecution and final judgments in high-level corruption cases is of key importance,"" said VÃ¡rhelyi. Regarding the screening process, the commissioner said the country's authorities have demonstrated a high degree of commitment in its realisation, also when it comes to the relevant constitutional changes.In terms of Bulgariaâ€™s relationship with North Macedonia, Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov said during the European Political Community summit in Granada in October: â€œOur position will not change. If they [North Macedonia] revise their constitution, this will open the door for them"". He was referring to Sofia's insistence on the inclusion of Bulgarian minority rights in North Macedonia's Constitution as a precondition for lifting its veto on the start of EU accession talks with Skopje.Belgrade made constitutional amendmentsVÃ¡rhelyi pointed out that Serbia implemented constitutional amendments for the independence of the judiciary, media laws and fulfilled the requirements for opening another cluster. He also said that Serbia has made progress in aligning its foreign policy with the EU, but that the lack of sanctions against Russia remains a cause for concern. He added that Belgrade and Pristina are invited to engage more constructively in the dialogue and implement the agreed agreements.â€œIt is important for our democracy to see progress everywhere, in the media sphere, but especially regarding to Kosovo and Metohija. Nothing is unexpected in the report, we should not expect revolutionary changes, it is important that we go the European way, and at the same time preserve our national interests,â€ said Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡.Albania moving successfully towards EU integrationAccording to Ursula von der Leyen, Albania is moving successfully towards integration into the European Union, as she said before the Berlin Process summit in October. The Commission president also touched upon the economic development of the country. ""We have laid a good foundation already with our 30 billion Euro Economic and Investment Plan. It is delivering. Half of the Plan, 16 billion Euro, are actually already deployed,â€ she said referring to economies of the Western Balkans and the European Single Market, that are still too far apart. â€œWestern Balkan economies are 35 percent of the EU average,â€ she added.Albania's Prime Minister Edi Rama talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during the Berlin Process - Leaders' Summit in Tirana, Albania, 16 October 2023. The Berlin process, an initiative for high-level cooperation between high official representatives of the Western Balkan countries and the European Union, closely linked to the future enlargement of the block is for the first time since it started in 2014 held in a country that is not part of the EU. Photo EFE/EPA/MALTON DIBRAWhat to expect?Wrapped up with Ukraine's membership push, and those of the other hopefuls, is a far more fundamental debate on how to make the EU manageable if it reaches 30 members or more.Countries such as the Netherlands insist there can be no shortcuts on the road to membership. Hungary, Russia's closest ally in the EU, accuses Kyiv of curbing the rights of ethnic Hungarians.Allowing in a war-shattered nation of more than 40 million people would spell a major shift – and huge costs – for the bloc and will turn some countries currently receiving EU funds into net contributors.Romania for instance wants Moldova and Ukraine to join the EU quickly, but that does not mean ""from today to tomorrow"", President Klaus Iohannis told a joint conference with Belgian Prime Minister Alexander de Croo in Belgium.''We know that these accession negotiations last for years, we know from our own experience and we see well that for some states in the Western Balkans they are already taking a long time. Obviously, we want the negotiations to start quickly. This does not mean accession, it means negotiations and preparation for accession,"" Iohannis said. ""At the same time, I fully agree that the Union must, in turn, make some changes and, if I may repeat what I said at the last informal Council in Granada, not only the candidates must be prepared for accession, but also we, who are already the European Union, must additionally prepare for this accession. It is necessary to improve the procedures, to improve some negotiation procedures and so on. So, there is work on both sides,"" Iohannis added.This article is published weekly.

"Europe in brief: Stricter rules for political advertising, opinions on European security and calls on SpaceX","The Slovenian Interior Minister says security in Europe is being tested and called on Bosnia and Herzegovina to sign an agreement with Frontex. In other news: In the future, personal data may only be used for political advertising if citizens have given their explicit consent. The European Commission has reached a provisional agreement with SpaceX for the launch of four satellites next year.Slovenian Interior Minister Poklukar urges Bosnia to sign deal with Frontex as illegal migration discussedLjubljana (STA) - Interior Minister BoÅ¡tjan Poklukar urged closer bilateral cooperation to fight illegal migration and called on Bosnia to sign an accord with Frontex so that the EU agency could help it protect its borders, as he met Bosnian Minister of Security Nenad NeÅ¡iÄ‡ in Ljubljana on Wednesday. He said that security in Europe is at stake.""This is an important task for Bosnia-Herzegovina in moving towards European standards and EU integration,"" Poklukar said about the agreement with Frontex. NeÅ¡iÄ‡ warned about the complexity of procedures and legislation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, but is nevertheless optimistic the deal could be reached by the end of the year.Speaking after their meeting, Poklukar said that ""security has been put to a test at the moment. Developments in the Middle East are unpredictable and only cooperation between EU and Western Balkan countries can prevent threats in terms of terrorism, radicalisation and the management of illegal migration.""NeÅ¡iÄ‡ said that Bosnia-Herzegovina is not a member of the EU, but the security and stability of the whole of Europe depends on it. He explained that the migration emergency in the Western Balkans was a central topic of his meeting with Poklukar. Both ministers stressed the need to strengthen police cooperation and the exchange of information and operational data between the two ministries and police forces.They thus expressed their wish to set up a videoconference between the police chiefs of the two countries to enhance exchange of information. Poklukar also proposed a meeting of representatives of Slovenia, Italy and Croatia to be held in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. He said that Slovenia will continue to be a close ally of Bosnia on its path to the EU and NATO. ""We are working at all levels to ensure that the European Council takes a decision in December to open accession negotiations with Bosnia,"" he said. (8 November)EU agreement: stricter rules for political advertisingBrussels (dpa) – Political advertising in the EU, for instance on online platforms, will be more strictly regulated in the future. Personal data may then only be used for political advertising if citizens have given their explicit consent, the EU member states and the EU Parliament announced on Tuesday night. Negotiators from both institutions had reached an agreement in principle to this effect. According to the EU states, the final technical details still need to be worked out. In addition, the plenary of the Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers still have to give their approval, but this is considered a formality.According to the new rules, particularly sensitive personal data such as religious affiliation, skin colour or sexual orientation may no longer be used for political advertising. One of the reasons behind this is concern that such advertising could be deliberately misused and actors from third countries could interfere in elections in the EU.The new rules also provide for more transparency. ""Political advertising must be clearly labelled,"" the Parliament announced. It will be easier for citizens, authorities and journalists to obtain information about who is financing political advertising and how much is being paid. In addition, the EU Commission will set up a publicly accessible database in which all online political adverts and the associated information will be stored for up to seven years.The majority of the rules will come into force after a transitional period of 18 months. However, parts could already apply to the upcoming European Parliament elections in the middle of next year. (7 November)European Commission calls on SpaceX to launch satellitesBrussels/Seville (Belga) – The European Commission has reached a provisional agreement with the American space company SpaceX for the launch of four satellites next year. The contract involves an amount of 180 million euros, European Commissioner for Internal Market Thierry Breton confirmed after a meeting of European ministers responsible for space in Seville on Tuesday.SpaceX will put two satellites belonging to the European satellite navigation system Galileo into Earthâ€™s orbit with its Falcon 9 rockets in April and July. Due to delays in the development of the European Ariane 6 rockets, the Commission has to rely on the company owned by Elon Musk, who is also the owner of X, formerly Twitter.The deal draws attention to the ""launch crisis"" in which the European space industry is mired due to delays with the Ariane 6 and Vega-C rockets. On Monday, member states of the European space agency ESA had already decided to release additional subsidies for these rockets, which are supposed to become strategic for Europe's autonomous access to space.To develop new launch vehicles in the longer term, ESA wants to organize more competition. The industry is then supposed to come up with proposals and ESA will step into the role of customer. Director Josef Aschbacher spoke of a â€œparadigm shiftâ€, which would also apply to the development of a spacecraft that can deliver cargo to the International Space Station by 2028. Competition will also play a role here.Breton supported the change of course. â€œThe commercialisation of space activities is a priority,â€ the commissioner said, referring to the ever-increasing international competition. â€œWe need to change our approach to a real risk culture.â€ (7 November)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies.

"This sign is satirical, not linked to any EU-funded project","In order to raise awareness about an abandoned metal structure in the Hungarian capital Budapest, the local chapter of a satirical political party placed a sign on the structure resembling the information boards found at EU-funded projects. The sign claims that the structure is a ""tree stand for hunters with no hunter"" and that it was supposedly built using 134 million forints of EU money. However, the local director of the Two-Tailed Dog Party (MKKP) confirmed to AFP that the sign was placed by them and that it is not a real EU project. There is no sign of any such project in Hungary in the database of EU funded projects. Nevertheless, some internet users believed the sign was another example of what critics call the questionable use of EU funds by the Hungarian government. Many accuse the ruling party of corruption and of diverting the funds to party-affiliated oligarchs and companies.Attila Mesterhazy, former president of the Hungarian Socialist Party, shared a picture of a sign that appears to be an information board for an EU funded project along with the caption: ""The joke here is that there is no joke.. And they are not ashamed"". The post was shared over 1800 times since its publication on November 7, 2023 before it was made unavailable to view.Attila Mesterhazy, former president of the Hungarian Socialist Party, shared a picture of a sign that appears to be an information board for an EU funded project along with the caption: ""The joke here is that there is no joke..

The screenshot was taken on November 8, 2023The picture shows the base of a metal structure, while the board reads: ""Tree stand for hunters with no hunter"". The sign appears to say the structure was built using 134 million forint of EU subsidies.Users commenting under Mesterhazy's post voiced their outrage believing the sign was real. ""This is Fidesz, doesn't even try to keep up the pretence!!!"" wrote one. ""The money went into someone's pocket here too! So easy to live on the people's money!"" wrote someone else. The same picture was also shared by other Facebook users with comments implying that they thought it showed a real EU-funded project, for example here, here and here. Satirical actAFP searched Facebook for other instances using the text on the image. One of the results was a post by the Ujpest chapter of the satirical MKKP party, who are known for guerrilla actions and flash mobs. They also often renovate old bus stops or decorate abandoned or damaged infrastructure in a humorous way.   ""There are a lot of problems that we can't solve on our own -- for example, the demolition of this 30-year-old, rotting billboard,"" reads the Facebook post of the politician from the party's local chapter.""In such cases it is worth behaving like other parties: 1. Find something we can present as a success; 2. Inaugurate it with many politicians; 3. Then take a lot of selfies. That's exactly what happened last night,"" the post reads. DÃ¡vid Nagy from MKKP Ujpest confirmed to AFP that his party put up the sign.""It was an action to raise awareness about the billboard that has been rotting there for 30 years -- but it  [the sign] seems to have been too plausible,"" Nagy wrote in an email on November 7, 2023.The party even created a Facebook event for their action entitled: ""Unveiling ceremony of the tree stand for hunters with no hunter"". It said the event would take place ""near 25 Hajlo Street in Ujpest"" and contained a high definition image of the graphic used for the sign. The out of context picture spreading on social media clearly shows the same sign, albeit with some slight damage after being put up:The misleading post and MKKP's Facebook post about their awareness campaign. The screenshots were taken on November 8, 2023While the poster is identical in every other respect, down to the placement of the staples attaching it to the wooden pole behind, two stickers appear to have been added later. The sticker in the upper right is an MKKP one, it is the one bearing a QR code in this photo gallery shared by the party. Another local chapter of MKKP reposted Mesterhazy's misleading post with the comment: ""Mesterhazy fell for David Nagy from MKKP Ujpest's awareness-raising campaign, he thinks it's a real EU project. Or he is intentionally playing dumb. I don't know which is worse.""The MKKP has parodied similar posters before, but those signs clearly included the party's name.No sign of similar EU projectUsing the location provided in MKKP's Facebook event, AFP managed to find the structure on Google Maps. In Street View mode pictures of the structure can be found from as early as 2012. The metal structure looks old and rusted even on those images.A 2012 Google Street View image of the metal structure. The screenshot was taken on November 8, 2023.When compared to the image circulating on social media, it is clear that it is the same structure, with the same shape and discolouration:The image is in false context and the structure is on Google Street View. The screenshots were taken on November 8, 2023AFP found no record of such a ""tree stand for hunters with no hunter"" in the online database of EU funded projects. The satirical sign mentions the Szechenyi 2020 programme but only three grants related to that programme can be found for the municipality of Ujpest in the relevant database. They have to do with local renovation and climate projects:SzÃ©chenyi 2020 projects, the beneficiary of which was the municipality of Ãšjpest. The screenshot was taken on November 8, 2023 Furthermore the information signs for the Szechenyi 2020 project were regulated by law, as part of which they must include a project number. Such a number is missing from the parody sign.Official documentation governing the information boards required for EU-funded projects. The screenshot was taken on November 8, 2023Real criticism of Hungaryâ€™s EU spendingWhile the EU project in question is satire, there are real concerns about the way EU money is spent in Hungary.According to the Transparency International watchdog, Hungary ranks among the most corrupt countries in the EU. AFP also reported in October 2022 that the European Commission had expressed concern about irregularities in tenders in Hungary and the fact that many tenders had only one bidder. The Commission also complained that conflicts of interest were not properly checked and that there is little legal action against suspected fraud.In September 2022, the Commission proposed that the European Council should suspend 65% of the money Hungary receives under three EU programmes, amounting to roughly 7.5 billion euros, over corruption concerns. Even after a multi-stage negotiation process, the fate of the bulk of this money at the end of 2023 remains uncertain.The EU's anti-fraud office, OLAF, has on several occasions found anomalies in the way EU money is spent in Hungary, for example here and here.OLAF also opened an investigation in 2023 into an EU-funded project in Hungary that gained infamy under the name ""canopy walkway without a canopy"".ZABORSZKY EdeAll articlesAFP HungaryAll articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: European Commission to extend glyphosate usage in the EU,"The European Commission has proposed to renew the authorisation of glyphosate in agriculture for another 10 years. Spain's socialist leader and current Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez says that his country will be a driving force behind the change processes in the EU in the coming years. Jean Asselborn, a veteran of European diplomacy, leaves the stage after 20 years.Brussels to extend the authorisation to sell glyphosate in the EU by 10 yearsBrussels (STA) – After the EU member states again failed to adopt a position on the European Commission's proposal to extend the authorisation for the sale of the herbicide glyphosate in the Union by ten years, Brussels has announced that it will extend the authorisation.The Commission's proposal to extend the authorisation for the sale of glyphosate in the EU until the end of 2033 failed for the second time to receive a qualified majority in a vote by member states – which means support from at least 15 of the 27 member states, which together represent at least 65 percent of the EU's total population. There was also no qualified majority against the proposal.Under EU law, the European Commission must make a final decision by 15 December, when the extension expires. They announced that the authorisation would be extended for ten years, subject to certain conditions and restrictions.Slovenia supported the proposal, as it did in the October vote. As explained by the countryâ€™s Ministry of Agriculture at the time of the first vote, the proposal is in line with the Slovenian government's position.The Slovenian government favours a ban on the use of glyphosate with an appropriate adjustment period for agriculture. According to the government, the sale and use of glyphosate should be limited to the greatest possible extent, and only be allowed in agriculture, where there are currently no suitable alternative methods. Slovenia would regulate the use of glyphosate, they added.

The EU will have to consolidate their technological and scientific leadership on a global scale, tackle challenges such as migration and the consequences of climate change.â€He said that there would also be ""very important debates"", such as the EU enlargement ""towards the Western Balkans, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia"", something that ""responds to a moral duty and a geopolitical interest, that will bring more markets, resources and resilience.â€ SÃ¡nchez added that in the future of the European Union there would also be ""national challenges"", and it would be necessary to ""thoroughly review the functioning of our EU institutions.â€ (16 November)Jean Asselborn, a veteran of European diplomacy, leaves the stageLuxembourg's Foreign Minister Jean Asselborn answers AFP journalists' questions during an interview at the European Union headquarters in Brussels on November 13, 2023.

EU struggles to deliver on military aid promised to Ukraine,"Plans to increase EU spending to help Ukraine defend itself against Russian aggression have stalled because of reluctance at EU level to commit to more funds. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell remains optimistic, saying it is up to member states to mobilise their industries if the EU is to keep its promise to deliver a million rounds of ammunition to Ukraine by next spring.The European Union may fail to meet its objective of delivering one million artillery shells and missiles to Ukraine in the period of one year, which ends in March 2024. This comes despite efforts to increase production capacity and contracts with the arms industry. At a meeting of the blocâ€™s defence ministers on Tuesday, European officials took stock of the military support they have given and pledged to Ukraine to defend itself from the Russian invasion.â€œThe 1-million target will not be reached, we have to assume that,â€ said German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius. The voices that had warned from the outset that the goal was unrealistic were now unfortunately right, he said.""The 1-million target will not be reached, we have to assume that. Unfortunately, the cautionary voices are now right.""Boris Pistorius, Federal Minister of Defence of GermanyThe Union's struggles to make good on promised deliveries come as opposition in the United States Congress has thrown doubt on Washington's ability to sustain supplies. The pessimistic assessment also occurs at a bleak time for Ukraine after its counter-offensive failed to regain territory and as Israel's war with Hamas appears to have diverted attention of its key allies.EU states had previously decided to provide Ukraine with a million howitzer rounds desperately needed to support the country in its defence against Russia. So far, EU nations have only managed to provide 300,000 rounds from their existing stocks.Since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Western countries have delivered a wide range of weapons to Kyiv, depending on the developments on the battlefield. Brussels says that together with EU member states it has organised military support worth 27 billion Euro to Ukraine since the beginning of the war – but a plan to provide guaranteed long-term support for Kyiv has stumbled.Robert Fico, Prime Minister of Slovakia. Photo: Omar Havana/AP/dpaNew aid at EU level appears controversialWhile most of the blocâ€™s member states say they are ready to support Ukraine for the long haul, some countries, like Hungary and Slovakia, have been reluctant to make new financing commitments for Kyiv, thereby stalling the discussions over the EU initiative.In July, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell proposed a new 20 billion Euro defence fund over the next four years to help cover arms deliveries to Ukraine. The plan was part of a broader G7 vow to provide Kyiv with long-term security commitments to help it ward off Russian aggression.Getting the EUâ€™s 27 member states to agree to new aid for Kyiv became more difficult due to the fact that continued financial support for Ukraine had been linked to a legislative proposal for a major overhaul of the EU's long-term budget. The Commission recently asked the 27 states to contribute an extra 66 billion Euro to the common budget, much to the displeasure of some national governments struggling with stagnating economies and tight budgets at home.Germany – which last week said it would double its own funding for Ukraine to eight billion Euro next year – is reluctant to add more money to the EU pot. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said that existing money should be better used before more contributions are demanded from EU members.Hungary, Russiaâ€™s closest ally in the bloc, has expressed scepticism over the plan. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n has said that he is not ready to agree to new money for Ukraine.The new Slovak government led by Robert Fico will no longer provide state-level military aid to Ukraine. Yet, it will respect arms contracts for Ukraine by private companies in Slovakia, Juraj BlanÃ¡r, the countryâ€™s Minister of Foreign and European Affairs, said in Brussels on Monday. Last week, the government blocked a military aid package to Ukraine worth 40.3 million Euro that was planned by the previous administration.European willingness to assist Ukraine remains evidentAlthough plans to spend more money to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia are coming under increasing pressure, the willingness in Europe to support Ukraine and its people – whether through financial, military or other forms of assistance – has not entirely wavered.Regardless of its position on state-level military aid, Slovakiaâ€™s foreign minister also underlined that Slovakia wants to help Ukrainians in the upcoming winter with humanitarian aid and mine clearing. Slovakia also supports Ukraineâ€™s aspirations to become a member of the EU.A new European F-16 training centre was inaugurated in Romania this week, which will primarily train Romanian pilots but will also be open to allied and partner countries, including Ukraine. Under the agreed terms that allowed the centre to open, Romania will provide a military base for training, while the Netherlands will supply the aircraft and the US defence company Lockheed Martin will provide instructors and maintenance. Ukraine is expected to start receiving F-16s from some of its Western allies in 2024.According to Bulgarian Defence Minister Todor Tagarev , Bulgaria guarantees its own security by helping Ukraine. Helping Ukraine even minimally is worth it, the minister stressed, following the Bulgarian Parliamentâ€™s decision on September 27 to approve a resolution on the provision of additional military aid to Ukraine. On Tuesday in Brussels, Tagarev told Bulgarian journalists that the war in Ukraine will likely continue and the EU member states will need to replenish their military inventories, which means that the Bulgarian industry will be receiving orders. North Macedonia's Defence Minister Slavjanka Petrovska said in a TV appearance on November 6 that a new request for additional military aid had arrived from Ukraine, and was currently being reviewed by the General Staff of the Army. â€œIf we get a positive opinion, I will immediately forward the request to the Government, and it will be adopted,â€ Petrovska said, adding that the request from Ukraine is classified. Albania has joined the EUâ€™s sanction package against Russia as part of the reaction to the war in Ukraine. Albania is also part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group (UDCG), represented by its Minister of Defence, Niko Peleshi. UDCG is a US-led initiative that brings together allies and partners from around the world to discuss cooperation and the security challenges arising from the Russian aggression in Ukraine.Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, rings a bell to signal the start of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in the European Council building. Photo: Virginia Mayo/AP/dpaBorrell and Breton: industry capacity is thereWith regard to the promised ammunition, EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton assured the blocâ€™s defence ministers on Tuesday that Brusselsâ€™ plans to encourage arms companies have prepared them to produce the agreed quantity. He also made clear that he believes the bloc would be able to meet the target of being able to produce â€œmore than a millionâ€ shells by next spring.â€œThe industry has the capacity to produce a million projectiles a year, but that does not mean that we will have a million ready by March,â€ Josep Borrell commented, adding that â€œit is up to the member states to pass on the orders for such productionâ€œ. In any case, he stated that the â€œpolitical goalâ€ of reaching one million is â€œambitiousâ€ but that â€œwe continue to strive for itâ€œ.""The industry has the capacity to produce a million projectiles a year, but that does not mean that we will have a million ready by March. It is up to the member states to pass on the orders for such production.""Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyBorrell said a major issue was that European defence firms were exporting about 40 percent of production to other countries. He called on member states to prioritise ammunition exports to Ukraine in order to provide more ammunition more quickly. The question, according to Borrell, is whether the countries, which are the ones that ultimately have to send the material to Kyiv, will organise themselves to order the production in time.The foreign policy chief said countries have placed joint orders for 180,000 more of the 155-millimetre shells, but that figure is due only by the end of next year.Borrell said he would brief European leaders on his work with Ukrainian authorities to push for long-term security guarantees and that he would present a new proposal for security commitments and military aid for Ukraine in December.This article is published weekly.

Posts mislead on popularity of Frexit,"On October 7, 2023, a small French far-right party called The Patriots held a demonstration in Paris, advocating for the country's exit from the European Union and NATO. Between 1,000 and several thousand people took part, depending on the source. In Bulgaria, posts shared thousands of times displayed images of the protest claiming that it proves ""the French people"" want to leave both the EU and NATO. However, this claim is misleading as the images are no evidence that such a sentiment is prevalent in France. While it is true that certain parties in France endorse ""Frexit"" or leaving NATO or its military command, experts and polls consulted by AFP indicate that it is an exaggeration to say that majority of society are in favour. The Facebook post notably states in uppercase letters: ""The French people want out of NATO and out of the EUnion!"" Since it was posted on October 29, 2023, the post has been shared more than 4,900 times and has amassed over 222,000 views. On November 3, 2023, the video was posted on YouTube with the same caption and again by the same Facebook page on November 10, 2023, this time reading: ""This is the video that all Bulgarian media hid! The French want out of NATO and out of the European Union! Not a single media outlet covered it!"" A similar post can also be found on Telegram.But this claim is misleading. Even if euroscepticism is high in France, French advocates of leaving the EU remain a minority in the country, according to polls and experts.Screenshots from posts on Telegram (left) and Facebook sharing misleading information. Taken on November 14, 2023The man who tears the flags is Florian Philippot, the former vice-president of the far-right party National Rally (till 2018 known as National Front) who later left to establish another party, The Patriots, in 2017. In the 2019 European Parliament elections, Philippot's movement garnered only 0.65% of the vote. In the 2022 general election, the party was part of a coalition, but Philippot did not make it to parliament.In the video, Philippot stands on a platform built on a small truck parked at Pont du Carrousel and Quai Voltaire in Paris. He tears down the EU and NATO flags before raising the French flag. The people around him can be heard chanting ""Frexit,"" which refers to the hypothetical scenario of France exiting the European Union, similar to Brexit for the United Kingdom.On October 7, 2023, a video was posted by Philippot's verified Facebook profile showing the scenes we can see after the timecode 00:43 of the misleading video: Philippot and another man tear the EU flag and then raise the French one. The chants of the people and the words of the far-right politician match in both videos.Side-by-side comparison of a still frame of the video shared with the misleading post (left) and the one posted by Philippot's Facebook profile (right)The October 7, 2023 Paris demo was announced on the Facebook page of The Patriots. Around 1,000 people attended, according to police A representative of the Paris police told AFP on November 2, 2023, that 1,000 people participated in the October 7, 2023 demonstration. â€œThere were several thousand of us, in line with our usual numbers over the last few months. But we don't have an exact count,â€ a representative of The Patriots told AFP on November 5, 2023.However, the October 7 rally was relatively small compared to other recent demonstrations or marches in the French capital. According to police, 105,000 people joined the rally against anti-Semitism in Paris on November 12, 2023, and around 15,000 people attended a pro-Palestinian rally in Paris on October 22, 2023. On September 23, 2023, 9,000 people marched against police violence in Paris, according to the French interior ministry. On June 26, 2023, 56,000 people participated in the Paris Pride event, police said.A photograph shows protesters marching against anti-Semitism in Paris on November 12, 2023. ( AFP / Geoffroy VAN DER HASSELT)How popular is Frexit ? ""The French are critical, defiant and sometimes sceptical about the EU's institutions and its ability to function democratically, but there is no existential questioning of the EU,""  Eddy Vautrin-Dumaine, a France representative of the Public Kantar Centre for Europe, told AFP on November 10, 2023. According to its website, this centre brings ""pan-European analysis and opportunity for debate on the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental challenges facing the European Union and its member states."" Kantar conducts the Eurobarometer surveys (here, here) for the EU Commission and the EU Parliament.""When the French are asked whether they think France's membership of the EU is good, a majority think it is. Fifty-four percent think it is a good thing, compared with 15 percent who think it is not a good thing,"" he said. ""When asked if it was important for France to be part of the EU, 58 percent thought it was important. When asked if France would be better off in the future if it were outside the EU, 55 percent think that France would not be better off if it were outside the EU. And 58 percent consider themselves EU citizens,"" Vautrin-Dumaine added.However, ""while there is no desire to leave the EU, nearly one French person in two is dissatisfied with how democracy works within the EU,"" he further explained. ""Only a minority of French people have a good image of the EU and the European Parliament, and they [the French people, ed.] are among the citizens who have the least confidence in the EU. So there is still a certain amount of tension, as well as a lack of understanding and knowledge about the EU,"" he concluded.To understand how widespread the idea of Frexit in France is now, AFP also contacted Christian Lequesne, a professor at the Sciences Po Centre for International Studies in Paris, who deals with topics such as the EU and its future.Asked if it is fair to say that the French population favours Frexit, he replied that that was a â€œhuge exaggerationâ€ and that â€œvery few people think thatâ€.""There are some activists, of course. But they are rather microscopic parties like Francois Asselineau's party [Asselineau is the president of the Popular Republican Union, a small party that claims to be a ""national liberation movement"", ed.] or Florian Philippot's party. But in general, there is very little support for Frexit in France,"" he told AFP on November 1, 2023.He added that within the National Rally (RN), which is popular in Bulgaria, the idea of Frexit is â€œno longer very present (...) The RN is more in favour of reviewing the EU from the inside, for example, by sending MEPs to Parliament.â€Ðžn the left, he points at the far-left France Unbowed: â€œThere are some very eurosceptic speeches about the fact that we need to overhaul the contract completely, but there is no talk of a complete exit from the EU either.â€ France Unbowed leader Jean-Luc Melenchon came third in the presidential election of 2022, and later his block posted a strong performance at the general election.According to Lequesne, the French middle class does not favour Brexit â€œquite simply because leaving the EU could mean destabilising the economy, losing the value of my property, etcâ€. Another reason is that â€œwe've had feedback from Brexit: everything circulated about Brexit and what it meant for the British is pretty negative, especially in France.â€According to a survey published by the US-based think-tank Pew Institute in late October 2023, 57 percent of French people have a favourable opinion of the EU, while 41 percent have an unfavourable one.A photograph taken on March 10, 2022 shows the European Union flag flying under the Arc de Triomphe, on the Place de l'Etoile in Paris, to mark the EU leaders' Versailles summit on March 10 and 11. ( AFP / Ludovic MARIN)Polls: majority of French see NATO as important The post also claims that â€œthe Frenchâ€ want their country to leave NATO. This analysis from the Madrid-based think-tank Real Instituto Elcano, published in February 2022, explains why â€œFranceâ€™s policy vis-a-vis NATO has always been ambivalentâ€.However, according to this survey, published in July 2023 and commissioned by the alliance, 62 percent of French respondents said they want their country to remain in NATO.The latest surveys show that ""a majority of French people would vote to keep their country in NATO in the event of a referendum. Again, there is no desire to leave,"" Vautrin-Dumaine told AFP.Kantar also conducted a study on transatlantic relationships for the German Marshall Fund, published in September 2023. On page 35, we see that almost 70 percent of the French people think that NATO is important for the security of their country.""The French have understood that NATO can play a role in security and protection, so they don't want to leave,"" Vautrin-Dumaine said.â€œIn my opinion, there are slightly more people in France in favour of leaving NATO [than those in favour of leaving EU, ed]â€, Lequesne said, giving as an example the first round of the 2022 election and the program of the far-right Eric Zemmour.â€œThe far-left doesn't like NATO either because theyâ€™re, like Zemmour, anti-American.â€But there are some nuances: during his presidential campaign, Zemmour said he wanted France to withdraw from NATO's integrated military command, as De Gaulle did in 1966. The same for Marine Le Pen.Asked if people who are in favour of leaving NATO could form a small majority, Lequesne said: â€œIt's hard to sayâ€. However, he pointed out that because of the war in Ukraine, positive sentiment towards NATO had grown among the French population: â€œmany French people have realised that if it hadn't been for the massive military aid from the US and NATO, the Ukrainians wouldn't have been able to hold out as they did, even though Ukraine isn't in NATO.â€In April 2022, AFP already debunked claims misrepresenting a video from Corsica as showing a Frexit demo.Rossen BossevAll articlesAFP BulgariaAll articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: Scholz urges Turkey to cooperate with EU on migration,"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has called on Turkey to step up its efforts to take back rejected asylum seekers. European Commissioner Jutta Urpilainen has announced that she will stand in the Finnish presidential election. The European Commission has asked its services to suspend all their advertising campaigns on X.Scholz urges ErdoÄŸan to take back migrantsBerlin (dpa) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan to step up the repatriation of rejected asylum seekers to Turkey. After the two-hour dinner at the Chancellery on Friday evening, government sources stated that Scholz had stressed the need of a ""robust mechanism"" for this. A joint working group was due to present its findings soon.Meanwhile, migration researcher Gerald Knaus, who is considered the architect of the 2016 EU-Turkey deal, has come out in favour of a new migration deal between the European Union and Turkey. ""Germany is the main destination country for those who enter the EU from Turkey,"" he wrote in a guest article published on the website of the German magazine Focus on Saturday. Knaus said that the German government's promise to reduce irregular migration without human rights violations could not be achieved without the cooperation of Turkey.Knaus suggested that Turkey should ""once again declare its willingness to officially and quickly, as of a new cut-off date, take back anyone from Greece and Bulgaria who can receive a fair asylum procedure or protection as a Syrian in Turkey, in order to reduce this irregular migration legally and quickly.""In return, Greece, Germany and other countries should promise Turkey the legal admission of refugees in orderly procedures, as they did in 2016. To this end, the EU must once again make money available for the accommodation of refugees in Turkey and initiate visa facilitation measures for Turkish citizens. (19 November)European Commissioner Jutta Urpilainen announces candidacy for the Finnish presidential electionBrussels (EFE) – On Sunday, European Commissioner for International Partnerships Jutta Urpilainen announced her candidacy for the Finnish presidential election. The campaign begins on 2 December.In a message on her social networking site on X, Urpilainen said she was ""ready"" to become the Social Democrats' candidate for her country's presidential election ""to create hope"", ""to build bridges"" and to leave â€œno one behind.â€ She also announced that she would â€œtour the country by Christmas.â€https://twitter.com/JuttaUrpilainen/status/1726195492819026201The elections to replace the liberal-conservative Sauli Niinisto, who has reached the maximum term of twelve years, are scheduled for 28 January 2024, and a second round in February is not ruled out.Urpilainen is the third member of the European Commission to leave office this year to stand in national elections, after Bulgaria's Mariya Gabriel in May and the Netherlands' Frans Timmermans in August. (19 November)US entrepreneur and owner of X, Elon Musk (Photo Angela Piazza/Corpus Christi Caller-Times via AP/dpa)European Commission suspends advertising campaigns on XBrussels (Belga) – The European Commission has asked its services to suspend all their advertising campaigns on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), due to ""an alarming increase in disinformation and hate speech"" circulating on the social media network, a spokesperson said on Friday.Disinformation and hate speech were seen on multiple online channels, but â€œX is certainly quite affected,â€ the spokesperson said. ""We have therefore advised services to refrain from advertising"" on the platform, the spokesperson added. However, the recommendation does not mean that the Commission is withdrawing from X.Since Elon Musk bought Twitter in late October 2022, the rules around disinformation have been relaxed, the number of staff engaged in content moderation has been sharply reduced and a number of controversial Twitter users made a high-profile comeback – with former US President Donald Trump being the best-known example.Back in October, the Commission opened an investigation into X for possibly spreading ""false information"", ""violent and terrorist content"" and ""hate speech"" in the context of the war between Israel and Hamas. That investigation is part of the application of the still relatively new Digital Services Act (DSA), which imposes stricter rules on online platforms to better protect internet users.The ban on Commission services advertising on X also follows controversy over a campaign by the services of Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson in September. This campaign was suspected of microtargeting recipients on the basis of their political and religious beliefs, in breach of European data protection rules.

She added that the Commission was working on simplifying procedures to make them more accessible.Ivanova was a guest at a round table on issues related to the innovation ecosystem in the Plovdiv region, organised by the Plovdiv Agricultural University.

"EU Climate Commissioner Hoekstra ahead of COP28:Â ""The window of opportunity is closing""","The new European Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra, is gearing up for a tough climate summit at the end of this month in Dubai. The attending countries are nowhere near agreement, and on top of that Hoekstra knows the world is burning too. The European Newsroom talked to him ahead of the COP28.Time is running out on opportunities to limit global warming to a maximum of two or preferably one-and-a-half degrees Celsius, as the world leaders agreed to in Paris eight years ago. The COP28 climate negotiations are taking place at a geopolitically sensitive time, as Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine is still ongoing and Israel is at war with Hamas, among other tensions.The new European Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra, hopes that the United Nations COP28 climate summit in Dubai will serve to give global impetus to the fight against global warming. ""Scientists tell us that much, much more ambition is needed and the window of opportunity is actually closing,"" he stressed in an interview with the European Newsroom.In Dubai, the EU wants to get major CO2 emitters such as China to do more to combat climate change. In return, the EU is willing to help pay for climate damage in poorer parts of the world, for instance.In order to reach a compromise final accord at the COP28 climate conference which starts in Dubai next week, ""we do have an uphill climb that we face, because the ambition simply is very highâ€œ, said Hoekstra.He also said that recent trips to China, the Middle East, Latin America and Africa had shown him the difficulties to overcome. He heard the different countries' formal and informal positions and parsed them to look for a possible ""landing zone"".""In each of these domains – renewables, energy efficiency, methane, carbon markets, phasing out fossil (fuels) –, you know, Iâ€™m always looking for cues, tabling proposals, listening to opinions, trying to reformulate certain positionsâ€œ in order to narrow differences, he said.Loss and Damage fund: â€˜Economic power comes with responsibilityâ€™The EUâ€™s climate commissioner made it clear that he believed China, now boasting the second-biggest economy in the world, should be a contributor, not a beneficiary of the loss and damage fund. ""China made tremendous progress. It is the second economy in the world. It has roughly the same number of electric vehicles as the European Union. (...) With all that affluence and with all that economic power also comes responsibility,"" he said.He added that this â€œis the case for China. It is also for others. Whoever has the ability to pay, should payâ€. The â€œloss and damage [fund] should really be there for those most in needâ€, concluded Hoekstra.The commissioner said the fund should pay out to ""only a limited number of countries, rather than for whoever experiences climate disastersâ€œ. For example, small islands and African states who are not responsible ""for any part of climate change"" and who are ""on the receiving end of droughts, flooding and heavy rains"" should benefit. He noted that the fund ""is not to compensate (for) loss and damage"" as such, only to ensure that a country hit by a climate calamity ""has the ability to continueâ€œ to function.Some countries going to COP28 are even ""a bit iffy on whether it should be called 'loss and damage'"" because of that, though he called such questioning secondary. ""It's just important that we explain what the criteria are for eligibility and what (â€¦) the fund is meant for,"" he said.The loss and damage fund, agreed upon at the last COP, is meant to deliver 100 billion US dollars in aid each year for vulnerable countries to draw on.  Developing countries expect rich industrialised countries in particular to give money. And some are hoping for annual sums worth hundreds of billions. While substantial, the promised money is a fraction of the two trillion US dollars the UN estimates will be needed annually by 2030 to fund efforts to adapt to climate change and related aid for developing countries.Climate Fight â€˜can only succeed with broad consensusâ€™The EU is only responsible for seven percent of global emissions and the climate fight ""can only succeed with a broad consensus"" with countries, large corporations and citizens, said Hoekstra.In a month and a half, the former Dutch foreign minister has travelled to 13 countries besides Belgium, among them Brazil, Chile, Spain and Saudi Arabia, and has held 55 meetings with ministers, special envoys, negotiators and leaders of international organisations.â€œWe need to do much more also in the decade ahead of us making sure that we build bridges to the rest of the world,"" said Hoekstra. The Dutchman has a negotiating mandate under his arm, validated by all 27 EU countries, which includes calls for a tripling of installed renewable energy capacity by 2030, a doubling of the energy efficiency rate and a cap on hydrocarbon subsidies.It also aims to convince the rest of the world, including oil-producing countries, that it is necessary to move away from fossil fuels in general and ""coal in particularâ€œ, he said. ""Coal, amongst fossil fuels, is the one creating the most damage.""Looking at the ""various positions and the various interests countries have"" it is already complicated ""already in a more normal circumstance"". Looking at the last years during which â€œthings have only become infinitely more difficult because of (â€¦) geopolitics"" it would be difficult to meet the target. At the same time, there is no choice but to reach an agreement, Hoekstra says. The planet itself is drawing ""red linesâ€œ, he argues. The high ambitions are dictated by science, Hoekstra stresses. ""And we're unfortunately not nearly there yet."" This version has been edited. In an earlier version, one sentence indicated a quote, although it was indirect speech.

"“Uphill climb” at COP28: Interview with European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra
","One week ahead of 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra spoke to the European Newsroom on the sidelines of the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, France.In an interview with the participating agencies of the European Newsroom (enr) project in Strasbourg on 21 November 2023, European Commissioner for Climate Action Wopke Hoekstra discussed the looming challenges of tackling climate change, the EU's approach and position at the conference, and getting big countries and polluters on board to reduce emissions.Hoekstra acknowledged that the challenges ahead are not easy to solve and that the efforts at the COP28 conference will be an â€œuphill climb (...) because the ambition simply is very high.â€ COP28 will be held in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE) from 30 November to 12 December 2023. More than 70,000 delegates, including heads of state and other world leaders, are expected to attend COP28 to build consensus and facilitate progress on climate action among 197 countries, the EU and thousands of NGOs, businesses, youth groups and other stakeholders.Time is running out to limit global warming to at most 2 and preferably 1.5 degrees, as world leaders agreed in Paris eight years ago. The European Union wants to get big emitters of CO2 like China to do more to combat climate change. In exchange, the EU is willing to help pay for climate damage in poorer parts of the world, for instance.When asked about the responsibility of China, the second biggest economy in the world, in the loss and damage fund, Hoekstra said that  â€œwith all that affluence and with all that economic power also comes responsibility. And that is the case for China. It is also for others.â€The loss and damage fund is the result of an agreement reached at last year's COP27, and is designed to provide financial support to countries dealing with the negative impacts and unavoidable risks of climate change.Several enr agencies, including AFP, APA, BTA, dpa and EFE, attended the interview in person in the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Other agencies attended the interview online.Â Based on the interview, the enr produced a joint Key Story which you can find here.

"EU Mobility and Migration: Aging labour force, unfilled vacancies, brain drain?","While the European Union as well as several member states aim to overhaul their laws on migration, the European Commission has proposed a new skills and talent mobility package in November. It is aiming to combat its workforceâ€™s ageing demographic and is supposed to attract skilled workers from within and outside the bloc. It shall also help curb illegal migration and create legal entry routes into the union.  According to the European Commission, the rate of unfilled vacancies rose to 2.9 percent in 2022 and is more than twice as high as ten years prior. As the population is getting older on average, the number of people of working age in the EU is forecast to fall from 265 million last year to 258 million in 2030.To combat the shortages in the workforce, the European Commission on November 15 unveiled a new proposal which shall also foster legal migration. It aims at matching unfilled vacancies and fields where there is a shortage of applicants with skilled jobseekers, encouraging mobility also for those who are learning.The Commission also made suggestions on how the recognition of qualifications from third countries could be simplified and that, for example, national authorities shall be enabled to speed up procedures by investments in personnel. Information on recruitment and migration procedures in EU countries shall be provided, too.In comparison to most high-income countries, the share of the foreign-born population in the European Union is lower. According to Eurostat and OECD data, the population of the EU has 8.5 percent of foreign-born residents, in contrast to 29.2 percent in Australia or 14.0 percent in the USA.Countries like Slovenia, Bulgaria and Bosnia and Herzegovina are also looking outside their own job markets to fill vacancies. Some are calling for further legislation, pointing out their own experience with labour mobility and skilled workers leaving their domestic labour markets.Participation in the talent pool would be voluntary for member states. The European Parliament and the EU-27 still have to negotiate and approve the proposal. Photo: Mohssen Assanimoghaddam/dpaEU Talent Pool: Matching unfilled vacancies, routes for legal migration On November 15, the Commission proposed the creation of an online platform for job offers in the European Union, the EU Talent Pool, as well as talent partnerships which are tailor-made partnerships with non-EU countries, offering mobility for work or training.The aim is to ensure that people can come to the EU legally to pursue jobs matching their skills and qualifications. Another objective is to open a new front against illegal migration and, therefore, jointly fight against human traffickers.According to the Commission Vice President for our European Way of Life Margaritis Schinas, the starting point of the package ""has to do with the training and work shortages in our markets, which are worrying, since 75 percent of European SMEs [small and medium enterprises] say they cannot find the employees they need.""As an example, he explained that the EU will need 20 million people working in information and communications technologies (ICT) by 2030, but that the EU only has nine million people in this field at the moment. ""We are missing eleven million,"" he added. While not giving a concrete number of possible recruits through the future system, Schinas said the EU would like to ""to have as many [workers] as possible as long as they fit the vacancies.""EU Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson indicated that these proposals are also part of ""comprehensive approach to migrationâ€ with the creation of ""legal pathways"". In this context, she stressed that the EU is going to need more workers in the labour market by 2030 and that for this ""we are going to need more labour immigration"".Â Johansson specified that there are sectors with a ""clear labour shortage in the European Unionâ€, such as construction, the health sector, care for the elderly due to demographic evolution, ICT or transportation.Brussels has identified 42 scarce occupations throughout the EU, which are part of the proposed regulation on the talent pool and which will be adapted according to needs. The pool will also support the implementation of talent partnerships. Jobseekers who have developed their skills within a talent partnership will receive a Talent Partnership Pass, visible to participating employers, certifying their qualifications. Participation for member states would not be legally binding and the European Parliament and the EU member states still have to negotiate and approve the proposal before such a platform can be set up.National approaches and worries to labour shortageIn South-Eastern Europe, some countries are facing both a shortage in the domestic labour force and are also experiencing their own workforcesâ€™ mobility towards more favourable conditions in other EU countries. In Slovenia for example, certain sectors face labour shortages while unemployment is at its lowest since 1991. The pool of former Yugoslav countries, from where the workforce has traditionally come to Slovenia, is emptying. A number of domestic workers, especially along the border with Austria, work abroad due to more favourable working conditions. In September, the amount of EU and third-country workers reached 15 percent of the total working population of just under one million, doubling compared to 2010.Slovenia is looking further afield but for now, the share of workers from third countries excluding former Yugoslav countries is negligible, around one per cent of the total labour force. Slovenian Prime Minister, Robert Golob, stressed at the European Council meeting in Granada in October that the best way to manage migration effectively is through legalisation – because Europe needs labour. Regarding relations with third countries, he called for development aid and migration management to be linked, as the EU has done in its agreement with Tunisia.Bulgaria, who is an EU member but not a member of the border-free Schengen area, implements EU law on the free movement of workers by opening its labour market to EU nationals. Labour and Social Policy Minister, Ivanka Shalapatova, said on October 20, that the Bulgarian government was working on a measure facilitating the import of foreign labour in cases when the possibility to activate Bulgarian citizens is exhausted.Â Between 2018 and 2022, the country has seen a positive trend in the number of residence permits issued for employment purposes to third-country nationals, according to data from the Bulgarian National Statistical Institute. In 2018, the country signed a bilateral agreement with Moldova on the regulation of labour migration. In Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), the increasing departure of young people to the EU has led to a shortage of workforce, especially in the case of occupations with a high demand. Minister of Labor and Social Policy of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Adnan DeliÄ‡, recently announced amendments to the Law on the Employment of Foreigners and the liberalisation of work permits. The goal is to prevent production and the overall business community from suffering losses due to excessive and lengthy administrative procedures in issuing work permits to foreigners.A recent study commissioned by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), two-thirds of companies in BiH expressed interest in hiring migrants. However, representatives of employers in the country say that they do not rely on migrants currently in the country because their goal is to reach the West. According to the Minister of Security of BiH, Nenad NeÅ¡iÄ‡, a significant problem is the arrival of legal migrants in Bosnia and Herzegovina who get employed in the country and then escape to the European Union overnight. He believes that BiH must sign agreements with the countries that send people to work in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ensuring that these individuals cannot go to the EU and must return to their home country after completing their work.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Far-right Eurosceptic leader wins Dutch elections,"Dutch far-right politician Geert Wilders, known for his anti-EU rhetoric, has won a landslide victory in the 2023 Dutch general election. Albanian Finance Minister Ervin Mete said the country will benefit with one billion euros from EU Growth Plan for the Western Balkans. The European Parliament has rejected the Commission's proposal to reduce the use of chemical pesticides.Netherlands stunned as Wilders' far-right party wins surprise victoryThe Hague (EFE) – The sweeping victory of the far-right PVV party of Islamophobic Eurosceptic Geert Wilders has taken the Netherlands by surprise. The country is now facing a puzzle in forming a government, as many parties ruled out negotiating with the far right. However, its number of seats means the PVV cannot be cornered in opposition.At 37, up from 17 in the previous elections in 2021, the PVV won the largest number of seats in the legislative elections. ""The voter has spoken and said: we've had enough!"" the far-right leader noted upon learning the data.The left-wing bloc formed by the social democratic PvdA and the Green GroenLinks (PvdA-GL), led by former European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans, is second by some distance with a total of 25 seats.The right-wing liberal VVD of outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, which is currently led by Dutch-Turkish Dilan YeÅŸilgÃ¶z, suffered an electoral blow in a campaign that promised tough policies on immigration and asylum, dropping 10 seats to 24 MPs.All attention is now focused on the VVD and NSC, two centre-right parties which could sit at the negotiating table with the PVV, although YeÅŸilgÃ¶z said on Wednesday that she did not see herself in a cabinet with Wilders as prime minister.Meanwhile, Wilders said that he would not push through anti-Islamic measures such as banning the Koran or closing Islamic schools (both items of his election manifesto) and promised to ""adhere to the constitution"", in a bid to move forward in the government formation period, which will officially begin this Friday. (22 November)Albania to benefit 1 billion euro from EU Growth Plan for Western BalkansTirana (ATA) – The Albanian Minister of Finance and Economy Ervin Mete stated that Albania would benefit from about 1 billion euros from the European Union's Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, which was announced during the Berlin Process Summit held on October 16 in Tirana.Mete said the aim was to achieve per capita support similar to that received by member states.""To achieve this, it is necessary to implement reforms. The goal articulated in the program of the plan is for us to receive per capita financial support from the EU, in comparable terms to the support received by the member countries. Of course, it is challenging, because we have to carry out a series of reforms. The plan is encouraging and is proceeding with an accelerated schedule,"" he declared. ""A priority reform plan will be conceived, but de facto integration is aimed at before membership,â€ Mete emphasised.""This is a good moment for all the countries of the region. There is an increased sensitivity of the EU. This is also due to geopolitical developments and it will be an impetus for both the government and businesses to be formatted to be a common part of the European market,"" declared Mete. (23 November)Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights: Reconciliation a long way off in former YugoslaviaStrasbourg (FENA) – Almost thirty years after the wars of the 1990s that led to the collapse of the former Yugoslavia, it is high time to achieve effective justice, reparations and truth for the victims, the thematic report of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights Dunja MijatoviÄ‡ highlights.MijatoviÄ‡ points out that close to three decades after the wars that tore the region of the former Yugoslavia apart, time is pressing to achieve effective justice, reparations, and truth for the victims. Reconciliation and social cohesion remain elusive and even peace seems threatened.""There is a visible setback in the process of dealing with the past, which coincides with a more extensive decline in the level of respect for human rights and the rule of law in several countries in the region,"" MijatoviÄ‡ pointed out.A decade after the first Issue Paper on this topic produced by the Office of the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights, this current Issue Paper analyses the achievements and shortcomings of the processes to deal with the past in the region and the factors that stand in the way of a more positive impact.It argues that dealing with a past scarred by gross human rights violations is not a backward-looking endeavour, but rather a necessary condition for a better present and future, based on respect for human rights and the rule of law.In the report, MijatoviÄ‡ recognizes several innovative practices, such as efforts to ensure criminal responsibility for war crimes, solving the issue of missing persons and the role of civil society, which is crucial in supporting the process of dealing with the past through advocacy and innovative projects. The report especially emphasizes the importance of dealing with sexual war crimes and having a gender-sensitive approach. (23 November)European Parliament rejects proposal to halve pesticide use by 2030Strasbourg (STA) – In what is likely to have been the final vote on the proposal in the current legislative period, the European Parliament has rejected the European Commission's proposal to reduce the use of chemical pesticides by 50 percent by 2030.Last June, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal to reduce the overall use and risks of chemical pesticides by 50 percent by 2030. According to Brussels, the new restrictions would have reduced the environmental footprint of the EU food system, protected human health and well-being and helped mitigate the economic losses caused by declining soil health.MEPs amended the Commission's proposal, but ultimately rejected it by 299 votes to 207. At the same time, they rejected an initiative to refer the proposal back to the committee responsible, which is likely to be the end of the road for this legislative proposal during the current mandate.""Today, we celebrate the victory of common sense in the European Parliament, which convincingly took a sensible decision and practically buried the harmful proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of pesticides. It sent a message to the European Commission as well as to the ENVI Committee of the European Parliament and the rapporteur Sarah Wiener, that we MEPs reject it by a majority,"" Slovenian MEP Franc BogoviÄ (EPP) said.

Capturing the moment with your phone: Mobile Journalism Workshop by dpa,"On 27 November, the European Newsroom (enr) hosted its final workshop of 2023. Facilitated by dpa, the one-day workshop revolved around the creation of video and photojournalistic pieces solely produced with smartphones. Seven journalists from enr member agencies participated.Â The best camera is the one you've got with you, explained the two facilitators Kay Nietfeld, senior photographer at dpa and Patrick Neumann, head of education and training at dpa who had travelled to Brussels to deliver the compact, one-day workshop on mobile journalism.Throughout the morning session, the group focussed on videography, starting with a theoretical introduction into shots and frames, examples as well as handy tips and tricks. As a photographer, Kay drew from his professional experience, explaining how he produces video and photo simultaneously. The group then went out to put the learnt theory into practice, shooting a variety of clips which were feedbacked after. â€œNever, never, never zoomâ€, explained Patrick Neumann, as it severely impacts the quality of a digital image.Further, the facilitators showcased different tools to shoot video material with, the ideal settings on the smartphones or various types of microphones which can be used to interview. In a practical exercise, the participants learned about the varying sound quality as well as some doâ€™s and donâ€™ts - such as, standing next to the camera so the interviewee does not look straight into the camera.Seven journalists from participating enr agencies joined the workshop held by Kay Nietfeld (left) and Patrick Neumann (second from the left). Images: European NewsroomThe participating journalists, who had different levels of experience, shared the same sentiment: The production of video and photo is increasingly becoming part of their job. Some participants were photographers by trade while others focused mainly on writing.Throughout the afternoon session, the group focussed on photography. From getting the light just right to basic rules such as the rule of thirds to what makes an image powerful, the facilitators started with a theoretical introduction and explained rules for agency photography.In small groups, the participants were tasked with shooting portraits as well as exploring the surroundings in search of good imagery. Back in the workshop room, the images were analysed in the group setting and participants received feedback on how to improve their photography game.Seven journalists from AFP (France), AGERPRES (Romania), ANSA (Italy), BTA (Bulgaria), dpa (Germany) and TASR (Slovakia) participated in the workshop held at the enr premises at Belga News Agency. ",1
Europe in brief: Manfred Weber to lead German CSU party in 2024 European elections,"The conservative German CSU elects current EPP leader Manfred Weber to lead the party in the 2024 European elections. Belgian and Spanish Prime Ministers Alexander de Croo and Pedro SÃ¡nchez travelled to Israel. The Austrian platform Eversports was one of the winners of the European Commission's #BeActive Awards.German CSU party chooses Weber as European leadership candidateNuremberg (dpa) – The German CSU – a sister party of the Christian Democratic CDU that only operates in the German state of Bavaria – is heading into the 2024 European elections with EPP leader Manfred Weber at the helm and wants to score points with a clear, but also critical pro-European course and a hard line against the far-right AfD party. Weber, who was chosen as the CSU's top candidate on Saturday, and party leader Markus SÃ¶der swore the party in for a tough fight, particularly against the right and populists. At the delegates' meeting in Nuremberg, Weber spoke of Nazis and neo-Nazis, particularly with regard to the AfD – and said they would not allow Europe to be destroyed by them. Both SÃ¶der and Weber described the election as a choice of destiny for the continent.Weber was elected first on the CSU list in Nuremberg with 96 per cent of the vote. The 51-year-old had already stood as the lead candidate in the 2019 European elections – at that time for the entire European People's Party (EPP) as a Christian Democratic party family and the office of Commission President, which he did not end up winning. Since 2022, Weber has also held the EPP party presidency in addition to his position as group leader in the European Parliament.Weber said that prominent AfD politician BjÃ¶rn HÃ¶cke had claimed that this Europe must die and had thus expressed ""what the actual substantial thinking of these Nazis is."" Europe was certainly not perfect, he added. ""But our Europe, which is the most beautiful we have ever had in the history of this continent, the best we have ever had in the history of the continent, we will not let you neo-Nazis destroy it,"" Weber said. He also distanced himself from – in his words – left-wing and green ideologues. Weber described migration policy and securing lasting peace and prosperity as key challenges for Europe. (26 November)Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu receives Belgian and Spanish Prime Ministers Alxander De Croo and Pedro Sanchez. Photo: EFE/EPA/GPO/KOBI GIDEON HANDOUT HANDOUTDe Croo and Sanchez mission triggers diplomatic tensions with IsraelJerusalem (Belga) – The Belgian and Spanish Prime Ministers Alexander de Croo and Pedro SÃ¡nchez travelled to Israel last week for a joint visit. Spain currently holds the Council of the EU presidency and Belgium will take over that post in January. Thereâ€™s no unified European position on the Israel-Hamas conflict, but Spain and Belgium, along with six other EU member states, are on the same page condemning Hamas, while at the same time holding Israel accountable for the many civilian deaths in the Gaza Strip.The Belgian-Spanish duo also conveyed that message to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. The latter chose to start the meeting in the Israeli parliament with a half-hour of gruesome footage of the Hamas attack on Israel on 7 October, after which he wanted to listen to ""the comments.""De Croo condemned the violence after the pictures were shown. He said he knew that Netanyahu would not rest until every hostage was released. At the same time, the Belgian premier wanted to take a moment to address the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, citing the destruction of homes, the internal displacement of 1.4 million persons and the killing of thousands of innocent people.The actual meeting, behind closed doors, went more amicably than expected, according to those who were there. But during a conversation beforehand, in front of cameras, Netanyahu said, among other things, that Israel could not be held to standards that no one had to meet and that the country was in compliance with international law. The Israeli prime minister reasoned that the army had tried by all means to get civilians out of northern Gaza, but that Hamas was keeping them there and using them as human shields.De Crooâ€™s and Sanchez's visit, the initial plans for which predate the formation of the new Spanish government, coincided with the announcement of a humanitarian pause in the fighting between Israel and Hamas. That went into effect on Friday morning and in the meantime has led to the release of 24 hostages, including 13 from Israel, 10 from Thailand and one from the Philippines.That the release took place on Friday afternoon via the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, where only moments before Sanchez and De Croo had held a press conference to call for a smoother influx of humanitarian aid, was unforeseeable. And although the Belgian Prime Minister once again condemned Hamas terror and called for the immediate release of all Israeli hostages, the press conference afterwards led to a diplomatic tailspin with an angry tweet from Israeli Foreign Minister Eli Cohen and a summoned Belgian ambassador. De Croo later spoke to the Belgian press travelling with him of a misunderstanding on the Israeli side and stressed that he had strongly condemned Hamas' actions. (24 November)Austria wins an EU #BeActive Award 2023Brussels (APA) – Austria is one of the winners of the European Commission's #BeActive Awards 2023, which promote initiatives for a healthy and sporty lifestyle. The Eversports platform won the #BeActive Workplace Award with a project that promotes an active lifestyle for employees and a healthy work-life balance.

Posts falsely claim European Parliament photo was doctored,"On November 22, 2023, Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolai Denkov delivered a speech to an almost empty chamber of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. But when he took the floor for his closing remarks, many MEPs took their seats. A photographer from the Bulgarian government's press office captured the moment, and the image of Denkov and the full house was sent out as a press release. The image was later circulated on social media with a red ""Fake"" banner, with claims that the ""neoliberal media"" had altered the photo to make the chamber appear full. AFP consulted the EPâ€™s stream of the session and spoke to MEPs present to confirm that the image showed the tail end of Denkov's speech. Such dynamics are not unusual for the EP chamber, as AFP confirmed by reviewing videos of other heads of state.â€œ... I can't help but notice that our neoliberal press made photo montages of Denkov's speech to the EP, where the whole hall was packed and listened very carefully to his ramblings,â€ aÂ postÂ on a pro-Kremlin Telegram channel reads, sharing the Bulgarian government's photo of Denkov in front of a full house. It also shares another picture showing it almost empty and a YouTube video from the session, claiming that the footage ""clearly shows that there are 15 people in the hall"" and no more.Since November 22, 2023, the post has been viewed over 3,300 times. The same text and photos were also posted on other Telegram channels and Facebook.Screenshots of posts on Facebook (left) and Telegram (right) spreading false informationAfter his speech in Strasbourg, which delivered a clear anti-Kremlin and pro-EU message, his critics targeted Denkov, and the almost empty parliamentary chamber was one of their main points. These critics include far-right politician Kostadin Kostadinov, but also Assim Ademov, an MEP from the conservative GERB party.However, the photo shared by the governmentâ€™s press office was not doctored. Those social media claims are false.Denkov at the EP On November 22, 2023, Nikolay Denkov took part in an event entitled â€œThis is Europe"".The EP website describes â€œThis is Europeâ€ as events featuring EU heads of state and government with â€œexchanges and discussions focus[ing] on EU actionsâ€.AFP reviewed the stream (archived here) from the session featuring the Bulgarian PM to find out what happened in the EP chamber in Strasbourg. At 10:50 (which corresponds to the time of day), Denkov enters the chamber alongside EP President, Roberta Metsola, who presents him. At 10:53, the Bulgarian PM takes the floor and speaks for the next 22 minutes with cameras showing the relatively empty parliament a couple of times:Screenshot from the first part of Denkovâ€™s speech. Taken on November 23, 2023Screenshot from the first part of Denkovâ€™s speech. Taken on November 23, 2023Over the next 50 minutes, different MEPs make their speeches, with Bulgarian MEP Ivo Hristov the last to speak. As we can see during his speech, the chamber is already full of deputies:Screenshot showing the last MEP to speak before closing remarks.Taken on November 23, 2023After 12:09, Denkov retakes the floor for final remarks, and Metsola asks for silence.

AFP found the photo and press release on the government's website and contacted GIS to get more information about their decision to use the picture.A comparison of a still shot from the stream from this part of the session and the photo sent by GIS gives many matches which confirm that the latter depicts the same event and was not doctored to add audience:A photo submitted by GIS that is being misrepresented as a photo montage.

Annotations made by AFP on November 27, 2023Contacted by AFP, GIS replied by email on November 23, 2023 that the government photographer took their photo. As for why the press service decided to use a photo from Denkovâ€™s final remarks, GIS replied: â€œIt was taken at the time of the Prime Minister's closing speech to MEPs, and the relevant press release refers to that part of the Prime Minister's words.â€The government's press release does in fact start with a quote from Denkovâ€™s closing remarks regarding the rule of law.Similar dynamics during other EP speeches According to the EP's session schedule for November 22, voting had been scheduled for 12pm. At that time, Denkov was still speaking.â€œThe photo was taken at the end of the discussion when the room was full,"" Bulgarian MEP Radan Kanev (his party, DSB, supports Denkov's government), who was present during the session, told AFP on November 23, 2023. He added that having a full room in the final part of the discussion was common.""During the big opening speech of the Bulgarian prime minister, the hall was empty, except for the praesidium, the Bulgarian MEPs and several MEPs, representatives of different political groups,â€ Elena Yoncheva, another Bulgarian MEP (her party, BSP, does not support Denkov's government) present during the discussion, told AFP through her press office on November 23, 2023. â€œIt must be said, however, that when prime ministers speak, the Chamber of the European Parliament is almost never full,â€ she said, adding that ""at 12 o'clock, all MEPs entered the Chamber for the vote, which coincided with the Prime Minister's closing speech"".To see if what happened during Denkov's speech was unusual, AFP also consulted sessions with other leaders from the â€œThis is Europeâ€ debates.On May 9, 2023, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz took part in the debates. As we can see from the still shots, there are fewer people at the beginning of the debate than during Scholz's closing remarks. According to the EPâ€™s May 9, 2023 agenda, voting was scheduled for 12:00, but Scholz's speech continued until 12:19.Comparison of screenshots from the beginning of Scholtzâ€™s speech (left) and his closing remarks (right). Taken on November 24, 2023.On April 19, 2023, Luxembourgâ€™s Prime Minister Xavier Bettel addressed MEPs. Again, there was voting scheduled for 12:00, and Bettel was still wrapping up his closing remarks at that time, meaning that he too started in front of a relatively empty parliament and finished among a much fuller house.Comparison of screenshots from the beginning of Bettel's speech (left) and his closing remarks (right). Taken on November 24, 2023.Similar dynamics can be observed with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis's speech on July 5, 2022 (again, votes were scheduled for 12:00, just after his speech):Comparision of screenshots from the beginning of Mitsotakis' speech (left) and his closing remarks (right).

Taken on November 24, 2023.Similarly, the MEPs entered the chamber when Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob made his final remarks during the ""This is Europe"" debate on December 13, 2022. ""Madam President, dear Members of the Parliament, Iâ€™m glad to be here again now. I have a bigger audience now. You obviously enjoyed my previous speech so much, you came to listen, all of you,"" he said. This ""This is Europe"" debate with Golob was again scheduled from 10:30 to 12:00, with votes scheduled for just after.""It is customary to have these debates in prominent place on the agenda but there is no fixed slot,"" Emilie Tournier , a press officer for the EP, told AFP in an email received on November 24, 2023.She gave as an example ""the debate in the mini-plenary in Brussels with Croatiaâ€™s Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic"". This debate took place in Brussels in the afternoon of June 22, 2022, and there was no voting scheduled after it. The hall was not full at the beginning of his intervention or at its end.""Members of the European Parliaments (MEPs) organise the exercise of their free mandate themselves, their presence in the hemicycle can vary as they might have concurring activities in parallel to the plenary debates,"" Tournier said, adding that ""during the debate [with Denkov, ed.] all representation of the groups/political family were present"".Regarding the influx of MEPs after 12:00, Tournier commented that ""members are invited to be present for the voting session that starts around 11.30 or 12.00 depending on the agenda approved by the plenary"".Rossen BossevAll articlesAFP BulgariaAll articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

How Green is South-East Europe?,"Green movements are on the rise in the Western Balkans and the broader area. Do they have a chance of success and will they be able to play a role in the regionâ€™s environmental future?In contrast to Europe's North-West, the green parties and movements in South-East Europe tend to achieve weaker election results than their counterparts. It seems to be more difficult to mobilise voters in South-East Europe around environmental issues. Nevertheless, awareness for climate matters is on the rise.In 2020, the countries of the Western Balkans signed the Declaration on the Green Agenda at the summit in Sofia, Bulgaria. With this, they committed themselves to completely phase out coal by 2050 as part of the European Green Deal to become climate-neutral by then.German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock – who is a member of the countryâ€™s Green Party – also called on the group of countries in the Western Balkans to cooperate more on energy security and the switch to renewable energies. Russia is using energy as a weapon, she said. ""Getting this green transition on track is in our common interest because we all benefit from clean and secure energy,"" she said in her opening speech at the Western Balkans Conference in Berlin on October 21.Bosnia and Herzegovina: Growing environmental awareness but lack of political willAs an active member of the Energy Community, which brings the EU and many of its neighbours in Balkans and Black Sea regions together, Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) committed itself to the reform of the energy sector and the harmonisation of its policies with EU members. But it has not done much in this regard so far as only three percent of its produced energy comes from renewable sources compared to 60 percent of energy coming from coal last year. BiH is hence being criticised by the Energy Community, because decarbonisation is one of the conditions for EU integration.With only one document outlining the strategic framework of energy transition, the key problem is the lack of political will. BiHâ€™s green parties and other parties nominally focus on environmental issues, but not enough to successfully differentiate themselves from other parties.Nevertheless, environmental awareness is growing and the citizens are increasingly engaging in the fight for environmental protection at a local level. The Green Party of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was only founded in March, won one mandate in the Assembly of the Republika Srpska (RS).North Macedonia: ""Sign against the mine of death""Out of 60 or so registered political parties, North Macedonia only has one declared green party – the Democratic Renewal of Macedonia, short: DOM – which has one seat in the Assembly. In spite of that, the country witnessed a number of environmental actions and protests in recent years.One of the most prominent cases was the protest against the opening of the gold and copper mine ""Ilovica-Shtuka"". In mid-August this year, activists started collecting signatures on petitions against the opening of the mine under the slogan ""Sign against the mine of death"".In 2014, two concessions were granted to the Canadian corporation Euromax Resources. After years of environmental protests, the new government cancelled one of the concessions and unilaterally terminated the contract in December 2019, saying that the company did not provide the necessary documentation. The court decided in favour of Euromax Resources against the government's decision in March 2023. In June 2023, the government decided to merge two concessions for the mine into one. According to the Ministry of Economy, the court rulings may result in new lawsuits and proceedings in front of international courts, which could seriously damage the budget. However, the government withdrew from the decision to merge two concessions into one after all 20 days later.On a local level, an independent list of activists and NGOs for the protection of the environment and human and animal rights appeared under the name ""Green Humane City"" (ZHG) and won two seats in Skopjeâ€™s City Council in 2021. In the past two years, ZHG has provided more funds for the processing of plastic waste, for mapping air pollution, for composting organic waste as well as the welfare of stray animals among other things.Europeâ€™s last wild river: The Wild River National Park in AlbaniaEarlier this year, in March 2023, the Albanian Vjosa River was declared the first Wild River National Park in Europe after a decade-long campaign. The campaign to protect it was broadly supported by civil society and the private sector as well as Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio, an outspoken advocate for environmental issues.There are further campaigns to protect other Albanian natural habitats such as the Narta Lagoon and the Karavasta Lagoon. Those projects are largely supported by foreign partner organisations as well as embassies such as the Delegation of the European Union. The countryâ€™s government also declared environmental protection a national priority.Also worth mentioning is the ""Plant a tree"" campaign of the Municipality of Tirana, the Albanian capital. The city council announced that it planted about one million new trees as part of the Orbital Forest initiative around the capital.â€˜Green policies have taken a back seatâ€™ in Bulgaria, warns the Green MovementIn an interview on November 21, Bulgarian Green Movement co-leaders Daniela Bozhinova and Toma Belev said that in the name of bigger goals for Bulgaria such as joining the Euro area and Schengen, green policies have taken a back seat. The Green Movement is part of the Democratic Bulgaria coalition and the larger power-sharing coalition Continue the Change - Democratic Bulgaria, and has four seats in parliament. Bozhinova and Belev noted that their party is unequally represented in the group and requested a co-leading position within Democratic Bulgaria in order to bring green policies back to the forefront. The Green Movement is part of the European Green Party and plans to run in the European parliamentary elections in 2024, aiming to have one MEP elected. In the current parliament, the party was successful in preventing the plundering of forests by rejecting a bill that would have allowed a large amount of timber to be taken out of state communal forests.The Green Movement party came to prominence during the short eight-month government of Kiril Petkov (December 13, 2021 – August 2, 2022), when their co-leader Borislav Sandov was Minister of the Environment. During this time, the government enforced strict environmental legislation, penalised polluters and designated new protected areas.Bulgaria's prominent environmental movement Ecoglasnost played a crucial role in the fall of the communist regime in the country. A rally by the movement on November 3, 1989, in Sofia, became the first demonstration against the totalitarian rule of Todor Zhivkov. Activists were against the construction of hydroelectric power generation projects on the rivers Rila and Mesta and voiced demands for public reforms. The communist party ousted Zhivkov on November 10, 1989. Romania investing in recyclingIn neighbouring Romania, one of the most recent initiatives at the government level is the recycling project deposit-return system (SGR). Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu said it will be the second largest in Europe, after Germany, in terms of the number of packaging processed, starting as of November 30.""The establishment of the RetuRo collection centres will create more than 600 jobs by the end of next year and will stimulate similar investments in transport and recycling both horizontally and vertically,"" said Ciolacu. RetuRO Sistem Garantie Returnare SA is a ""not-for-profit"" company, meaning that any earnings made from the collection of beverage packaging will be reinvested exclusively in the development of the waste-return-system.While there are no environmental political parties in power in Romania, there are numerous organisations promoting a healthy and ecologically balanced environment. Among the around ten parties that are registered to follow a ""green doctrineâ€œ, the Green Party, which is a member of the European Greens, is enjoying popularity at the national level.We Can: Croatiaâ€™s rising Green movementIn Croatia, which is an EU member since 2013, the green coalition under the political platform ""MoÅ¾emo!"" (We Can!) won 116,000 votes and thus seven seats in parliament in the last parliamentary elections in 2020. In comparison, just a year earlier in the 2019 EU elections, the same platform received less than 20,000 votes. In other words, only 1.8 percent of voters had cast their ballot for them. In the local elections in May 2021, one of the leaders of the ""MoÅ¾emo!"" platform, Tomislav TomaÅ¡eviÄ‡, was elected mayor of Zagreb. A new test for him and his platform will be the upcoming parliamentary and European elections, which will take place next year.This article has been updated to correct spelling.This article is published weekly.

COP28: EU commits to phasing out fossil fuels and tripling renewables,"As world leaders prepare for the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28), Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres urged them to step up efforts to mitigate the negative effects of global warming. In this context, the EU is committed to ensuring that world leaders agree to phase out fossil fuels and rapidly increase the production of renewable energy.UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres has called on the global community to break out of the ""deadly cycle"" of global warming and melting ice at the poles prior to the upcoming COP28 climate summit in Dubai, which starts this Thursday. ""Leaders must act to limit global temperature rise to one-and-a-half degrees Celsius, protect people from climate chaos, and end the fossil fuel age,"" Guterres told journalists in New York on Monday.The summit is marked by the controversy that the host responsible for setting the agenda is the United Arab Emirates. The summitâ€™s President-Designate is Sultan al Jaber, who is also the countryâ€™s industry minister and head of the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC).In Dubai, a first assessment will be made of the progress achieved by countries towards the goals set by the 2015 Paris Agreement and future action. In that agreement, the international community agreed to limit global warming to less than two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels, or even one-and-a-half degrees if possible.The target was agreed in order to avoid exceeding dangerous tipping points with irreversible consequences and avert the most catastrophic consequences of climate change. However, according to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) the planet is currently heading towards a world that is almost three degrees warmer.Therefore, the stakes of the conference are high: agreeing on a phase-out of fossil fuels and ensuring sufficient financing for a just transition are important items on the agenda. As are efforts to try and keep the scientifically recommended global warming target ""alive"" in a context of growing mistrust in government commitments and between rich countries and the global South.""We know that 2023 will be the warmest year on record and that we have even surpassed the target of two degrees Celsius of global warming. We simply need to do more,"" said Tina KobilÅ¡ek from the Slovenian Ministry of the Environment and Sloveniaâ€™s chief negotiator.Wind turbines are in operation near Euskirchen and supply electricity. Photo: Roberto Pfeil/dpaFrom fossil fuels to renewablesAccording to the EU Councilâ€™s conclusions prior to COP28, the EU will work to ensure that the final agreement at COP28 includes an end to the production and consumption of all fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) for energy use, together with targets to triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency.With regard to the dates being considered for the end of fossil fuels, sources from the Spanish Presidency of the EU have said that they are taking the arguments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the International Energy Agency as a reference. They speak of a 2030 horizon for electricity and a 2050 horizon for the entire energy sector.â€œWithout phasing out fossil fuels, we will not be able to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and keep a one-and-a-half degree world within reach,â€œ said Jennifer Morgan, Climate Protection Commissioner at the German Foreign Office. It said in a statement that the government ""will work with the European Union to call for the expansion of renewable energiesâ€œ.The goals of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and increasing the production of renewable energy are in line with the UNâ€™s 15-year global framework, centred on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). EU members and candidates alike are pushing domestically for changes – often with support from Brussels.European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, Iliana Ivanova, said that Bulgariaâ€™s Hydrogen Valley, for example, is among the nine EU-wide projects selected for funding by the Clean Hydrogen Partnership. Located near Stara Zagora, it aims to produce at least 500 tonnes of hydrogen a year. The EU is funding it with a grant of eight million Euro. The project coincides with the research and innovation approach as outlined in the EUâ€™s hydrogen strategy, REPowerEU and the upcoming Hydrogen Valley Roadmap.Romania's President Klaus Iohannis will support the need to urgently implement the commitments already made to combat climate change. He will also stress the importance of climate and environmental education in the Romanian education system. At the same time, at COP28 he will highlight Romaniaâ€™s ambition to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and its openness to cooperation in a multilateral framework on issues relevant to the country's climate diplomacy.On November 20, the Albanian parliament approved with 73 votes the changes in a national taxÂ  law that also provides for the increase of the carbon tax for coal and some of its by-products. The decision is related to the decarbonisation approach, in line with the green policies of the European Union. Albania is also part of the 192 UN member states that have approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its government is also engaged in the continuation of plans and projects to make the Sustainable Development Goals a reality.Wopke Hoekstra, European Commissioner for Climate Action, speaks to journalists. Photo: Ng Han Guan/AP/dpaLoss and Damage Fund back on the tableAlthough sending a clear message on mitigation will be the most important battle of this yearâ€™s COP28 summit, it will not be the only one – for a balanced outcome it will also be necessary to make progress on solidarity, especially in relation to the new Loss and Damage Fund. The instrument, designed to compensate for the losses and damage caused by global warming in the poorest countries, was agreed on last year at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh.Last yearâ€™s negotiations between rich and developing countries led to a compromise. The instrument will remain with the World Bank for four years, a solution unwelcome to the poorest countries. The final decision is to be taken in Dubai, and a tough battle between North and South is expected.The Loss and Damage Fund is meant to deliver 100 billion US dollars in aid each year for vulnerable countries to draw on. Developing countries expect rich industrialised countries in particular to give money – some are hoping for annual sums worth hundreds of billions. While substantial, the promised money is a fraction of the two trillion US dollars the UN estimates will be needed annually by 2030 to fund efforts to adapt to climate change and related aid for developing countries.European Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra, who will negotiate at COP28 on behalf of the EU, made it clear that he believed China should be a contributor, not a beneficiary of the Loss and Damage fund. â€œChina made tremendous progress. It is the second largest economy in the world. It has roughly the same number of electric vehicles as the European Union. (â€¦) With all that affluence and with all that economic power also comes responsibility,â€ he said.A recent agreement between the United States and China on climate collaboration bodes well for the possibility of increasing global efforts against climate change. In particular, agreements to triple renewables by 2030 and to increase support for adaptation are being sought at COP28. The increase in renewables (along with the commitment to cut methane leakage) is the highlight of the US-China agreement, and could involve other powers.COP29 presidency up for grabs?The COP summits typically rotate between five regional groups. The major issue of which country will host COP29 in 2024 is already facing diplomats ahead of COP28. Currently, the presidency for next yearâ€™s conference is earmarked for Eastern Europe.Bulgaria bid for the honour but its bid was blocked by Russia. Bulgariaâ€™s Environment Minister Yulian Popov told POLITICO that Russiaâ€™s line of reasoning â€œis that they donâ€™t believe that Bulgaria or any other EU country will be impartial in running COP29â€. According to him, Russiaâ€™s hidden argument is that it is ""being blocked by EU countries about various things in relation to the war against Ukraineâ€œ, and thus it strikes back.Apart from Bulgaria, Armenia and Azerbaijan have offered to host, but both are hindering each other over the ongoing Nagorno Karabakh conflict; Russia is blocking Bulgaria and the Czech Republic because they are EU countries, but is supporting Belarus.The 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference begins in Dubai on November 30 and will run until December 12. It is expected to attract 70,000 participants from 197 countries.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Europe in brief: Commission approves aid for Slovenia following August floods,"The European Commission has approved Slovenia's request for aid to help with the reconstruction and rehabilitation of the country following the floods in August. Schengen enlargement will not be discussed during the Justice and Home Affairs Council in December. Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launches a global alliance to combat migrant smugglers.Slovenia receives 100 million euros from EU Solidarity Fund to tackle consequences of floodsBrussels/Ljubljana (STA) – The European Commission has approved an advance of 100 million euros from the EU Solidarity Fund for the reconstruction of Slovenia following the August floods. The countryâ€™s Minister for Cohesion and Regional Development Aleksander JevÅ¡ek described this as very good news.As the Commission explained, the EU Solidarity Fund would be used for the recovery and reconstruction after the August floods, including the rehabilitation of critical infrastructure, the implementation of measures to protect cultural heritage affected by the storm, the clean-up of the affected areas and intervention costs.""This is very good news, especially for those who suffered the most damage during the floods and for those of us who were preparing the Solidarity Fund application, which had to be done in a relatively short time,"" said JevÅ¡ek.Slovenia sent its application to Brussels on 20 October. While the advance payment does not require the approval of the EU Council and the European Parliament, it will need to be approved before the expected additional 300 million euros can be disbursed. The government was expecting a decision in March or April, the minister said.Elisa Ferreira, European Commissioner for Cohesion, stressed that the EU stood by Slovenia. This is a ""testament to the fact that this advance payment of 100 million euros is the maximum mobilised to date under the EUSF,"" she said.

Photo: AgerpresSchengen enlargement not on the agenda at JHA Council on 4-5 DecemberBucharest (Agerpres) – Schengen enlargement was not going to be discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in early December, because the Netherlands had not officially expressed its position on Bulgaria after the recent elections, Romanian Interior Minister CÄƒtÄƒlin Predoiu said.""The Dutch government, which had a position on Bulgaria last year, is to take a position in parliament and parliament is to decide on the matter. This procedure in the Dutch Parliament coincides with the date of the JHA Council. It is impossible to discuss the issue in the JHA Council on 4-5 December until the Dutch government has clarified its position on Bulgaria,"" explained Predoiu. He did not rule out that the issue could be put on the agenda of another JHA meeting in December.At the same time, Predoiu stressed that over the last year ""Romania has achieved a remarkable performance"" in terms of border protection. ""All the figures of illegal migration have decreased, at all borders, especially at the western border, where it was a problem. The border with Serbia has seen a decrease in illegal migration figures by up to 90 percent.""In this context, the minister said that ""there is no longer any official position of any European member state that questions Romania's performance in fighting illegal migration and protecting the border."" (29 November)EU crackdown on migrant smugglers, Von der Leyen launches Global Alliance - Photo by Sakis MITROLIDIS / AFPEU clamps down on migrant smugglers, Von der Leyen launches global allianceBrussels (ANSA) – The European Commission has launched a new crackdown on migrant smugglers to further strengthen the surveillance of external borders. The underlying strategy still is to primarily stop irregular flows at the source and, secondarily, to prevent entries. Brussels and Rome seem to be in full agreement regarding this strategy, and it constitutes the framework for the international conference for the Global Alliance against Traffickers convened in the Belgian capital.""We have to build a systemic response,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, adding that â€œwe also need a Global Allianceâ€ against traffickers. She said that the best way to save lives was to prevent these people from embarking on the journey. According to her, this requires close cooperation with international agencies and, above all, partnerships with third countries.The summit had been announced by the President of the Commission in her State of the Union address. Representatives from 57 countries arrived in the Belgian capital this week: from Europe to South-East Asia, from North Africa (although the Tunisian minister was absent) to the Balkans.

EU watchdog did not call Covid vaccination 'illegal',"The European Medicines Agency (EMA), an EU body that monitors pharmaceutical safety, approved Covid vaccines in late 2020. During a press conference in Strasbourg in November 2023, a member of the European Parliament claimed that the EMA had just admitted that mass vaccination had been ""illegal"" because the jabs had only been authorised for ""personal protection"" and not for preventing transmission from one person to another. The claim was shared hundreds of times on social media in various languages. It is however false. The EMA had indeed authorised the vaccine for protecting the vaccinated individuals only, but that did not make mass vaccinations illegal. We also know more now about the effectiveness of Covid vaccines at preventing transmission compared to when they were first introduced in 2020.Facing the camera and standing against a backdrop with the European Parliament logo, Dutch MEP Marcel de Graaff explained that he had written to the EMA to ask the agency ""to withdraw the market admission"" of Covid vaccines. ""This month, we received an answer from the EMA to our letter, and this answer contains shocking facts,"" de Graaff continued.The MEP is a member of the Forum for Democracy, a conservative and eurosceptic Dutch political party. Until late 2022, he belonged to the far-right Identity and Democracy political group of the European Parliament. He quit over what he called its ""anti-Russia"" stance and is now without a political group in the European Parliament.During the press conference on vaccines and the EMA -- which was held on November 21 -- de Graaff said: ""The EMA explicitly states that it has exclusively allowed the corona vaccines on the market for individual immunisations and absolutely not for the control of infection... This is devastating for governments that have gone all in with the message that you are doing it for someone else.""He added that according to the EMA letter, ""no one under the age of 60 should have been vaccinated, with only a few exceptions"". Others at the press conference spoke of ""bad batches"" of vaccines and adverse side-effects allegedly left unmentioned by government authorities. The video of the press conference posted to YouTube has been viewed more than 100,000 times. The footage has also been shared on social media in various languages, including Dutch, French, German and Bulgarian. In France, the video went viral on X where Silvano Trotta, who is known to spread Covid disinformation, claimed: ""The European Medicines Agency thus confirmed that the 'compulsory vaccine' against Covid-19 was an illegal off-label use."" His post, which included a photo of the EMA letter, has been retweeted more than 900 times. Someone else wrote: ""'No one under the age of 60 should have been vaccinated...' Vaccine: people are beginning to talk, it's going to hurt!!!  The European Medicines Agency has just set everyone free"". The November 23 tweet has been shared more than 300 times. Another video on the same subject has also been circulating on social media. It is an interview de Graaf gave to the website ""The Epoch Times"", which is known to spread disinformation. Various claims made by the site in English or French -- including on Covid vaccines -- have previously been debunked by AFP.Screenshot of on X post taken on November 29, 2023Real press conference, letterContacted by AFP on November 28, the European Parliament confirmed that the press conference had taken place the week before in a pressroom at the parliament in Strasbourg. The conference was called ""Shocking confirmations about Covid-19 vaccines"".""Any MEP has the right to use the press conference facilities, for any topic they wish,"" the Parliament told AFP. ""That being said, it is only the press conferences held by MEPs holding official positions (rapporteurs, chairs, political group leaders, etc) that are streamed/recorded and shown on the EP page,"" it added. That was not the case with this particular press conference. The letter referenced by de Graaff is available in its entirety on the EMA website. Shotscreen of the EMA website taken on November 29, 2923Dated October 18, it is notably addressed to two French MEPs who are known to hold anti-vaccine views and regularly produce disinformation: Gilbert Collard and Virginie Joron.A read-through of the letter and other EMA documents makes it clear that de Graaff's statements were inaccurate. Vaccine effectiveness on preventing transmissionIn its letter to the MEPs, the EMA wrote: ""You are indeed correct to point out that COVID-19 vaccines have not been authorised for preventing transmission from one person to another. The indications are for protecting the vaccinated individuals only.""The agency also recalled that it had noted in its assessment reports on the authorisation of the vaccines ""the lack of data on transmissibility"" in the first clinical studies from 2020. This is nothing new. As AFP already mentioned in a fact-check, from December 2020, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) indicated clearly in a detailed report on vaccine results that ""data are limited to assess the effect of the vaccine against transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from individuals who are infected despite vaccination"". The report added however that ""demonstrated high efficacy against symptomatic COVID-19 may translate to overall prevention of transmission in populations with high enough vaccine uptake.""Contacted by AFP on November 29, the EMA said: ""we clarified very early on, prior to any vaccine authorisation, that the impact of the vaccine on viral transmission would not be immediately known."" ""This was explained by our experts in a public meeting held on 11 December 2020, as well as in the press briefing held on 21 December 2020 regarding the positive opinion for Comirnaty"" (the Pfizer vaccine), it added. Following De Graaff's press conference, the EMA updated a Q&A section on its website with the question ""Do COVID-19 vaccines reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?"". (The wording of the question has since been tweaked to: ""Are COVID-19 vaccines authorised to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?"".)Screenshot of the  EMA website taken on November 29, 2023, new question circled by AFP""We published the information on our FAQ page in the last few days because indeed, despite us having clarified this point multiple times in the last three years, we saw misunderstandings and misinformation persisted,"" the EMA told AFP.In response to the question, the agency wrote on its website: ""At the beginning of the pandemic, regulators asked companies to prioritise studies looking at how well the vaccines prevented severe disease and death. Regulators did not ask companies to look at the effects of their vaccines on transmission as part of their request for authorisation.""As with the question, the wording of the response has also since been updated. It now reads ""... at how well the COVID-19 vaccines protected against the disease"" and the second sentence is no longer there. The EMA added on its website: ""It is difficult to measure how well vaccines may reduce transmission in clinical studies. This can only be done in real-world studies that include large numbers of vaccinated people. Several studies carried out after their authorisation have shown that COVID-19 vaccines can reduce the transmission of the virus.""In other words, the lack of early data on the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing transmission did not mean it was not effective at preventing serious forms of the disease and nowhere in the letter did the EMA say that it was illegal to require vaccination or to introduce mass vaccination.The agency noted in its letter that while its scientific committees issue recommendations, it is other bodies like the European Commission and national governments that are in charge of developing immunisation policies to protect the public.Ever since Covid vaccines were introduced, AFP's fact-checking team has debunked many false claims around vaccines and virus transmission, including here and here. People who came to be vaccinated against Covid in a gymnasium in Tunis in 2021 (AFP / FETHI BELAID)Younger people not exempt from Covid risksAnother false claim from de Graaff: the MEP inferred from the agency's response that ""no one under the age of 60 should have been vaccinated, with only a few exceptions"" because, according to him, ""almost no one under the age of 60 ran the risk of serious complications due to the coronavirus.""As AFP has previously shown, even if their risk of death from Covid is much lower than that of the oldest citizens, the under-60 age group is not immune to the most severe or even fatal outcomes of Covid. According to the French Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), during the first 18 months of Covid in Italy, Spain and Germany, five percent of those who died were under the age of 60. In France, 95 percent of people who died of Covid at the hospital were at least 60 years old while 98 percent of them were at least 50, according to the French public health agency. And as this February 2022 article from the French daily Le Parisien explained, death is not the only factor to consider, as the under-60 group is also not exempt from serious forms of Covid. According to the paper, in January 2022 ""more than 1,100 hospital admissions of unvaccinated Covid patients between the ages of 20 and 39 were recorded every day"".   All side effects included in safety monitoringAnother speaker at the press conference, German far-right MEP Joachim Kuhs, called into question the safety of the vaccines: ""The EMA mentioned in its letter to us that they expect, I quote, 'reports of conditions occurring at or soon after vaccination'. He then said: ""This implies that data on adverse events or side effects within 14 days of vaccination are of the utmost importance for assessing the risks related to the vaccines.""""However, member state officials adopted the policy that as it would take 10 to 14 days for the vaccine to produce spike proteins, adverse events within 14 days after vaccination were not to be registered as related to the vaccination,"" he claimed.But the EMA told AFP that this was not true: ""The reports of suspected side effects that occurred within 14 days of vaccination are not excluded from safety monitoring. When monitoring vaccine safety, EMA and EU Member States consider all reports of suspected side effects following COVID-19 vaccination, regardless of how much time has passed between receiving the vaccine and the side effect occurring.""No 'bad batches' of vaccinesFinally, Vibeke Manniche, a Danish doctor who has previously made false claims about Covid, spoke at the press conference about ""bad batches"" of vaccines: ""What we call the blue batches gave many more side effects than some of the other batches."" She claimed that her research revealed that the EMA and national institutions had not informed the public about these safety issues. But in this article from a Danish periodical, experts identified several errors concerning her study's statistical methods and the data used.For example, in the study, the batches presented as having produced the largest number of side effects were in fact the very first batches, which were never put on the market in Denmark. As in other countries at the time, the first vaccines were administered to the most vulnerable citizens who needed to be protected from Covid first -- the elderly or the sick. But this segment of the population is also the most likely to report medical concerns following vaccination that do not necessarily stem from the vaccine itself but may be due to age or prior issues. When these medical concerns arise after vaccination, they are automatically recorded by health authorities but that does not mean they were caused by the vaccine.  As for accusations of inaction on the part of EMA, the agency said: ""EMA and the EU Member States continuously monitor the EU database of suspected side effects, EudraVigilance. EMA has seen no evidence suggesting that some batches of Comirnaty caused any more side effects or more serious side effects than other batches of the vaccine.""The EMA added that official medicines control laboratories in the EU member states ""check data on the quality of every batch of COVID-19 vaccines before it is released in the EU.""AFP FranceAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKVaccins Covid-19Facebook Twitter EmailVous avez un doute sur l'authenticitÃ© d'une info, d'une citation ou d'une image ?Contactez-nous sur WhatsApp ! WhatsAppSuivez-nousAccueilA proposComment nous travaillonsRÃ¨gles Ã©ditoriales et Ã©thiquesNotre Ã©quipeManuel du fact-checkingFormationsObjectif DesinfoxContactCorrectionsAbonnement pour les prosMentions lÃ©galesFactuelCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

"EU-China “Summit of choices”: Interview with Ursula von der Leyen
","On December 5, the European Newsroom interviewed the European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen ahead of the EU-China summit on December 7. Besides trade, the EU officials plan to also address China-Russia relations, sanctioned MEPs and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, are in Beijing on Thursday to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Quiang. The summit marks the first in-person EU-China summit since 2019.Speaking to an AFP reporter who conducted the interview on behalf of the European Newsroom ahead of the trip, the commission president cited a lack of access for European companies to the Chinese market and preferential treatment of Chinese companies through subsidies as specific problems for the EU. According to von der Leyen, this is part of the reason why the trade imbalance has doubled to almost 400 billion Euro in the last two years.â€We have tools to protect our market,â€ von der Leyen said, adding that â€we prefer to have negotiated solutionsâ€.The commission is currently carrying out an investigation into potentially competition-distorting subsidies for electric vehicles coming from China, fearing subsidised imports could stifle EU innovation in a huge new sector.â€We have learned our lessons from the solar panels,â€ von der Leyen said, citing a green tech sector now dominated by Chinese firms amidst a global rush to decarbonise energy production.The EU-China summit is the first in-person summit since 2019. The summit will address the growing trade imbalances among other subjects. Photo: picture alliance/Oliver Berg/dpaThe commission president further stated that the EU wants to persuade China to use its influence on Russia, calling on the government in Beijing to take action against Chinese companies involved in circumventing the sanctions.While von der Leyen highlighted Chinaâ€™s efforts in the area of biodiversity and the reduction of methane gas as positive, she also warned that Chinaâ€™s attitude at the COP28 summit in Dubai was under scrutiny. Von der Leyen also intends to raise the case of European parliamentarians sanctioned by Beijing in 2021 for denouncing Chinese repression against the Muslim Uyghur minority.She further said that it was important to see China not only as a trading partner â€but also as a technological competitor, a military power, and as a global actor that has distinct and divergent views on the global orderâ€.Read the corresponding Key Story here.Enr on Social Mediahttps://twitter.com/BTAnewsBG/status/1732029566749749414https://twitter.com/euroefe/status/1732042904221421698https://twitter.com/ansaeuropa/status/1732062911541948790https://twitter.com/Lusa_noticias/status/1731992809425506453",1
Europe in brief: Slovakian lorry drivers join blockade on Ukrainian border,"Similar to their Polish colleagues, Slovakian lorry drivers have begun blocking a border crossing with Ukraine in protest at competition from their Ukrainian counterparts. Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva said that the negotiations for a trade deal between Mercosur and the EU could fail. Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon expressed her support for North Macedoniaâ€™s EU accession.Slovakian lorry drivers begin blocking a border crossing with UkraineBratislava (AFP) – Joining a similar movement by their Polish colleagues, Slovakian road hauliers began blocking one of the border crossings with Ukraine on Friday to protest against competition from their Ukrainian counterparts.The Slovak Road Hauliers' Association (UNAS) began a blockade at the Vysne Nemecke crossing, allowing only four lorries through every hour.""We are going to stay here until measures are taken to limit competition from Ukrainian hauliers,"" Ratislav Curma, the president of UNAS, told AFP. ""We want to support our Polish colleagues,â€ he added.Polish hauliers are calling for the restoration of a permit system for Ukrainian trucks. This system was abandoned by the European Union and its member states in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year.Kiev and Warsaw opened an extra lane on Monday for empty lorries coming from Ukraine and going to Poland, following an announcement of Ukrainian authorities on Sunday. They hoped that this decision would help to unblock the border, which has been paralysed by a protest movement of Polish lorry drivers. (3 December)Brazilian PresidentLuiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva speaks during the COP28 summit in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. EFE/EPA/ALI HAIDERLula says Mercosur and the European Union may end without a dealDubai (EFE) – Brazilian President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva said on Sunday that the current negotiations for a trade agreement between Mercosur and the European Union (EU) could fail and that if they did, it would not be for lack of will on the part of the South American countries.""If there is no agreement, be patient. It is not for lack of will,"" Lula told a press conference in Dubai. ""The only thing that has to be clear is that they can no longer say that it is Brazil's or South America's fault,"" he added.According to the Brazilian president, it is the rich countries that are responsible for the failure of the agreement, as they do not want to make any concessions and always want to gain more. In particular, Lula referred to France, whose president, Emmanuel Macron, said in a press conference on Saturday at the UN climate summit (COP28) that he opposed the agreement because it was ""not good for anyone"" and ""obsolete"".Mercosur will hold its bi-annual summit in Rio de Janeiro on 6-7 December and is expected to announce the positive conclusion of negotiations with the EU at that time. (3 December)Slovenia's Minister for Foreign and European Affairs Tanja Fajon at the Bled Strategic Forum in August. Photo: Tamino PetelinÅ¡ek/STASloveniaâ€™s Fajon urges North Macedonia to continue with reformsSkopje (STA) – On meeting Deputy Prime Minister Bojan Marinchikj on Friday, Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon reassured North Macedonia of Slovenia's support for the country's efforts to join the EU and called on all political stakeholders to focus on steps ahead.The Macedonian press agency MIA reported that Fajon had underlined the necessity of constitutional changes and other measures for EU enlargement and accession talks. ""Enlargement has become a geostrategic necessity, therefore I hope North Macedonia will show a lot of courage, confidence and hard work,"" she was quoted as saying.Marinchikj agreed with Fajon and stressed that constitutional changes were the only step that could bring his country closer to the EU. The European Commission had sent a strong message to North Macedonia in its annual progress report, saying that the country had to persist and step up its work along the course it had charted, said the deputy prime minister.""We have made headway in 80 percent of the chapters and no backsliding has been seen in any of the chapters. This doesn't mean that we've achieved everything, but it means that we have a good foundation to build on,"" Marinchikj said according to MIA.According to a press release from the Slovenian Foreign Ministry, Fajon promised that Slovenia would continue to help North Macedonia with experience and know-how in adapting to EU standards. Enlargement policy would ensure stability in the region, which was of significant importance in the current geopolitical situation, she said. The Foreign Minister also tweeted that she had thanked Marinchikj on Slovenia's behalf for North Macedonia's aid and solidarity after the country had been hit by devastating floods in early August.Fajon and Marinchikj affirmed that relations between their countries were excellent and friendly, the press release added. They vowed to strengthen them further, also through a development cooperation partnership, for which they signed a memorandum entailing 2.1 million euros worth of projects in infrastructure, sustainable development and environmental protection. The ministry said in the press release that Slovenia had contributed over 43 million euros for development projects in North Macedonia since 2010. (1 December)Spain's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Nadia CalviÃ±o speaks to journalists. Photo: EFE/RomÃ¡n RÃ­osBattle between CalviÃ±o and Vestager for EIB presidency appears settledBrussels (Belga) – More than ever, Spain's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Nadia CalviÃ±o, holds the pole position for becoming the new president of the European Investment Bank (EIB). CalviÃ±o and European Commissioner Margrethe Vestager have long been considered the favourites for the job, but now Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem, who is in charge of the appointment process, has sent a letter to his European colleagues explicitly asking them to support CalviÃ±o.The EIB is looking for a new president, because its current chief, Werner Hoyer, is due to leave the ""bank of the European Union"" on 1 January 2024. The EIB is the world's largest multilateral financial institution; the 27 EU countries are the bank's shareholders.CalviÃ±o, who only joined Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's new government in November, but was a minister before that, has been vying for the EIB presidency for some time. She is up against Vestager and candidates from Italy, Poland and Sweden. However, Vestagerâ€™s candidacy was damaged in the summer, when she appointed an American economist, Fiona Scott Morton, as Chief Economist at the European Commission's Directorate-General for Competition. This appointment caused a storm of protest, particularly in France. Scott Morton then decided to withdraw.However, Vestager has not been ruled out as a candidate for the EIB presidency. Since France, Germany and Italy are the bank's biggest shareholders – and Paris and Berlin have no compatriots in the running – everyone has been looking at her. But for a long time, the French and Germans kept their cards close to their chests, until German Chancellor Olaf Scholz recently said openly that his government was backing CalviÃ±o.Now it seems that France has also thrown its weight behind CalviÃ±o. On Friday, Minister Van Peteghem's spokeswoman confirmed a report by the news site Politico that he had sent a letter to his colleagues in the European Ecofin Council, asking them whether they could support the Spaniard's nomination rather than Vestager's.The issue will be discussed on Friday, 8 December. That is when the 27 European finance ministers will meet in Brussels for their monthly consultations and it should be clear whether CalviÃ±o has the support she needs. The choice of Werner Hoyer's successor(s) must be backed by at least 18 member states, which together contribute more than 68 percent of the EIB's capital.

European Commission chief warns China of unfair trade practices ahead of summit,"â€European leaders will not tolerate over time an imbalance in the trade relationship,â€ said European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen in an interview with the European Newsroom on Tuesday, ahead of the EU-China summit on December 7. Besides trade, the EU officials plan to also address China-Russia relations, sanctioned MEPs and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East.While the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, stressed that EU states would prefer negotiations to a trade war she left an implied threat of protectionist measures on the table.Â â€We have tools to protect our market,â€ von der Leyen told an AFP reporter who conducted the interview on behalf of the European Newsroom, adding that â€we prefer to have negotiated solutionsâ€.Von der Leyen, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell and Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, will be in Beijing on Thursday and meet Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Quiang. The summit marks the first in-person EU-China summit since 2019.Â The commission president cited a lack of access for European companies to the Chinese market and preferential treatment of Chinese companies through subsidies as specific problems for the EU. According to von der Leyen, this is part of the reason why the trade imbalance has doubled to almost 400 billion Euro in the last two years.She further said that it was important to see China not only as a trading partner â€but also as a technological competitor, a military power, and as a global actor that has distinct and divergent views on the global orderâ€. China has changed and, after a phase of opening and reform, is now pursuing a policy in which security and control are central, according to von der Leyen.Â 01.04.2022, Belgium, Brussels: European Council President Charles Michel (left), High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell speak with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and Li Keqiang, former Prime Minister of China (on monitors) via video conference during an EU-China summit. Photo: Olivier Matthys/Pool AP/dpaA â€summit of choicesâ€Stressing that both sides would have to decide whether they are prepared to make concessions to preserve the relationship, she dubbed the talks a â€summit of choicesâ€. The commission president said that Europe was not trying to â€de-coupleâ€ itself from the Chinese powerhouse, but rather to â€de-riskâ€ ties that had become too one-sided. While the European market has proved a lucrative draw for Chinese investment and exports, EU firms have not enjoyed open access to Chinaâ€™s growing consumer middle class.Chinese state aid to its companies and their preferential treatment in terms of market access are also causing displeasure. â€For every three containers that go from China to Europe, two containers return empty,â€ said the commission president, visualising the imbalance.Strong overproduction in China is leading to dumping prices. Domestic demand in the country itself is low due to weak economic growth. In addition, some other countries are closing their markets to Chinese products, which means that the products end up in Europe, emphasised von der Leyen.The EU side is also â€looking at the question of hidden and direct and indirect subsidies to Chinese companies in competition to the European companiesâ€, according to the commission president. The commission is currently carrying out an investigation into potentially competition-distorting subsidies for electric vehicles coming from China, fearing subsidised imports could stifle EU innovation in a huge new sector.â€We have learned our lessons from the solar panels,â€ von der Leyen said, citing a green tech sector now dominated by Chinese firms amidst a global rush to decarbonise energy production.Concerns about possible Chinese retaliationSeparately, a senior European official speaking on condition of anonymity, laid out Brussels' trade concerns in more detail – along with concerns about Chinese retaliation.â€We've seen retaliation by the Chinese before. It's usually not symmetric. So it doesn't necessarily hit exactly the same sectors,â€ the official said.Â â€If they want to retaliate they'll probably hit other sectors, politically sensitive sectors.â€- Senior European Official The EU official noted that Europe is entering an election cycle in the run-up to next yearâ€™s European Parliamentary elections, and that relations with China could come under political pressure. â€The Chinese side is very well aware of this,â€ he said.â€My feeling is they're fully aware of the overcapacity and the effect it has around the world, not just on us, but we're seeing basically a domino effect as other major economies are closing their market.â€ The United States – firstly under former president Donald Trump and continuing under President Joe Biden – has taken a tougher line on China.Besides trade: Russia, Sanctions and the ClimateÂ Europe, von der Leyen said, will take its own route but shares many of Washingtonâ€™s concerns, including the one about Chinaâ€™s support for Russia despite Moscowâ€™s war against Ukraine. The commission president further stated that the EU wants to persuade China to use its influence on Russia, calling on the government in Beijing to take action against Chinese companies involved in circumventing the sanctions.While von der Leyen highlighted Chinaâ€™s efforts in the area of biodiversity and the reduction of methane gas as positive, she also warned that Chinaâ€™s attitude at the COP28 summit in Dubai was under scrutiny.Â  The West is anxious that the Asian giant pull its weight in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. China is responsible for 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions.â€China's actions at the COP [World Climate Conference in Dubai] will be decisive.â€ - Commission President Ursula von der LeyenHowever, the issue of compensation payments for climate damage is likely to be a sticking point at the COP, as a senior EU official noted. China sees itself as a developing country and does not want to pay into the relevant funds as Western players such as the EU and the USA are demanding.Von der Leyen also intends to raise the case of European parliamentarians sanctioned by Beijing. â€I have always considered these sanctions to be unjustified,â€ she said. French MEP RaphaÃ«l Glucksmann and Germanyâ€™s Reinhard BÃ¼tikofer, president of the European Parliamentâ€™s delegation for relations with China, were sanctioned by Beijing in 2021 for denouncing Chinese repression against the Muslim Uyghur minority.This article is published weekly.

"Europe in brief: BiH’s Reform Plan for EU accession en route to Brussels
","Bosnia and Herzegovina's Borjana KriÅ¡to has presented the first draft of the country's reform plan to European Enlargement Commissioner OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi. A spokesman for the German FDP has accused Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n of blocking talks on Ukraineâ€™s EU accession. The latest Eurobarometer figures show a significant increase of citizens interested in the European elections compared to 2019.BiH submits initial version of its Reform Plan document to the European CommissionSarajevo (FENA) – The chairwoman of the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), Borjana KriÅ¡to, has sent the first working version of the Reform Plan for BiH to European Commissioner for Neighbourhood and Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi.This document was prepared by the ad hoc body of the BiH Council of Ministers and contains four priorities: green and digital transition, development of the private sector and business climate, development and retention of human capital and the rule of law.Based on these priorities, an indicative list of projects was drawn up, which will be further developed in dialogue with the European Commission until March, when the final Reform Agenda should be agreed upon. This agenda will contain all the reforms and conditions necessary for the approval of funds and investment projects. After that, this process will be led by a permanent working team until its completion. This team will be appointed by the BiH Council of Ministers in 2024.In the accompanying letter, chairwoman KriÅ¡to pointed out that the new Growth Package for the Western Balkans opened up new opportunities for investment in BiH's economy, integration with the EU market and access to the benefits of EU membership, which until now were unavailable to candidate countries.KriÅ¡to added that BiH faced a significant challenge in preparing the final Reform Plan, which is an important part of the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans. She also pointed out that it was extremely important to maintain the understanding and support of the European Commission to implement and successfully complete the process, with the absolute involvement and support of all constitutionally competent levels of government in BiH.KriÅ¡to took the opportunity to thank Commissioner VÃ¡rhelyi for hosting the Second High-Level Political Forum, which was held between BiH and the European Union in Brussels on 5 December.

In Berlin on Wednesday, Lechte said that OrbÃ¡n was deliberately undermining efforts and united support for Ukraine in its quest for freedom.""The future of Ukraine must not be determined by right-wing populists and open Putin friends in the EU. This once again highlights the urgent need for reforms in the EU voting process,"" explained Lechte. ""As the FDP parliamentary group, we rely on qualified majority decisions. For open foul players like OrbÃ¡n, a mechanism for temporary exclusion from the EU is needed in case of doubt.""In a letter to European Council President Charles Michel, OrbÃ¡n wrote that expectations for a decision on the start of EU accession negotiations with Ukraine and the long-term EU budget to be made at the EU summit on 14 and 15 December in Brussels were unfounded. The letter is causing unrest in Brussels, because a large majority of EU member states actually want to make far-reaching decisions in favour of Ukraine. However, a decision is only possible if no member state vetoes it.

EU members' â€˜right of vetoâ€™ still intact,"In the run-up to next year's European Parliament election, the question of EU enlargement has been the subject of political debate. It is against that background that some lawmakers and other social media users claimed in November 2023 that the European Parliament had abolished ""the right of veto"" of the European Union's member states by replacing unanimous voting with qualified majority voting in several areas. This however is inaccurate for several reasons. The claim refers to a resolution recently adopted by the European Parliament that proposes increasing the number of areas where decisions are taken by qualified majority voting, which would prevent any one country from blocking decisions. However, a resolution does not have binding value, several experts in EU law told AFP. For now, the voting process remains unchanged. Furthermore, for the proposed change to come into force, a revision of the European treaties would have to be made -- a complex process requiring unanimous approval from the member states. In other words, the European Parliament cannot force the change on its members. Facebook users have been raising the alarm (here and here) of an institutional change at the European Union that will deprive its member states of their decision-making power in crucial political domains. According to one post, ""They have abolished the right of veto for all the members of the European Union... i.e. majority voting of the 27 members of the EU."" Another said: ""The era of national sovereignty is officially over. We're talking about power a grab by the EU."" Someone even claimed there was  a ""European coup under way"", featuring ""the abolishment of the national right of veto in 65 areas, including taxation and foreign policy"".Screenshot taken on X (ex-Twitter) on November 30, 2023""The insane text voted through by the European Parliament yesterday foresees the abolishment of France's right of veto even though its vital interests are in play,"" a commenter added on X. Another tweet read: ""In total media silence, on November 22 the European Parliament passed a law allowing the revision of the European Treaties and abolishing the right of veto."" Certain politicians also shared the claim in the guise of an electoral argument. For example: Alexandre Loubet, a French lawmaker from the far-right National Rally (RN) party who is also its campaign manager for the 2024 European Parliament election. Loubet tweeted in late November that ""The European Parliament passed a resolution that abolishes the member states' veto, strengthens the powers of the EU and creates an EU government and president. Vote for the National Rally at the European elections so that France does not get lost within a European federal state!""The posts refer to the European Parliament resolution of November 22, 2023 ""on proposals of the European Parliament for the amendment of the Treaties"". While the text was indeed adopted by the European institution, it has no binding value. As it stands, the resolution has no effect on the voting process, according to several experts.""The claim is false for several reasons that stem from the nature of the act adopted by the European Parliament, the procedure required to revise the treaties and the reality of the decision-making process in the European Union,"" said Francois-Vivien Guiot, senior lecturer in European and international studies at The University of Pau and the Pays de l'Adour. He spoke to AFP on November 29, 2023.""The European Parliament passed a resolution. But it's a document without any legal force. It's simply an opinion expressed on how it sees the future of European institutions,"" added Christine Verger, vice-president of the Paris-based think-tank The Jacques Delors Institute. Verger, who is also a former director of relations with national parliaments at the European Parliament, spoke to AFP on November 28, 2023. The resolution proposes to extend the number of areas for which joint member state decisions are taken by a qualified majority vote instead of unanimously. This is what the social media posts present as the abolishment of the ""right of veto"" of each member state.MEPs during a voting session at the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, November 22, 2023. (AFP / FREDERICK FLORIN)Current voting processAs explained on ""Toute l'Europe"" (All of Europe), an educational information site on the European Union, qualified majority is one of the voting methods used within the Council of the European Union. Made up of member state ministers who meet several times a year to discuss their respective fields and adopt, reject or modify draft legislation from the European Commission, the Council of the European Union represents the EU member states and carries out the legislative role of the European Union on an equal footing with the European Parliament (which represents citizens).Depending on the areas in question, the Council of the European Union votes either by qualified majority or unanimously. As the Council of the European Union explains on its website, unanimous voting concerns a number of matters which the member states consider to be ""sensitive"", including common foreign and security policy, citizenship, EU membership and EU finances.On those matters, decisions cannot be taken without unanimity. This is the ""right of veto"" referenced by the social media users. It is worth noting that an abstention does not count as a vote against a decision.Apart from these specific areas, the Council of the European Union votes by qualified majority, which is reached when two conditions are met. Fifty-five percent of member states -- or 15 out of 27 -- must vote in favour and the proposal must also be supported by member states representing at least 65 percent of the total EU population.Unlike in the case of unanimous voting, ""an abstention under qualified majority voting counts as a vote against,"" the Council of the European Union says on its website.According to Toute l'Europe, qualified majority -- also known as the ordinary legislative procedure -- is the most common voting method within the Council of the European Union. That is because ""around 80 percent of EU legislation"" is adopted that way.""Today, some isolated instances of unanimous voting remain... but theyâ€™re just islands in a sea of qualified majority voting,"" said Helene Gaudin, an expert in EU law at Toulouse Capitole University. She spoke to AFP on November 29, 2023. Verger added: ""It is the member states that decide along with the European Parliament on a certain number of matters by qualified majority, but these are matters identified in the treaties."" The treaties for their part had to be approved unanimously by the member states to come into effect. Why the debate over unanimity?The idea of replacing unanimous voting in certain areas with qualified majority voting is supported by some politicians who hope it would prevent political deadlocks and streamline the decision-making process of the member states. The argument of increased efficiency was notably put forth by French President Emmanuel Macron in May 2022 when he raised the possibility of extending the scope of qualified majority voting. Those in favour of the idea believe it would help prevent the kinds of deadlocks that result from unanimous voting at a time of recurring tensions with, say, Hungary over migration policy, judicial independence and LGBT+ rights. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- the only EU leader to have maintained close ties with the Kremlin following Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- is very critical of EU strategy on the war-torn country and has come out against billions of euros in new EU aid for Kyiv as well as the start of Ukraine accession talks. An agreement on Ukraine or Moldova -- another country waiting for accession talks to begin -- would require unanimity among the member states. To date, Orban has shown himself to be unwilling to budge on the matter.""What gave rise to the sense that reform was needed was Hungary's blocking ability in the face of other member state's will to sanction Russia. So, okay, extending qualified majority voting to this area could be formally understood as the loss of veto power -- but from a democratic point of view, is it normal for the representatives of 26 member states to be blocked from acting by those of a single nation?"" said Guiot. ""But in practice, an isolated state within the Council is always subject to very strong pressure, which most of the time causes it to abandon its opposition. The member states always negotiate several issues simultaneously and trade-offs are made across the board. It is also important to note that even in the case of no unanimous voting, the member states still have a preference for finding consensus rather than forcing something through,"" he added. As for those in favour of maintaining unanimous voting for certain matters, they say it establishes a principle of equality among the member states, no matter their demographic importance. This argument stems from the fact that qualified majority voting takes population size partly into consideration.MEPs during a voting session at the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, November 22, 2023. (AFP / FREDERICK FLORIN)What does the resolution say?For Gaudin, the resolution adopted on November 22, 2023 by the European Parliament ""defends a certain vision of Europe, less blocked by the member states on everything related to the revision, and in a way a vision of a more federal Europe.""According to the text, the resolution proposes ""considerably increasing the number of areas where actions are decided by qualified majority voting and through the ordinary legislative procedure.""It also suggests in matters of foreign, security and defence policy for ""decisions on sanctions, interim steps in the enlargement process and other foreign policy decisions to be taken by qualified majority voting.""Above all, the resolution makes a case for a revision of the European Treaties and calls on the European Council -- made up of the heads of government of every member state and tasked with defining the EU's political policies and priorities -- to convene a Convention on the matter.Non-binding resolutionBut this text is not binding, according to Guiot: ""The adopted resolution is not a legislative act. It does not have legal effects but instead demonstrates a political position of the institution. With this resolution, the European Parliament called for a revision of the treaties and proposed modifications to the existing treaties."" ""The European Parliament only proposed to eliminate unanimity, so to make qualified majority the rule for adopting acts,â€ Gaudin for her part said. She added that the claims circulating on social media are ""still very much in the realm of imagination because it's just a proposal"". MEPs during a voting session at the European Parliament, in Strasbourg, November 22, 2023. (AFP / FREDERICK FLORIN)Complicated revision processFor the changes proposed in the resolution to take effect, a revision of the European treaties is necessary. The long and complicated procedure is laid out in Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union. It is explained on the French government site Vie Publique.""This ordinary revision relies on a very complex procedure in which the member states have the final word,"" Guiot said. In order to be adopted, a draft revision of the treaties -- whether put forward by the European Parliament, the European Commission or the national governments -- must be submitted to the European Council as well as to the national parliaments.The European Council is then free to refuse the project or to pursue the initiative. In the latter scenario, it must convene a Convention of representatives of the European Parliament, the European Commission, the national parliaments and governments to examine the project and make amendments. The text is then submitted to a Conference of member state government representatives, who must agree on the treaty amendments to be made. Finally, the draft revision must be ratified by all member states, according to the unanimity rule. It would be enough for one country to oppose the revision for it to be rejected.  Treaty revisions require unanimityAccording to Verger, what the social media posts ""forget to mention is that it's national sovereignty that applies when making these kinds of changes... It is the member states that decide. Every time there is an institutional change, it is the subject of a treaty that must be signed by every member state and ratified by all of their parliaments. It is legally, and even politically, impossible for the European Parliament to decide anything in this regard.""For such a revision, ""it is necessary for the member states to approve it unanimously every step of the way,"" Gaudin said. ""The states are the masters of the treaties because they're the ones who decide whether they want to adopt them or not,"" she added. Guiot added: ""Implementation of the changes suggested by the European Parliament (in the resolution of November 22, 2023) is still a distant prospect and it cannot become reality without unanimous and repeated consent from the member states.""In May 2022, following Macron's call to extend qualified majority voting, 13 member states announced in a joint statement that they were opposed to such a change and to Treaty revision. This indicates the unlikelihood of the reform ever coming to pass.  In recent months, AFP has debunked many false or misleading claims about France's alleged loss of sovereignty to the European Union, including here and here.Alexis ORSINIAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKAFP France All articlesEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU reaches landmark legislation to regulate AI,"The European Union has agreed on landmark legislation to regulate artificial intelligence (AI). Bulgaria expects to complete a report next summer on its readiness to join the euro area by 2025. Iran accuses a Swedish EU diplomat of conspiring with Israel.European Union reaches landmark agreement on AIBrussels (Belga) – With the AI Act, the European Union aims to respect its citizens' security and fundamental rights while safeguarding and even boosting the innovative nature and competitiveness of the European AI sector. By being the first to come up with such legislation, it aims to set an international standard.The basic principle is that AI systems will be classified according to their risk profile. Most AI applications will fall into the 'minimal risk' category and will therefore not have to comply with specific obligations. These include, for example, spam filters or 'recommender systems' that make suggestions to users based on a certain algorithm (such as customised playlists or product listings in online shops).Itâ€™s different with â€œhigh-riskâ€ AI. Because artificial intelligence is inextricably linked to large data sets, AI systems will not be permitted to collect just any data and will have to reduce their inherent risk as best as possible. Every activity must be documented, users must know where they stand and there must be human supervision at all times. Biometric identification and applications that automatically recognise emotions are classified as high risk by definition.During the negotiations between member states and the European Parliament, there was a lot of talk about the AI applications that pose an ""unacceptable risk"" and should therefore be banned. For instance, Parliament called for a total ban on biometric identification. Member states were nevertheless able to secure some exceptions. For example, the use of real-time facial recognition will be permitted, but only in the search for victims of kidnappers or human traffickers, or to prevent clear threats such as terrorist attacks. In such cases, it will also be allowed to track suspects through biometric identification, but prior permission from an investigating judge will be required.Applications for which no exceptions were agreed upon – and which will therefore always be banned – include 'social scoring' as it exists in China: The random scraping of facial images to build databases and categorise people based on their political, religious or philosophical beliefs, their sexual orientation or race. Emotion recognition in the workplace or in education will also be banned.Transparency requirements are another particular focus of the new legislation. Anyone who uses an AI system such as a chatbot will always need to be informed that he or she is communicating with a machine. Deepfakes and other AI content should always be labelled as such.In recent months, advanced generative AI applications such as ChatGPT, DALL-E and Bard took off, which can create texts, images and other content. These 'foundation models' will be subject to additional transparency obligations. They will have to comply with European copyright regulations and will need to be accompanied by detailed summaries of the content used to train the models. For generative AI that may contain systemic risks, there will be further obligations.To boost innovation in the European AI sector, small AI players will be able to develop their applications in ring-fenced environments, so they are not crushed by big international players. ""The AI Act is much more than a rulebook â€” it's a launchpad for EU startups and researchers to lead the global race for trustworthy AI,"" concludes Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, who spearheaded the legislation.

There are absolutely no grounds for keeping Johan Floderus in detention,"" EU diplomatic chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday, once again calling for his ""immediate release.â€In photos published by the agency of the judicial authority on Sunday, the 33-year-old Swede appeared for the first time since his arrest in April 2022, wearing a pale blue prison uniform and handcuffs.His trial began behind closed doors in Tehran on Saturday. According to Mizan Online, the judicial authority agency, he is on trial for ""corruption on the earth"" – punishable by death – and for taking part in ""acts against the security of Iran, through extensive intelligence cooperation with the Zionist regime.â€ (December 10)Bulgaria expects to complete a report in June on its readiness to join the euro area by 2025Brussels (BTA) – Bulgaria was expecting the completion of a report next June on its readiness to join the eurozone from 2025, announced Bulgarian Finance Minister Asen Vassilev.â€œWe have reported progress on the conditions since our admission to the Banking Union, where we have completed almost everything. The law on the Bulgarian National Bank, which received the approval of the European Commission and the European Central Bank, still needs to be passed by parliament. We expect to finish this part in January,â€ he said after participating in a meeting of his EU colleagues in Brussels.â€œWe meet three of the four conditions, including the deficit. The deficit at the end of November was 0.6 percent, with a requirement of 3 percent. For the next year, the budget is planned within the framework of the Maastricht criteria. We received very strong support in the Eurogroup. A report will be drawn up, which will be considered in June, after the European Parliament elections,â€ Finance Minister Asen Vassilev said. According to him, the specific date for Bulgaria's accession to the eurozone will be determined based on this report.Furthermore, the Minister said that Bulgaria was expecting a second payment from the EU funds for the recovery of the economies from the pandemic by February. A transfer of around 700 million euros was expected. The Council of the EU approved changes in the Bulgarian plan. On this occasion, Vassilev recalled that some projects were dropped from the plan due to the reduction of the total amount for Bulgaria.The actual change in the plan is yet to be discussed with the European Commission. It will probably be adopted in January or February. The rules for choosing the composition of the anti-corruption commission and the plan for changes in the energy sector still had to be adopted, Minister Vassilev said.A message from the Council of the EU states that Bulgaria submitted a proposal for changes to the plan in September without the part concerning energy. In total, according to the plan, Bulgaria expects 5.7 billion euros in grants, instead of the initially pledged 6.3 billion euros. The amount was changed due to the improved state of the Bulgarian economy. (December 8)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

EU seeks budget top-up to boost urgent aid for Ukraine,"The European Commission asked the member states for an additional 66 billion Euro for the coming years, partly to finance additional aid for Ukraine, due to a lack of money in the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The increase in the long-term budget is to be discussed by the European heads of government at the EU summit at the end of this week. A protracted debate is looming.European leaders will meet in Brussels on December 14 and 15 for the last European Council summit of the year. Among other things, financial aid for Ukraine will be discussed at the summit as part of the negotiations on the long-term EU budget for the period 2021 to 2027 – a budget that comprises around 1.1 trillion Euro. In June, the European Commission requested a 66 billion Euro top-up of that budget.Several countries, including Germany, had strongly criticised the request for more money. There is only broad agreement on further payments for Ukraine, although Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n is threatening to veto this.Hungary opposes increase in aidOrbÃ¡n has reiterated Budapest's opposition to the Commission's proposed budget review, which includes, among other things, 50 billion Euro earmarked for Kyiv, suggesting the creation of ""a separate financial fund, outside the EU budget, based on an intergovernmental agreement"" with contributions from member states on a voluntary basis. ""Everyone,"" he explained, ""should put the money they want for Ukraine"" into this ad hoc fund. OrbÃ¡n opposes any increase in aid to Ukraine, which is part of the proposal on the table and requires unanimous agreement. However, it is not the only difficulty, as the rest of the countries also have divergences regarding migration management and how to obtain the funds to raise the support items for Kyiv.Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. Photo: EUROPA PRESS/E. Parra.At the same time, Budapest is waiting on the European Commission to take a decision on the release of part of the European funds, up to ten billion Euro, intended for Hungary. The tug-of-war between Brussels and Budapest over the release of funds is intertwined with two of the main issues on the table at this weekâ€™s summit: the green light for Ukraine to begin EU accession negotiations and the Commission's proposed budget review.Overall, the EU has ordered the freezing of some 22 billion Euro in cohesion funds for the 2021 to 2027 programming period and 5.8 billion Euro in recovery funds in response to violations of the rule of law alleged against Viktor OrbÃ¡n's government. In December, EU finance ministers approved the payment of 920 million Euro to Hungary as part of a review of its recovery plan. This decision, announced by the Council of the European Union, comes just a few days before the Commission is due to release nearly ten billion Euro in cohesion funds intended for Hungary. These payments have been suspended under the horizontal enabling conditions pending an improvement in the independence of the judicial system through a number of reforms.Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez at the EU leaders' summit in October. Photo: Thierry Monasse/STASpain seeks compromises to unblock budget amid Hungaryâ€™s aid refusalSpain, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has proposed to reduce the requested amount by the European Commission to the Member States for the EU budget for the next four years roughly by half, from 66 billion to 36 billion Euro. The fund of 50 billion Euro for Ukraine would remain intact.The Spanish proposal means reducing the Multiannual Financial Framework for the period 2024 to 2027 from the 99 billion Euro proposed by the European Commission to 84 billion, while the 'fresh' money would be cut from 65.8 billion to 51 billion, to which another 33 billion would be added in the form of loans to Ukraine.With this proposal, Spain is seeking to make concessions to those countries most reluctant to make extraordinary disbursements for the budget and to respond to Hungary's refusal to allocate funds to Ukraine, in an attempt to unblock the debate ahead of the next leaders' meeting.To fill the gap in the budget, it proposes to redirect 15 billion Euro from existing plans and to count on another extra 15 to 17 billion Euro that it hopes to obtain from revenues from frozen Russian assets.Sloveniaâ€™s Prime Minister on the budget review: balance is neededSlovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob believes that the revision of the EU's Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) must be balanced. While Slovenia supports additional funding for Ukraine, the government thinks this is not the only additional spending that should be accounted for. It wants the inclusion of other priorities such as migration, the Solidarity Fund and the Western Balkans, Golob said on the sidelines of the EU leaders' summit in October. ""We want the package to be balanced and we will defend this position,"" Golob said.  Furthermore, Slovenia is hoping to benefit most from the increase in the Solidarity Fund, as it was hit by severe floods in August.""We want the package to be balanced and we will defend this position.""Robert Golob, Prime Minister of SloveniaEuropean leaders are set to decide on the EU budget on Thursday and Friday during their last gathering of the year.

Slovenia's main climate negotiator Tina KobilÅ¡ek said the ""transition away"" from polluting fossil fuels was a key point.""It is true that the transition away from fossil fuels is limited to energy systems, but you have to start somewhere,"" he said. Never before in the history of climate conferences had a text mentioned fossil fuels, said Kumer in his comment on COP28 in Dubai.""It is crucial that ... we start to address and mitigate the climate crisis quickly, within this decade,"" Kumer said. He also pointed to the decision on the first day of the conference to create a financial fund for loss and damage resulting from climate change, and on the location of the next climate summit, COP29, which will be Azerbaijan.""This is a good basis on which we will have to build,"" Kumer said, adding that the EU, together with the presidency of the conference, played a key role in the adoption of the agreement.

Foto: Fred Marvaux/EU Parliament/dpaEuropean Parliament: Citizens should have EU-wide access to prescriptionsBrussels (dpa) – Germans who need to go to hospital while on holiday in Spain or France, for example, should in the future be able to access prescriptions, laboratory results and medical records – that's what the European Parliament called for. On Wednesday, MEPs voted by a large majority in favour of storing this information in a so-called European health data space.The project still has to be finalised with the EU member states. Negotiations are due to begin on Thursday, so that the project can be finalised before the European elections in June of next year. According to Parliament's position, healthcare professionals would only be able to access their patients' data if it was necessary for their treatment. In addition, data should be made available to researchers, for example.The co-chair of the German conservative CDU/CSU group in the European Parliament, Angelika Niebler, described the plan as a quantum leap. ""The new digital patient file will make it easy to visit doctors in other member states,"" she said. She emphasised that patients could decide for themselves who should have access to their data and which data should remain hidden.According to Patrick Bayer, MEP for the Pirate Party, there should also be a right to object to an electronic patient file. However, whether this will be enshrined in the final version of the proposal will only become clear in the negotiations with the EU member states. ""A compulsory electronic patient file with Europe-wide access entails irresponsible risks of theft, hacking or loss of highly personal treatment data,"" Bayer emphasised.Vehement criticism was voiced by Sylvia Limmer from the German far-right AfD party. She sees ""EU fanatics"" at work, who want to get their hands on the German healthcare system. She also expressed concerns that the data might not be protected well enough. According to Parliament, there are plans for strict data protection. (13 December)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published Tuesdays and Fridays.

Western Balkans still knocking on Europe's door,"The EU has again reaffirmed its full commitment to the accession prospects of the Western Balkans. The geostrategic environment with Russia's war in Ukraine and the crisis in the Middle East threatens global security, emphasising the importance of the Western Balkans for the EU. EU and Western Balkan leaders met in Brussels on December 13, one year after the Tirana summit in 2022. The summit aimed at bringing the Western Balkans closer to the EU by driving forward political integration, laying a future economic foundation and mitigating the impact of Russia's war in Ukraine.The President of the European Parliament, Roberta Metsola, said on Wednesday that, compared to previous years, for the first time there was an understanding among EU member states to prepare for enlargement. Metsola also recalled that the European Commission recommended the conditional opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).At the summit on December 14, the European leaders decided to open accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova, approved candidate status for Georgia, and to open negotiations with â€œBosnia and Herzegovina once the necessary degree of compliance with the membership criteria is reached and has invited the commission to report by March with a view to taking such a decision,â€ European Council President Charles Michel announced on the platform X, formerly known as Twitter.https://twitter.com/CharlesMichel/status/1735350188883968000On Wednesday, he stated that the Western Balkan countries should complete further reforms before being welcomed into the European Union. ""We are expecting from them more reforms, especially in the field of rule of law, in the field of the independence of justice."" He added however that there is ""strong political determination"" in the region to carry out the needed reforms.Golob: â€˜Enlargement must be seen in geopolitical termsâ€™ Slovenia has long been a staunch supporter of Bosnia-Herzegovina's accession to the EU  and Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said the country should be treated in the same package as Ukraine and Moldova. Ahead of Wednesdayâ€™s summit, Golob called on EU leaders to bear geopolitics in mind and demanded a package treatment of EU candidate countries. ""The issue of enlargement must be seen in geopolitical terms and [the countries must be] treated as a package wherever possible,"" he said.Golob made a stop in Paris en route to Brussels for talks with President Emmanuel Macron. Asked whether Macron supported Slovenia's initiative that Bosnia should be granted candidate status now, he said it was up to Macron to answer that. ""In principle, however, we have the same position on that,"" Golob said.Slovenia is part of the so-called group of â€˜Friends of Western Balkansâ€™, with Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Greece, Italy and Slovakia, who call for stronger signals to the region.On Thursday, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said that Bosnia and Herzegovina has been sent a strong political signal and a clear time frame to open accession negotiations in March next year. PlenkoviÄ‡ added that this is an excellent incentive for BiHâ€™s Council of Ministers, led by Charwoman Borjna KriÅ¡ta, with whom he was in contact all day, to take several more important steps in the next two months in fulfilling the required criteria.EU leaders made the decision unexpectedly quickly after Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n waived his veto by abstaining, that is, he left the room during the vote.Italy wanted a signal on Bosnia and HerzegovinaThe decision to open negotiations with BiH once the necessary membership criteria are fulfilled was also strongly advocated by Italy.  Ahead of the summit, Italy has demanded that a ""clear signal"" must be given to BiH. For Rome, it was not sufficient to state in the declaration that ""the EU is ready"" to open negotiations with Sarajevo.Meanwhile, the General Affairs Council welcomed in the conclusions the reform efforts undertaken by BiH after the granting of candidate status in December 2022. It was emphasised that some important steps and commitments have been made towards the fulfillment of key priorities, despite the negative developments in the Republika Srpska entity. Also, as stated, the Council encouraged further progress needed in reforms and stressed the importance of ensuring full compliance of all adopted laws with the acquis of the EU and European standards.Chairman of the BiH Presidency Å½eljko KomÅ¡iÄ‡, addressing the summit in Brussels, said that the fulfillment of 14 key priorities from the Opinion of the European Commission from May 2019 is essential for the further progress of BiH.More countries in the waiting lineThe rest of the neighbouring countries – Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia – have ambitions to join the EU as well, but are faced with lengthy and meticulous accession procedures.Montenegro, considered the frontrunner, started talks in 2012, followed by Serbia in 2014. Both countries, however, are far from fully aligning their laws and standards with EU norms.Albania and North Macedonia opened accession talks last year, more than a decade after having applied for membership.Kosovo's case is hindered by the fact that five EU countries have not recognised its independence after Kosovo broke away from Serbia in 2008.North-Macedonian Prime Minister Dimitar KovaÄevski said that North Macedonia has completed the screening process, which has been validated by the EU, but ""we all know there is one more task we have to complete"". North Macedonia still has to change its constitution to solve the long-standing issue with neighbouring Bulgaria, by adding a reference to the existence of an ethnic Bulgarian minority. He added that â€œthe draft conclusions are very clear and we will certainly move forward with the reforms, whereas the process of constitutional amendments is inevitable,â€ he said ahead of the EU-Western Balkans summit in Brussels on Wednesday. ""It is now up to us but the discussion will continue, for sure,"" KovaÄevski concluded.The Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said earlier regarding North Macedoniaâ€™s accession to the EU that Bulgaria supports EU enlargement in the Western Balkans but has so far vetoed North Macedoniaâ€™s accession over historical, cultural and language disputes. Sofia has set a requirement from Skopje to implement the Treaty of Friendship, Good-Neighbourliness and Cooperation between the two countries and adopt constitutional changes which will include Bulgarians in North Macedoniaâ€™s Constitution. The amendments drafted by North Macedoniaâ€™s government have been widely debated but not yet adopted in parliament.Serbia agrees with the declaration, opposes sanctions on Russia""It's good that we have the EU-Western Balkans summit because, in addition to the European political community, it's a new format in which we from the Western Balkans can always talk openly, honestly and completely transparently with EU leaders,"" Serbian Prime Minister Ana BrnabiÄ‡ told reporters.European Council President Charles Michel urged the Western Balkan countries to fully align with the EU Foreign and Security Policy. He also referred to the application of sanctions, since Serbia refuses to adopt those imposed on Russia by the invasion of Ukraine, despite being a candidate for accession. BrnabiÄ‡ said that, regarding the EU values, Serbia agreed with the EU declaration. Yet when it comes to sanctions against Russia, she said that the Serbian people are against the introduction of any kind of sanctions â€œbecause we suffered from sanctions during the 1990s. We think that sanctions always endanger the most vulnerable among the populationâ€, BrnabiÄ‡ concluded.Borrell: â€˜Deliver promises, avoid frustrationâ€™EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell deplored the slow progress of accession procedures.""What we have to do is to deliver on our promises and avoid frustration and fulfill the expectation that has been created,"" he said.""Accession negotiations are one part of our effort to bring the Western Balkans closer, but the other part is to look at the economy,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after the meeting. ""If you look at the Western Balkan economies, they stand today at around 35 percent of the EU average. In other words, there's a lot of untapped potential,"" she said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel at the EU-Western Balkan Summit, 13 December 2023, Brussels. Foto: Virginia Mayo/AP/dpa""Whether, for example, a solar photovoltaic power plant in Albania or a railway in Montenegro. These are the projects we are pushing forward,"" von der Leyen said. ""And finally, young people, the most precious part of our lives. In October, we were happy and honored to open the local office of the College of Europe in Tirana. I can report that by now 500 students have already applied to come and study there next year. The European Union will finance 15 scholarships,"" said von der Leyen.Economic cooperation and targeted investments in infrastructure like roads, railways, internet and electricity networks are to boost the region's economies. The commission announced a new 680 million Euro investment package for projects in rail transport and renewable energy in the Western Balkans.While the countries are still waiting to become EU members, people and businesses should ""feel as soon as possible the positive effects of this engagement with the EUâ€, Michel said.The EU would like to encourage ""more investments"" and ""more economic developmentâ€, he said.A proposed fund worth up to 6 billion Euro however is caught up in an EU internal debate on the revision of the bloc's joint budget.This article is published weekly.

EU not working on law to 'seize and scrap' cars,"In July, the European Commission proposed revising the existing legislation on end-of-life vehicles -- vehicles that are no longer usable due to age or accident. Some social media posts claimed that this ""new law"" would allow the European Union to ""seize and scrap your car if it doesn't meet their criteria"". But that is false, according to AFP's interviews with the European Commission and an expert in environmental law. In terms of obligations on vehicle owners, the proposed regulation only recalls the existing requirement that they deliver their end-of-life vehicles to registered scrapyards, known as authorised treatment facilities. All of the other obligations concern manufacturers and the member states. The goal there is to improve the quality of the collection, treatment and recycling of the vehicles. ""The EU is working on a new law to seize and scrap your car if it doesn't meet their criteria. It's all part of their climate agenda. The state will decide how long you will be allowed to own your car,"" said a post on X and Telegram by Silvano Trotta, whose false claims have repeatedly been debunked by AFP's fact-checking team. Screenshot of a post on X, taken on November 30, 2023The claim was first posted in English by @PeterSweden -- real name Peter Imanuelsen -- who describes himself as a Swedish ""journalist"" and ""political commentator"" and shares content that calls into question global warming.The post was then picked up, among others, by the French blog Planetes 360, which frequently shares disinformation.""The EU has something called the End-of-life vehicles directive, and they are looking to expand this to become so draconian that it recalls something that would have happened in the Communist Soviet Union,"" the original post added. Better recycling of end-of-life vehiclesIn July 2023, the European Commission proposed revising the existing legislation on circularity requirements for vehicle design as well as on management of end-of-life vehicles.Circularity, in the sense of the circular economy, consists of generating ""goods and services in a sustainable manner by limiting the consumption and waste of resources and the production of waste,"" the French government explained on its website. With this proposal, the European Commission would like to introduce a single regulation to replace the 2005 directive on the reusability, recyclability and recoverability of motor vehicles and the 2000 directive on end-of-life vehicles.A regulation is directly applicable in member states after its entry into force. Unlike a directive, it does not first need to be transposed into national law. The goal of the revision is to improve ""design and end-of-life management of cars"" in order ""to enhance the circularity of the automotive sector"", the Commission said in a July press release.""The proposed actions are expected to generate 1.8 billion euros net revenue by 2035, with additional jobs created and enhanced revenue streams for the waste management and recycling industry,"" it added.However, the proposed regulation does not grant the EU the right to ""seize and scrap your car if it doesn't meet their criteria"", as the social media post claimed. The regulation proposal is available to read here.Its goal is to ""provide a better framework for how we get rid of end-of-life vehicles in order to improve the way they are collected, treated and recycled,"" Adalbert Jahnz, a European Commission spokesman, told AFP on November 29.""But every owner remains the one to decide what he does with his vehicle. There is no talk of the EU being able to seize a vehicle and scrap it,"" he said. According to Emma Babin, an environmental attorney with the law firm Gossement Avocats, the proposed regulation mainly aims to enhance the ""circularity"" of the design and production of vehicles.  ""The EU won't be seizing anything. We're talking about a text that lays down rules on including recycled material and on vehicle disassembly,â€ she told AFP on November 29. â€œThe regulation would therefore mainly impose obligations on the manufacturers, the vehicle treatment facilities and the member states. Not so much on vehicle owners. That isn't the goal,"" she added.Compressed wrecks of cars on the site of the company â€œSurplus recyclingâ€, on October 6, 2022 in Gaillac, in the department of Tarn (South of France). (AFP / CHARLY TRIBALLEAU)The proposed regulation would notably require:-that every vehicle be constructed so that it is reusable or recyclable to a minimum of 85 percent by mass (Article 4) -that the authorised treatment facilities shall depollute the vehicles (Article 29)-that the member states take necessary incentives to promote the reuse, remanufacturing and refurbishment of parts and components (Article 33)The sole obligations for vehicle owners are listed in Article 26.Screenshot of the article 36 of the proposed regulation, taken on November 30, 2023The requirement for owners of end-of-life vehicles to deliver their vehicles to authorised treatment facilities only had already been defined in the above-mentioned 2000 directive on end-of-life vehicles.What is an end-of-life vehicle?Article 3 defines an end-of-life vehicle as a ""vehicle which is waste as defined in Article 3, point (1), of Directive 2008/98/EC, or vehicles that are irreparable according to criteria Part A, points 1 and 2 of Annex I.""Here is the list of criteria proposed by the European Commission to determine whether a vehicle is an end-of-life vehicle. It notably falls under the definition if it has been ""cut into pieces or stripped"", ""welded up"" or ""completely burnt"". Screenshot of the annex to the proposed regulation, taken on November 30, 2023Screenshot of the annex to the proposed regulation, taken on November 30, 2023The social media post claimed that the EU will establish a new set of criteria ""that will decide whether you will be allowed to keep your car. If your car does not meet the criteria, the EU will seize your car and scrap it.""But Jahnz said this is not true: ""no criteria will be established to 'decide whether you will be allowed to keep your car'. It will be up to the owner of the vehicle to decide whether he wants to get rid of it.""Forbidden exportsHe said the criteria listed above would be consulted primarily in the event of a resale to ""determine whether it is a used vehicle or an end-of-life vehicle"". In the case of the latter, ""the scraps must be handled responsibly instead of polluting the environment and wasting valuable resources"". In fact, the second goal of the proposed regulation is to tackle the issue of illicit exports of non-roadworthy vehicles under the guise of used vehicles. In the proposed regulation, the European Commission explains that ""an important share of â€˜missing vehiclesâ€™ subject to the ELV Directive are not collected to be treated under proper environmental conditions and a large volume of non-roadworthy and polluting used vehicles are exported from the EU every year"".In 2017, 3.8 million end-of-life vehicles were found to be of ""unknown whereabouts"", according to a European Commission report. ""The point of the criteria list is to assist the competent authorities in detecting potential wrongdoing in the form of attempts to sell end-of-life vehicles as used vehicles in order to circumvent waste management rules,"" Jahnz said. The list of controls and requirements on the export of used vehicles is laid out in Article 38.According to the Commission, the proposed actions ""will contribute to better road safety in third countries by preventing the export of non-roadworthy vehicles and reducing harmful pollution and health risks in countries importing used vehicles from the EU.""Employees work on engines extracted from damaged vehicles in a workshop of the company ""Surplus Recyclage"", on October 6, 2022 in Gaillac, in the department of Tarn (South of France). (AFP / CHARLY TRIBALLEAU)Circularity passportThe social media post also claimed that the EU wanted to ""introduce a 'circular passport' for vehicles. In other words, a passport for your car.""While a circularity passport has indeed been proposed, it is in no way a ""travel document providing or refusing permission to drive within the EU,"" Jahnz said.  ""This is a circularity passport, in reference to the circular economy. The goal being to ensure that the vehicle's raw materials circulate: that we reuse them and do a better job at recycling them,"" he added.Described in Article 13, the circularity vehicle passport will be ""a digital tool used to improve the provision of information on the safe removal and replacement of vehicle parts and components in a manner that is consistent with other digital information tools and platforms that already exist or are in further development in the automotive sector"".""It's just one more document tied to the vehicle, and itâ€™s mostly meant for the treatment facility that will take charge of the vehicle,"" Babin said. According to Article 13, the circularity passport of a vehicle that has become an end-of-life vehicle ""shall cease to exist at the earliest six months after the certificate of destruction for that end-of-life vehicle was issued"".Finally, the social media post also claimed that ""if the cost of repairing your car exceeds the value of your car, then the EU will seize it and scrap it for you"". It also alleged that ""if your car has missed its regular EU checkup for two years, then it is considered to be 'waste' and they will scrap it"". However, there is no mention of either claim in the proposed regulation. ""These claims are completely false and are not based on anything in the proposal,"" Jahnz said. In France, a vehicle must be destroyed if considered to be a wreck, according to Cartegriseminute, a French site with car information.""This is the case when it has been subject to an accident, and after assessment, it has been judged to be technically or economically beyond repair or even a hazard,â€ it said.European legislative processThe proposal is for the moment just a draft regulation.""The proposal was made by the European Commission. It's now up to the Parliament and the Council to debate, amend and adopt the text,"" said Jahnz. The main decision-making bodies of the European UnionAt the Parliament, the text must be adopted by a majority of voters while in the case of the Council it is qualified majority voting.As explained on ""Toute l'Europe"" (All of Europe), an information site on the European Union, two conditions must be met for there to be a qualified majority: fifty-five percent of member states -- or 15 out of 27 -- must vote in favour and the proposal must be supported by member states representing at least 65 percent of the total EU population.The entire legislative process takes time, which means it could be a matter of months or even years before the proposed regulation is adopted. consacrÃ©s aux enjeux de l'Ã©nergie, du climat et de la biodiversitÃ© ici.ChloÃ© RABSAll  articlesAFP FranceAll articlesTranslation : Anna Maria JAKUBEKEmailFollow usHomeAbout AFPHow we workEditorial & Ethical standardsFact-Checking StylebookMeet the teamTrainingSubscribeContactCorrectionsLegal informationFact CheckCopyright Â© AFP 2017-2023.

Europe in brief: EU decides to open accession talks with Ukraine and Moldova,"Slovakiaâ€™s Prime Minister Robert Fico has said that the decision to open accession negotiations with Ukraine was being overrated. The Dutch government has decided to lift its veto on Bulgaria joining the Schengen area. The EU is supporting an Albanian awareness campaign aimed at informing travellers about the rules for transporting money in and out of the country.Fico: EU's decision to start accession process with Ukraine overratedBrussels (TASR) – Ukraine deserved European prospects but Thursday's decision of the European Council to start accession talks with Kiev was overrated, Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico stated on Friday, following the two-day EU summit in Brussels.The Slovak premier said he doesn't understand the EUâ€™s ""obsession"" with Ukraine, but he supported the opening of the accession process. At the summit, Slovakia didn't even block the revision of the EU's long-term budget, on which the leaders eventually didn't agree.""I'm a bit disturbed by the obsession with Ukraine, I also said it in my speech that we should be obsessed with our problems in the EU,"" said the Prime Minister, adding that the leaders approved the opening of the accession process for Ukraine and Moldova without any criticism or internal analysis. They also granted the status of a candidate country to Georgia and agreed that Bosnia and Herzegovina will have the opportunity to open accession chapters in the foreseeable future.""We close our eyes to the phenomena that are happening in Ukraine, but I said that the country deserves European prospects. However, he said, â€œthis political gesture, which we have made, is overrated.â€ Hopefully, we don't think that this will change the conditions on the battlefield,"" said Fico.""I wish Ukraine all the best in its European outlooks,"" noted Fico and pointed out that he was set to meet in January with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal at the Slovak-Ukrainian border. In addition to the agreed topic of providing humanitarian and civil aid, he wants to offer him the experience that Slovakia had with the accession process.In this context, Fico criticised the fact that the leaders at the summit didn't make a positive decision in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina. According to him, this country can be described as a 'barrel of gunpowder' – also because of the strained relations between the Republika Srpska entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the UN high representative, and those between the countryâ€™s individual communities. (15 December)Bulgaria's land borders with Romania and Greece will remain in place for the time being, if Vienna continues to insist that only air traffic controls should be abolished. According to the Union of International Carriers, the non-Schengen status of Bulgaria costs local transport companies 50 million euros a year. Photo: BTA / Nikolay GrudevThe Netherlands lifts veto on Bulgaria's Schengen accession, Austriaâ€™s still in placeThe Dutch government agreed to lift its veto against Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said after the EU leaders' summit in Brussels on December 13-15. The Dutch government has sent a letter with its decision to the country's parliament. It recalls the results of the last European Commissionâ€™s fact-finding mission to Bulgaria and notes that no shortcomings were found.â€œThe Bulgarian government implemented reforms in the rule of law. Therefore, the conclusion was that Bulgaria has met the requirements to join the Schengen area,â€ the Dutch cabinet pointed out.â€œFor years, we have been stopping the accession of both countries. Last year, we gave a positive assessment for Romania, now we have to be honest and take this step for Bulgaria as well,â€ Rutte noted.His caretaker government is obliged to inform Parliament about every decision it takes. Decisions do not have to be put to a vote by MPs, but Parliament can decide to veto them.Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov expressed his expectations of a positive assessment from the Dutch parliament. He stressed that a very difficult road had been travelled in recent months to make this possible.â€œThe laws adopted by the National Assembly, the closure of the European Commission's Mechanism for Cooperation and Verification, the positive results of the mission in Bulgaria, which was attended by representatives of The Hague and Vienna. All these were right signs and they led to the fact that we expect a positive development,â€ Denkov stated.He added that the negotiations with Austria were continuing. â€œDifferent options are being discussed. Certainly, without a positive decision from the Netherlands, the talks would be redundant. This was extremely important,â€ Denkov stressed.According to Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mariya Gabriel, the decision of the Dutch government to let Bulgaria join Schengen is an â€œextremely positive sign.â€ Commenting on the upcoming decision of the Parliament in The Hague, she added that she expected there to be consistency.â€œWhen you work with facts and when you consider a decision to be fair as results have been achieved, we should have such a decision in the parliament as well, of course respecting their right to debate and take it in accordance with their rules,â€ Gabriel told bTV on December 17.She pointed out that Bulgaria had a strong position because of facts and results and recalled that the European Commission had recognized that Bulgaria had a strong border management system and was key to protecting the external border of the European Union.

Travellers must declare amounts above 10,000 euros to the customs authorities, at the time of entry to or exit from Albania, to avoid the risk of violating legal obligations in the fight against illegal transportation and money laundering.The cap set is part of Albania's efforts to secure state borders within the framework of the Â EU accession process. The campaign is being carried out through informative posters placed at all border points, as well as insights posted on social media. (18 December)A photographer wears a T-shirt with a slogan in favour of press freedom at the edge of a demonstration. Photo: picture alliance / dpaEU agreement: Better protection for media against political influenceBrussels (dpa) – The EU wants to better protect journalists and media companies from political interference. According to a press release, negotiators from the European Parliament and EU member states agreed on the so-called European Media Freedom Act in Brussels on Friday. One of the aims of the project is to ensure greater transparency in the industry, for example in the ownership structure of media companies or the allocation of state advertising funds.Especially in countries such as Hungary and Poland, where the state has a direct influence on the media, the EU believes that this has become a major problem in recent years. It wants to remedy this with the law. However, publishers had expressed concern before the agreement was reached that certain provisions threatened rather than protected press freedom.German newspaper and magazine publishers maintained their critical stance on Friday. The Federal Association of Digital Publishers and Newspaper Publishers (BDZV) and the Media Association of the Free Press (MVFP) stated: ""While the press is struggling with economic, regulatory and competitive challenges, the EU is tightening a corset that does not address any of the problems and instead jeopardises press freedom.""Germany's Minister of State for the Media, Claudia Roth (Greens), on the other hand, called the EU agreement ""very good news."" According to her, the law ensures that freedom and diversity of the media in Europe will be strengthened and safeguarded. She also referred to the changes that had been achieved, which were important for publishers, public broadcasting and journalists in Germany. Roth assured that the well-functioning German media system would not be interfered with.According to the agreement, the EU states must guarantee effective protection for journalists in the future. In particular, spying on journalists is to be prevented. However, there could be exceptions to this. The national supervisory authorities should also work together in a new committee for media services at EU level, the agreement proposes.There are also to be clearer rules for the relationship between media companies and large online platforms such as Facebook, which belongs to the Meta group, or Google. ""The agreement marks an important milestone for media freedom and a great moment for safeguarding the rights of journalists in the EU,"" said German MEP Sabine Verheyen, who led the negotiations for Parliament.

EU agrees on law to strengthen media freedom and protect journalists,"The European Union wants to better protect journalists and media companies from political influence and has agreed on the so-called European Media Freedom Act. While the safeguards offered by the law have been mostly welcomed, it does not come without flaws â€“ and issues across the European media landscape remain.The EU has sealed an agreement on new legislation relating to freedom of the media, which seeks to increase transparency on the ownership of media companies and on institutional advertising, to better protect journalists and their sources as well as to strengthen the independence of public media.Especially in countries such as Hungary and Poland, where the state has a direct influence on the media, the EU believes that this has become a major problem in recent years. It wants to remedy this with the new legislation. ""The agreement reached [...] is a testament to our commitment to fostering free and pluralistic media. For the first time, there will be safeguards in European law,"" German MEP Sabine Verheyen (EPP), who spearheaded the text through parliament, said.VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, vice president of the European Commission for values and transparency, said the EU was ""not regulating the media, we are regulating the space for mediaâ€.German newspaper and magazine publishers, however, maintained a previously critical stance. The Federal Association of Digital Publishers and Newspaper Publishers (BDZV) and the Media Association of the Free Press (MVFP) said that ""while the press is struggling with economic, regulatory and competitive challenges, the EU is tightening a corset that does not address any of the problems and instead endangers press freedomâ€.Use of spyware at the heart of the debateThe major stumbling block that caused the negotiations to extend into the final weeks of the Spanish presidency of the Council of the EU was the inclusion of a clause that would have opened up the ban on spying on journalists or their sources for reasons of ""national security"", an article rejected by the European Parliament.According to the agreement, the EU member states must guarantee effective protection for journalists in future. In particular, spying on journalists is to be prevented. However, there could be exceptions to this. Several member states had previously insisted on allowing exceptions to the spying ban in the name of national security, causing great concern among professional associations and other press freedom advocates. In the end, the compromise text no longer included a reference to national security, Romanian MEP Ramona Strugariu (Renew) said.After intense ""lobbying"" by press associations and a battle that threatened to derail the negotiations, the law does not include this exception but reserves it to a recital and makes a general mention of ""respecting the responsibilities of the Member States"", sources close to the negotiations said. The European Parliament considered it a victory.Verheyen said any surveillance, such as the use of spyware in journalists' devices, would only be possible for serious crimes and if there was a judicial decision. ""Not just for everything they can call national security,"" she said.Legal and judicial politicians arrive at the headquarters of Telewizja Polska (TVP) in Warsaw. Tusk's new pro-European government has begun a major clean-up of the public media. Photo: Pawel Supernak/PAP/dpaEuropean media landscape in perpetual crisis The media freedom law also contains some safeguards to protect the independence of public media, such as the requirement that the criteria for appointing and dismissing senior positions, the duration of their mandates and sufficient funding to fulfil their mission must be established by law in advance.In Slovenia, for example, a long-awaited media reform bill is currently in public consultation. An important new feature is the transparency of ownership, which should also lead to stronger media pluralism. In an interview with TV Slovenia, Minister of Culture Asta VreÄko stressed that the bill follows both the European Media Freedom Act and the Artificial Intelligence Act, which will underpin media regulation in the future.Despite the agreed safeguards, the media landscape in several other EU countries has recently seen significant transformations.Poland's new pro-EU government on Wednesday launched a reform of state media and sacked their management, as right-wing lawmakers staged a sit-in to protest the changes and public broadcasts were interrupted. The shakeup comes a week after the election of Prime Minister Donald Tusk and after eight years of rule by the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) party. State-owned media under the PiS were regularly accused of biased reporting, transmitting government propaganda and launching verbal attacks on the opposition.Swiss media company Ringier – which owns Romania's Libertatea daily and the Gazeta Sporturilor (GSP) publication – earlier this month announced plans to cut jobs at Libertatea, citing the increasing shift to online media. Journalists of the affected dailies claim to have been pressured by management into submitting any articles on online betting companies – who are powerful in the Balkans and are a major source of ad revenues – for vetting ahead of publication.Commenting on the agreed EU media freedom law, the chairperson of the EU Affairs Committee in the Chamber of Deputies of the Romanian Parliament, Stefan Musoiu, recalled that in Romania, freedom of expression and a free press came about with the 1989 Revolution, following supreme sacrifices that allowed the people to benefit from increasingly promising prospects within the EU and NATO.The official profile of platform X on the screen of a smartphone. Photo: Monika Skolimowska/dpaTighter grip on online platformsAnother crucial point in the legislation is the issue of moderation of journalistic content by online platforms. There should also be clearer rules for the relationship between media companies and large online platforms such as Facebook, which belongs to the Meta group, or Google.The European Commission has decided to open an infringement procedure against social media platform X and its owner Elon Musk – an unprecedented investigation, the first under the new Digital Services Act (DSA). It will look at all the illegal practices the tycoon may be responsible for, including misleading design and serious gaps in transparency. In October, the Commission warned X that there is no room in Europe for illegal content and disinformation on social media.Meeting with representatives of Reporters Without Borders in Brussels in October, Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said among the main problems in Bulgaria is misinformation and not the lack of freedom of speech, as there has been significant progress in this respect in the last couple of years. ""Apart from changes in Bulgarian laws, European legislation can help us a lot in this respect,"" Denkov added.EU services will now proceed to gather evidence, conduct interviews and carry out inspections before deciding whether to ask X for new remedies or to find the path of compromise. There is no fixed deadline for the investigation under the DSA. Last but not least, the agreed media freedom law also provides for the establishment of a new European Media Council, made up of representatives of the national regulatory authorities of the 27 EU Member States, to provide a stricter framework for mergers in this sector. This body would be responsible for issuing a non-binding opinion on these operations from the point of view of their effect on pluralism.The draft European Media Freedom Act will become law once formally adopted by the European Parliament and member states. EU countries can introduce stricter or more detailed national rules than those in the law.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
"Europe in brief: Highest per capita number of EU asylum applications in Austria, breakthrough in EU asylum reform and agreement to relax EU budgetary rules","According to Eurostat, Austria recorded the highest number of first-time asylum applications per capita in September 2023. The country ranks third in the EU for unaccompanied minors. The European Parliament and the member states have reached an agreement on the sweeping reform of the asylum and migration policy. The EU-27 agreed to relax budgetary rules.Austria records highest number of asylum applications per capita in the EUBrussels/Luxembourg (APA) – In September 2023, 98,240 people applied for asylum in one of the 27 EU countries for the first time. This is ten per cent more than in September 2022 (89,370), as the European statistics authority Eurostat stated on Thursday. Austria recorded the highest number of first-time applications per capita in September 2023 (87.6 applicants per 100,000 inhabitants, up from 72.4 in August), followed by Cyprus (79.3). Austria ranked third in the EU for unaccompanied minors.Across the EU, the number of first-time asylum applicants was 21.9 per 100,000 inhabitants. The lowest rate was observed in Hungary (0.03). In addition, there were 5,265 repeat applicants across the EU, a decrease of 20 per cent compared to September 2022 (6,555).As in the previous months, the highest number of first-time asylum applications in September 2023 were made in Germany (27,885), Spain (13,395), France (13,100) and Italy (11,930), accounting for 67 per cent of all first-time applications in the EU. Across the EU, Syrians made up the largest group of asylum seekers (19,220 first-time applicants). They were followed by Turks (10,200), Afghans (9,215), Venezuelans (5,290) and Colombians (5,230).4,055 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in the EU for the first time in September 2023, most of them from Syria (1,575) and Afghanistan (980). The EU countries which received the most asylum applications from unaccompanied minors were the Netherlands (910), followed by Germany (775), Austria (705), Bulgaria (490) and Greece (380). (21 December 2023)EU reaches agreement on asylum and migration reformBrussels (Belga) – Following a final night of negotiations, the European Parliament and member states reached an agreement on a sweeping reform of the European Union's asylum and migration policy on Wednesday. The reform aims to tighten existing rules and curb illegal migration. This was announced by European Commission Vice-President Margaritis Schinas.After years of discussions and a final sprint with two days and two nights of negotiations, member state representatives and the European Parliament have finally agreed on the legal texts that make up the reform. The reform still needs to be approved by the Parliament's plenary, but that is usually a formality. The text has the support of ""a majority around the centre, with socialists, centrists and conservatives,"" negotiator Fabienne Keller (Renew) explained at a press conference.The agreement has the support of ""a majority around the centre, with socialists, centrists and conservatives.""MEP Fabienne Keller (Renew Europe)The reform includes tighter controls on the arrival of migrants in the European Union. This will include standardised procedures at external borders. People coming from countries considered relatively safe will be dealt with more harshly. Until a decision is taken on their asylum application, they will have to wait in detention-like reception centres. A so-called solidarity mechanism should distribute people seeking protection among member states. If countries do not want to take in refugees, they should offer support, for instance in the form of payments.""We finally have a binding solidarity mechanism. This means that all member states are finally taking responsibility, not just some,"" said negotiator Tomas TobÃ© (EPP). ""I strongly believe that this will restore trust between member states, as well as that of citizens.""""We finally have a binding solidarity mechanism. [...] I strongly believe this will restore trust between member states, as well as that of citizens."" MEP Tomas TobÃ© (EPP)Specifically, the solidarity mechanism to which member states have committed should consist of a minimum of 30,000 redeployments, as well as â‚¬600 million in financial support. ""If there is not enough in the solidarity pot, the European Commission can ask for additional solidarity,"" explained negotiator Juan Fernando LÃ³pez Aguilar (S&D). â€œIf that is still not enough, we can move on to mandatory measures.â€The agreement must now be developed into conclusive legal texts. The aim is to get them through the European Parliament before the European elections in June. Member states will then also have to formally give the green light, and this should happen under the presidency of Belgium, which takes over the torch from Spain in January.""I wish the Belgian Presidency every success in finalising the work and getting these texts across the finish line,"" said European Parliament president Roberta Metsola. ""Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo assured me last week that he is ready to take up the dossier.""

Online posts push euroscepticism with false claims about animal diseases in Serbia,"In the summer of 2023, Serbia faced an outbreak of African swine fever among domestic pigs, which forced the authorities to euthanise tens of thousands of animals. In late November, Belgrade announced a wave of avian influenza among wild birds. Despite the facts, a false claim circulated on social media in Bulgarian that these and other animal diseases do not exist in Serbia, which is not a member of the European Union. The posts promote a false narrative suggesting that Brussels has concocted fictitious animal diseases and that they are therefore only found in EU countries.â€œHey, my friend, I was just wondering why Serbia doesn't have African swine fever, blue tongue, bird flu or mad cow disease? Because they're not in the EU!â€ reads the Facebook post.Since November 24, 2023, it has been shared more than 2,400 times. According to comments below the post, certain users seem to believe that these diseases do not exist. ""BULGARIANS, DO NOT BELIEVE ANYONE THERE ARE NO SUCH DISEASES NEITHER IN HUMANS NOR IN ANIMALS!!"" writes one user. ""They don't exist in Bulgaria either,"" comments another. â€œEU Commissioners spread â€˜diseasesâ€™ among domestic and wild meat animals through EU agriculture and food ministers,â€ another comment reads. However, others point out that the claims are misleading and provide links to recent news reports about outbreaks of infectious diseases among animals in Serbia.False claims fuel eurosceptic narrative AFP found that posts with the very same text were already shared in 2019, including this one posted on a Facebook group called â€œCoalition Exit EU and NATO"". The post fits into a broader narrative that presents the EU as the leading cause of Bulgaria's difficulties. AFP has already debunked false claims that the EU has banned domestic livestock, authorised the concealed use of insects in food products and forced Bulgaria to close its coal-powered power plants. Some of the comments on the Facebook post repeat a falsehood about former EU commissioner and Bulgarian Foreign Minister Mariya Gabriel. AFP has already debunked the claim that Gabrielâ€™s husband had worked for the French laboratory that confirmed the European Unionâ€™s first-ever goat plague outbreak. Also known as peste des petits ruminants (PPR), it is a highly contagious viral disease affecting animals such as sheep and goats.  What the data showsPublic data shows that Serbia has encountered three out of four of the diseases mentioned in the false claim on Facebook. On a global level, information regarding epidemiological situations can be found at the World Animal Health Information System (WAHIS), which is managed by the Paris-based intergovernmental World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).  According to its website: â€œWhen an important epidemiological event pertaining to terrestrial or aquatic animals occurs in a WOAH Member, the Member must inform WOAH by sending an immediate notificationâ€  (archived).""WOAH Members have an obligation to submit information on their animal health situation,"" the organisation's website explains (archived). Serbia, along with more than 180 other countries, is a WOAH member (archived).https://youtu.be/kWV64ke6A18AFP consulted WAHIS and applied ""Serbia"" to filter the results. As we can see from the results below, there are reports on African swine fever, Avian influence and bluetongue disease (archived):Screenshot from WAHIS database with ""Serbia"" filter. Annotated by AFP on November 28, 2023.Each event report includes details on the date, location, diseases, animal species, test used, and the laboratory that performed it. Let's explain this in more detail.Ongoing outbreak of African swine fever in SerbiaThe WOAH describes African swine fever (ASF) as â€œa highly contagious viral disease of domestic and wild pigs, whose mortality rate can reach 100%â€ (archived).The first cases of ASF in the EU were reported in 2014, and the disease spread among domestic or wild pigs in many countries, including Bulgaria, in 2018.In August 2023, the Serbian language versions of the BBC and DW reported recent cases of ASF in Serbia (archived links here and here). The first cases date back to 2019 (archived). The Serbian agriculture ministry said in late September 2023 that 4,348 cases of African swine fever had been confirmed in the country and 54,243 pigs had been euthanised (archived).â€œSince the first appearance of ASF in Serbia in 2019, the epizootic situation [an outbreak of disease affecting many animals of one kind at the same time] this year is the most unfavourable,â€ reads this June 2023 article from the Scientific Veterinary Institute in Novi Sad (archived link to the article). On Serbia's Veterinary Directorate webpage, there is a â€œlist of decisions on the declaration of an infected and endangered area of the ASF- 2023â€. The list includes 77 infected localities (archived link). According to the latest available follow-up report on the ASF situation in Serbia -- from September 8, 2023 at the WOAH website -- the outbreak is considered â€œongoingâ€ (archived). The EUâ€™s Animal Disease Information System (ADIS) provides animal disease information â€œas notified by the countries listed in the documentâ€. Again, Serbia is one of the countries that have reported ASF among domestic pigs (page 1 of the PDF), according to the last summary report as of the end of November 2023 (archived).â€œAfrican swine fever (ASF) continued to spread rapidly, affecting primarily small holdings in rural areas and causing considerable economic damage,â€ reads the latest EC report on EU Enlargement policy regarding Serbia (page 141 of the pdf file). According to the WAHIS database, as of November 28, 2023, there are 69 reports of ASF with ongoing status all over the world.

AI viruses have also been isolated, although less frequently, from mammalian species, including humans.â€ WOAH also explains that ""this complex disease is caused by viruses divided into multiple subtypes (i.e. H5N1, H5N3, H5N8 etc.) whose genetic characteristics rapidly evolve"" (archived ). ""Based on the data reported to WOAH, spread [of AI] is lowest in September, begins to rise in October, and peaks in February,"" reads this report from the WOAH.According to the WAHIS database, there are recent reports of AI in Hungary, Sweden, Germany, Norway, Romania, Brazil, the UK, the US, Ecuador and Serbia, where there are cases among wild birds (swans and cranes infected with H5N1, archived link here ). In the past, in Serbia, there have also been reported cases among poultry (H5N1, H5N2, H5N8, etc.)Screenshot from the WAHIS database with filters applied ""Disease: Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (poultry) (Inf. c)"" , ""Disease: Highly pathogenic influenza A viruses (inf. c) (nepticians including wild birds ) (2017)"" and ""Country: Serbia"".

What's in store for the European Union in 2024?,"In 2024, elections will take centre stage â€“ not only domestically but also EU-wide as well as in the USA and Russia. The Union is looking at elections in early June. Many of the present discussions revolving around migration, enlargement or the budget will remain hot-button issues. The beginning of the year is marked by the Belgian presidency of the Council of the European Union beginning as well as an extraordinary EU Council Summit. What are the individual countries looking at?From January 1, Belgium will take over the EU Council presidency from Spain for the first half of 2024. This will be the main focus of the federal national government. With the political agreement on the Pact on Migration and Asylum reached and parliamentary approval of the blocâ€™s budgetary rules likely, ministers consider themselves to have a big responsibility on the EU stage. The Belgian presidency will also have to prepare the debate on future enlargement.Spain, concluding its presidency, will start 2024 with a newly launched left-wing government which had been difficult to form. To unblock governability, Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has accepted a law to amnesty those involved in the Catalan independence process who have outstanding accounts with justice.This amnesty will set the political agenda for 2024. The European Commission already stated it will carry out a compliance check with the rule of law. Spain is also facing the possible return of former Catalan president Carles Puigdemont to the country and the potential protests this may spark.Elections, elections, electionsBetween June 6 and 9, the citizens of the 27 EU member states will go to the polls and vote in the European Elections. Many anticipate a stark move to the right in the European Parliament. In France, the subject of migration risks being at the heart of the campaign for the European election, which will also serve as a test, two years into President Emmanuel Macron's second five-year term. The debate will pit the far-right Rassemblement National (National Rally) party, supported by Marine Le Pen and generally opposed to immigration, against Renaissance which, with several centrist parties, supports Macron. Renaissance had to make concessions to the right to get a more balanced but still controversial immigration law adopted by parliament on December 20. Besides politics, France is hosting the Olympic Games from July 26 to August 11 and is also looking at the reopening of the Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris on December 8.Spain may face a similar fate: There, the right-wing opposition may try to turn the EU elections into a first plebiscite for the newly formed government. The control of irregular migration, shortage of affordable housing, high youth unemployment or the control of the public deficit will be on the table in 2024 Spain.The campaign for the European elections in Slovenia will very probably focus on issues that are most pressing to citizens: In addition to the cost of living and inflation, which is currently one of the highest in the Euro area, these will most certainly include migration, the (non)functioning of the Schengen area as well as topics like the  assistance to Ukraine and the EUâ€™s stance in view of the resolution of the Middle East conflict.Besides the European elections, the US presidential election on November 5, 2024 will mark an important event in terms of foreign policy. If Donald Trump were to be elected again, it is rumoured that US support for Ukraine could be scaled back, which would play into the hands of Russian President Vladimir Putin. It is questionable whether the Europeans can and want to provide enough support for Ukraine in the long term without the USA in order to counter Putin's expansionist endeavours.In Ukraine, the presidential election originally planned for the beginning of March was cancelled due to the continuing martial law as the war with Russia is still ongoing. At the beginning of November, president Volodymyr Zelensky emphasised ""that elections are not appropriate now.""Russia however will hold its presidential elections in March 2024. Putin's opponents are repeatedly complaining that the election commission is rejecting the registration of candidates claiming formal errors, such as anti-Kremlin journalist Yekaterina Duntsova's initiative group recently. It is considered certain that Putin will emerge victorious in his fifth run at the presidency. The Russian president had the constitution amended specifically in order to be able to run again. According to the current version of the constitution, the 71-year-old can run for the last time in 2030.A woman casts her vote for the Berlin House of Representatives election and throws her ballot paper into the ballot box. Photo: Wolfgang Kumm/dpaDomestic elections around Europe in 2024In addition to the upcoming European Elections, multiple European countries ask their citizens to vote in a range of domestic elections, too. In Spain, regional elections will be held in Galicia which is a stronghold of the Partido Popular (PP) and in Basque Country which is home to parties supporting PM SÃ¡nchez.In Belgium, citizens will vote in federal and regional elections. In October, citizens will be called to the ballot box a second time to vote in local elections. Romania is looking at an atypical election year. In 2024, citizens are expected to vote in four types of elections – presidential, parliamentary, local and European elections. In Slovakia too, 2024 will be an important year in terms of domestic politics. In spring, citizens will elect a new head of state after five years. The alpine republic of Austria calls citizens to the ballot boxes to vote in several state and city elections. The country will also elect a new parliament in 2024.Germany is also facing several types of elections, among those regional elections in which state parliaments will be elected, as well as elections of district and municipal councils as well as mayors. Besides politics, Germany will host the European Championships of handball and football in January and July/August respectively.North Macedonia is looking at both presidential and parliamentary elections next year. The presidential elections will be held on April 24, while the potential second round is expected to be held alongside the parliamentary elections on May 8.Workers glue the new facade of the European Union offices with the slogan ""EU with you"" in Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia, 24 September 2021. Photo: EPA-EFE/Georgi LicovskiGreen light for EU enlargement means domestic restructuring Countries holding candidate status are aiming to further pave their way to become a member state.In North Macedonia for example, efforts include constitutional amendments in order to include minorities in the preamble. The country also aims to implement reforms related to the rule of law, public administration or protection of members of minority communities. At the EU Council summit in December, it was concluded that the EU is ready to complete the opening stage of accession talks with the country – as soon as the commitment to adopt the constitutional amendments is implemented. However, this amendment remains blocked in parliament for now, with possible shifts only expected after the elections. Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), which received candidate status a year ago, is coming out of 2023 with a conditional green light to open negotiations when the necessary level of compliance with membership criteria is achieved. The Commission will report about this to the EU Council by March 2024. To be able to negotiate, the country needs to adopt reform laws at the beginning of next year which would strengthen the fight against corruption, build legal certainty and provide arguments that the country is making progress in the implementation of 14 key priorities. On the other hand, European leaders called on the authorities of the Republika Srpska entity to withdraw disputed laws, which will cause BiH to regress in terms of fundamental freedoms. Areas of concern are a law that criminalises defamation, then the law on 'foreign agents' that provides for special surveillance for non-governmental organisations that are financed from abroad, as well as the law that the decisions of the high representative will not be implemented in this entity.Next year, Albania awaits the opening of negotiations for the first group of chapters. In December, the country completed the screening process of harmonising legislation with the European Union as the first stage of negotiations that were opened in July 2022. Prime Minister Edi Rama views making rapid progress towards the EU as an imminent challenge, stressing that Albania today possesses over 50 percent of the capacity to be considered ready for membership in the European Union. While appreciating the work of the Albanian negotiators, he emphasised that ""we are still at the beginning of the process.""The euro sculpture by artist Ottmar HÃ¶rl shines in the evening in front of the bank towers.

After the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council in early December, Romanian officials announced that Austria had softened its position and agreed to Romania joining the Schengen Area for air travel.Bulgariaâ€™s initial plan was to join the Eurozone in 2024. However, in February 2023, then caretaker finance minister Rositsa Velkova said the country had not met all commitments it made as it entered the EUâ€™s Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II) and the inflation criterion, which is why it was moving the target date for accession to January 1, 2025.Bulgaria has adopted an action plan for the transition away from the Bulgarian Lev currency. A steering committee in which Eurosceptics play a key role collected enough votes in favour of a petition for a referendum asking Bulgarians to back keeping the Lev as the only legal tender until 2043. The number of votes backing the initiative made the referendum imminent but in early July 2023 parliament rejected it, arguing that the wording of the question was unconstitutional. Vazrazhdane, a nationalist and far-right party, took the matter to the Constitutional Court where the case is still pending.  This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: EU leaders pay tribute to late Jacques Delors,"Former European Commission President Jacques Delors has died at the age of 98. German business sectors are pessimistic about the year ahead. Spain advocates the creation of a special mission in the Red Sea in the face of attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels.European tributes to Jacques Delors, ""builder"" of EuropeParis (AFP) – On Wednesday, European Union and a number of national leaders hailed Jacques Delors as a â€œbuilderâ€ of Europe. The former President of the European Commission had died at the age of 98.He was ""a visionary who made our Europe stronger"" and whose ""work (...) has shaped entire generations of Europeans,"" Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X. ""His life's work is a united, dynamic and prosperous European Union,"" she added.For US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Jacques Delors ""transformed Europe through tireless service to the idea of a Europe whole and free."" Blinken stressed that he continued to believe â€œin this vision and the strength of our transatlantic bond.â€Jacques Delors has ""gone down in history as one of the builders of our Europe,"" said European Council President Charles Michel, describing Delors as ""a great Frenchman and a great European."" (28 December)The head of the IW cites the abrupt end to state subsidies for electric cars as the most recent example of a lack of predictability for companies. Photo: Hendrik Schmidt/dpaGerman economy pessimistic about coming yearCologne (dpa) – The mood in the German economy is gloomy: many major sectors are pessimistic about the coming year. ""It is rare that we see such weak momentum two years in a row. A year with a poor outlook is followed by another weak year,"" Michael HÃ¼ther, head of the German Economic Institute (IW), told dpa. The weakness of the global economy, interest rate hikes and uncertainties regarding the federal budget are depressing the outlook for 2024. This is also likely to have consequences for the labour market. Last year, the energy crisis had weighed on sentiment.According to the IW's annual survey, 23 out of 47 business associations responding expect a decline in production or business at their member companies in the coming year. Fifteen industry associations expect economic activity to remain the same, while only nine anticipate a higher level of production. A year earlier, 30 associations had expected a decline and 13 had anticipated an increase.No more reliable framework conditionsIn the November/December survey, 22 associations stated that they expected investment to fall. ""The last time the mood on this point was worse was in 2009, the year of the financial crisis,"" explained HÃ¼ther. In his view, the main problem is the lack of predictability for companies. As the most recent example, the IW boss cited the abrupt end to the state subsidies for electric cars. ""We are no longer a reliable location in terms of conditions, and there is no prospect that reliable framework conditions will develop to tackle the important transformation tasks in the context of climate and demographic change by the end of the decade,"" said HÃ¼ther.In the eyes of HÃ¼ther, one important reason for this is the so-called debt brake, ""the design of which no longer fits the times. We urgently need a reform, because even another government will not be able to cope with the current concept.""According to the employer-oriented institute, the unemployment rate could rise slightly to 6 per cent on average in the coming year. ""The stability on the German labour market that has been apparent for a long time will no longer be seen in the year 2024,"" said HÃ¼ther. ""We will no longer see a further increase in employment, partly due to the increasing shortage of skilled labour, which is limiting the supply of labour."" According to the survey, only 5 associations expect employment to increase in the coming year, while 23 industry representatives anticipate a decline, including banks, savings banks and the construction industry. 19 associations expect stable figures.Real estate sector expects business results to decline significantlyThe real estate sector, among others, expects business results to decline significantly in the coming year. High construction costs and increased interest rates for construction loans are dampening demand, and real estate prices have fallen. The construction industry and building trade expect business to be slightly weaker than this year.Important export-oriented industrial sectors, such as mechanical engineering, are suffering from the weakness of the global economy. The industry association VDMA recently lowered its forecast for 2024. The textile and fashion industry is more pessimistic as well, having felt the effects of the consumers' reluctance to spend this year as a result of high inflation, among other things.The few optimists who expect business to improve somewhat in 2024 include the automotive industry, research-based pharmaceutical companies, the skilled trades and tourism, which is benefiting from the return of people's desire to travel following the coronavirus pandemic.

Misleading screenshot revives false claim of EU ban on the word 'Christmas',"The EU Commission issued guidelinesÂ in 2021Â for its employees on how to use inclusive language in official communications, but then quickly withdrew them again in the face of a backlash in media and social media in several languages where the message was misrepresented. A screenshot of an article dating from that time is circulating again in many languages in December 2023, but the 2021 publication date is not visible. Contrary to what posts in SerbianÂ  sharing the screenshot claim, the EU does not ""want to ban the vast majority of the population from using certain words connected with Christianity."" The guidelines explained how to reflect a fair representation of the entire population of the EU, including people who do not celebrate Christmas on December 25.""Although Christianity is the biggest religion in the EU, they want to forbid the large majority of the population from using certain words connected with Christianity,"" claims a post in Serbian on Telegram published on December 4, 2023, on a channel which has repeatedly published false information checked by AFP like here, here and here. ""The EU Commissioner 'for equality' believes that words like 'Christmas' or Christian names like Mary are discriminatory in the newly published 'guidelines', the Berliner Zeitung reports,"" the post reads below a screenshot of an article with the headline in English ""EU guide considers Christmas and Mary to be discriminatory"".An image reverse search for results published in December 2023 shows that this screenshot and claim are circulating in many languages on various social media platforms in Croatian, English, Polish and Hungarian. The earliest post that AFP could find was published in Russian on Telegram on December 3, 2023, on a channel that has previously shared false information. For example, it shared a video claiming to  show Gaza bombed by Israel when it actually showed Ariha in Syria bombed by the Syrian regime and its Russian ally.A further search led to the original article published in the Berliner Zeitung  on its website in 2021 in German. Neither the publication date (December 1, 2021) nor the author's name appear on the screenshot. The false claim that the EU had ""banned the use of the word Christmas in any context"" based on a misrepresentation of guidelines published in 2021 had circulated at the time in Serbian and Croatian. AFP debunked the claim here. The document in question does not impose a ban on the use of the word ""Christmas"", but recommends an alternative when referring to end-of-year holiday celebrations while respecting the diversity of people living in the European Union.The photo in the article and the screenshot show Helena Dalli, the EU Commissioner for Equality whose mandate ends in 2024. The photo was taken on October 20, 2021, during a debate on the rise of right-wing extremism and racism in Europe in a plenary session at the European Parliament in Strasbourg, AFP archives show.Dalli announced the publication of the guide for inclusive communication in the executive body of the European Union on October 26, 2021, but the document was withdrawn on November 30 the same year in face of the controversy that arose over the misleading claim that the EU was, through this document, ""banning the use of the word Christmas"".What did the now-withdrawn guidelines say?AFP obtained in 2021 a copy of the guidelines published by the EU Commission with the title: ""#Union of equality Guidelines of the European Commission for inclusive communication."" ""The purpose of this document is to set common standards for inclusive communication and provide practical examples and advice to all colleagues from the Commission,"" the introduction states.It adds that ""the recommendations in this document can be useful for creating any type of communication material, including press materials (press releases and questions and answers), informational content and infographics, posts and visuals for social media, training materials and presentations, materials used in internal communication, speeches and texts, briefings.""The document is, therefore, not intended for member states, politicians or people living in the European Union, but simply makes a series of recommendations about the way in which employees should communicate on behalf of the Commission.The document does not forbid the use of the word ""Christmas"", but recommends phrases such as ""for those celebrating Christmas, Hanukah..."", and saying things like ""holiday times can be stressful""  instead of Christmas time can be stressful"".The claim that the EU is forbidding the use of ""Christian names"" is a misunderstanding. A ""Christian name"" is an old-fashioned term for ""a given name"" in English. The recommendation, therefore, was to avoid using the term ""Christian name"", and replacing it with other terms such as""first name, forename or given name"". The document also recommended avoiding the use of names only connected to one religion but varying them to reflect diversity.EU Commissioner Dalli has wished a merry Christmas publicly on X (ex-Twitter) in December 2020, 2021 and 2022. She also marked other religious celebrations like Ramadan and Chanukah.The EU is a growing target of disinformation, as the Union prepares for the EU Parliament elections in 2024. EU-related false information is tracked by theÂ European Digital Media Observatory's (EDMO) Task ForceÂ and by fact-checking organizations. AFP in Slovakia debunked for instance the claim that proposed changes in the EU's functioning would turn the Union intoÂ ""a military federation"". In Bulgaria, images from a fringe anti-EU rally by a small French far-right party without any representation in the French Parliament wereÂ misrepresented as showing an alleged anti-EU feeling in France.

Europe in brief: EU adds Russian diamond giant to sanctions list,"The EU Council has added diamond giant PJSC Alrosa to its sanctions list against Russia over its war of aggression against Ukraine. Bulgaria and Romania will join the Schengen zone by the end of March 2024. Belgium has taken over the rotating presidency of the EU Council.EU sanctions Russian diamond giant AlrosaBrussels (ANSA) - The EU Council has added PJSC Alrosa and its CEO Pavel Alekseevich Marinychev to its blacklist of individuals and entities subject to restrictive measures. Alrosa, owned by the Russian state, is the largest diamond mining company in the world and accounts for over 90 percent of all Russian diamond production. ""The company constitutes an important part of an economic sector that is providing substantial revenue to the government of the Russian Federation,â€ the EU Council said.The measure is in addition to restrictions imposed as part of the 12th sanctions package decided just before the Christmas holidays which includes a ban on Russian diamonds in coordination with the G7. In total, the EU's restrictive measures against actions that threaten or undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence now apply to almost 1,950 persons and entities.Designated persons are subject to an asset freeze and EU citizens and companies are prohibited from making funds available to them. Natural persons are also subject to a travel ban, preventing them from entering or transiting EU territories. Russian diamond exports totalled revenues of about 4 billion dollars in 2022. The EU import ban on natural and synthetic diamonds exported from Russia came into force on January 1, while the import ban on Russian diamonds processed in third countries will be phased in by September.

However, with the new fiscal rules and the migration pact agreed during the Spanish presidency just before Christmas, Belgium will not have any major legislative projects pending, although it will have to deal with Hungary's veto of EU help for Ukraine.Specifically, it will have to overcome Hungary's rejection of the new package of 50 billion euros in aid to Ukraine between 2024 and 2027 and the increase in the EU budget for that period. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's ultra-nationalist government is making it conditional on Brussels unblocking the 21 billion in EU funds still frozen due to the EUâ€™s rule-of-law dispute with Hungary.

Romania's and Bulgaria's Schengen accession,"After more than ten years of waiting: Bulgaria and Romania have been given the green light to join Europe's free-travel Schengen area by air and sea from March 2024. However, some restrictions will remain in place.On December 30, 2023, the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the EU announced that Romania and Bulgaria will be partially integrated into the Schengen area of free movement in March 2024. Romania and Bulgaria, both EU members since 2007, were rejected at the end of 2022 from joining the vast Schengen zone, within which more than 400 million people can travel freely without internal border controls. Although the European Commission and the European Parliament have been assuring for years that both countries are prepared to enter Schengen, Austria and the Netherlands blocked their accession until now. Following complicated negotiations, Bulgaria and Romania reached an agreement with Austria on joining the Schengen area for air and sea crossings to begin with, but not by land. For years, Vienna vetoed both countries, saying that Austria had to host a disproportionate number of undocumented immigrants as a result of poorly protected external Schengen borders. Together, the three countries will later agree on the date of when to end controls on Romaniaâ€™s and Bulgariaâ€™s land borders.The Netherlands blocked Bulgariaâ€™s entry for more than 10 years over concerns about the rule of law. The Dutch Parliament voted on December 21, 2023 to approve the position of the countryâ€™s government in favour of Bulgariaâ€™s Schengen entry.Â Bulgaria and Romania: Criticism over two-step accession Austriaâ€™s reluctance to give a green light to the Schengen accession for the land borders has outraged some Bulgarian businesses. Vasil Velev, chair of the Board of the National Representative Association of Industrial Capital, said in an interview on national TV that his organisation demands a stronger reaction from the Bulgarian public and the government. â€After all the efforts we made and meeting all requirements for Schengen entry, why arenâ€™t we equal with the rest,â€ Velev said. He argued that levers should be sought which would give political players in Austria a motive to change their position.Austrian companies based in Bulgaria are currently subject to tax audits. Bulgariaâ€™s Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Assen Vasilev has assured that the ongoing investigations by the Bulgarian tax authorities against the supermarket chain Billa and the petrol stations of OMV are unrelated to the Austrian position. â€œThe tax investigators are currently scrutinising at least 500 to 700 companies,â€ the minister said.Â The minister did confirm that trucks that are going to and coming from Austria go through extra-stringent checks at the border, which is done at Austriaâ€™s request. â€œOf course, this leads to tensions at the border crossing points, especially with Turkey. Thatâ€™s why we are planning more staff and more X-ray machines for lorry transports over the year,â€ he said. In Romania, the partial accession decision was welcomed by the ruling coalition and the business environment but criticised by the opposition. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu described the decision as a big step forward, stressing that the Romanian Government will continue to work both politically and technically to complete the process this year.Â The National Council of Small and Medium Sized Private Enterprises in Romania (CNIPMMR) argued that the measure will facilitate trade by lowering transport costs for Romanian exported goods and commodities. It will also contribute to creating a climate of confidence and strengthening Romaniaâ€™s image as a stable country within the EU.Â On the other hand, several Romanian MEPs voiced their dissatisfaction with this partial Schengen accession. MEP Eugen Tomac believes that the European Commission and the Spanish Presidency of the EU played the â€œcompromise cardâ€ with Austria, while MEP Dacian CioloÈ™ who is also former European Commissioner for Agriculture pointed out that Romanians are treated as second-class European citizens. â€œ'The way we are now entering Schengen, in half and with absurd conditions (...) will deepen the feeling that we are not fully considered Europeans. We continue to depend on the goodwill of Austria and the other member states for a right we have had for 12 years. Secondly, we do not have a clear timetable for this hypothetical second decision,"" CioloÈ™ said.Migration and the EUâ€™s external borderThe European Commission has promised to support Bulgaria and Romania in protecting the EUâ€™s external borders. Bulgaria, in particular, will receive significant financial support from the European Commission, as well as operational and technical assistance from the European border agency, Frontex, especially at the border with Turkey and Serbia.â€œAustriaâ€™s demands will be met,â€ wrote Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer on X at the end of December. â€œThe Frontex mission in Romania and Bulgaria will be increased and both countries will receive more EU funds to implement robust external border protection.â€Bulgarian Foreign Minister Mariya Gabriel hoped that a date for the abolition of land border controls would be confirmed in 2024. The Government of Bulgaria, for its part, is committed to strictly applying the Dublin Regulation, which includes the readmission of people registered as asylum seekers in the country, in accordance with the Community rules on first-country responsibility. Meanwhile, Croatiaâ€™s Interior Minister Davor BoÅ¾inoviÄ‡ told the Croatian News Agency HINA that since Croatia joined the Schengen area in 2023 over 1,850 people smugglers were arrested by the Croatian police. He added that this â€œis an increase of more than 90 percent to last yearâ€. BoÅ¾inoviÄ‡ said that Croatia's Schengen accession brought changes to policing, adding that the police were prepared for the accession and are dealing with all challenges more than successfully.Austriaâ€™s economy welcomes Schengen accessionAustrian business representatives spoke of an â€œimportant stepâ€ as the agreement makes things easier for companies. Austrian businesses are among the most important investors in Romania with 11.2 billion Euro and thus more than 61,000 local jobs, and in Bulgaria with 2.8 billion Euro and more than 21,000 local jobs, according to the Industrial Association.Â The Austrian Chamber of Commerce (WKÃ–) called for further talks and a comprehensive solution: â€œRomania and Bulgaria are important economic partners for Austriaâ€™s economy, our companies are the second most important foreign investors in both countries and have important sales markets in the region.â€This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Belgian presidency works on new financial aid for Ukraine,"Ambassadors from the 27 EU member states have been given a partial mandate to negotiate with the European Parliament on new long-term financial aid for Ukraine. Austria's Karoline Edtstadler reacts to the announcement of European Council President Charles Michel's resignation. Statistics from the EU delegation in Tirana show that the EU is financially supporting Albania with pre-accession funds.Belgian presidency may pave way for EU funding for UkraineBrussels (Belga) – The permanent representatives of the 27 EU member states have given a partial negotiating mandate to the Belgian presidency of the EU Council to start talks with the European Parliament on new long-term financial support for Ukraine.It is not a full mandate, as the EU heads of state and government could not reach an agreement at the December summit. Such an agreement was blocked by Hungary, which linked its mandate to the release of all suspended EU funds for the country.In this case, a partial negotiating mandate means that the general framework of the legal instrument has been approved by member states, but decisions on figures and certain modalities are left to the heads of state and government. On 1 February, European heads of state and government will make another attempt to reach an agreement with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ n on new financial support for Ukraine.The ambassadors of the 27 EU member states also discussed the file on a new Strategic Technologies Platform (STEP). This is designed to channel investment into strategic sectors. Both instruments are part of the mid-term review of the European Union's multi-annual budget (2021-2027).With these two partial mandates, the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU can begin discussions with the other co-legislator, the European Parliament. The idea is to lay the ground, so that an agreement between the Council and Parliament can be worked towards as soon as possible, once the heads of state and government have reached a full agreement. (10 January)Austrian Minister for the EU and Constitution Karoline Edtstadler. The upcoming EU top job decisions are ""a particular balancing act"", Edtstadler told APA. Photo: APA/Roland SchlagerMichelâ€™s withdrawal: Edtstadler insists on ""stability""Vienna/Brussels (APA) – Austria's Minister for European Affairs Karoline Edtstadler is insisting on ""stability and the ability to act"" in the European Council in view of the announced withdrawal of European Council President Charles Michel. The upcoming EU top job decisions were ""a particular balancing act,"" Edtstadler told APA. However, she emphasised that the EU institutions were ""strong enough in any case to resolve the upcoming personnel issues, regardless of who is ultimately in charge.""The minister expressed no pleasure at Michel's decision to prematurely end his second and final term of office, which runs until November, in favour of standing as the Belgian Liberals' lead candidate in the European elections at the beginning of June.""The main task of the President of the European Council is to mediate between the member states. Agreeing on a personnel package is a particular balancing act,"" said Edtstadler. ""It is therefore important that the necessary stability and ability to act of the European Council is guaranteed in this phase. Whether a candidacy for the European Parliament is right in view of this responsibility is something Charles Michel must judge for himself,"" she added.Michel's announcement caused quite a stir in Brussels over the weekend. Experts and EU diplomats reacted with incomprehension. It was pointed out that the abrupt withdrawal could lead to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n taking over the important leadership role. Hungary holds the presidency of the EU Council in the second half of the year, but this only relates to the meetings of specialised ministers. Michel countered the criticism by stating that a succession decision could be made in good time if the political will was there. (9 January)Sign with the inscription ""Europe is here"" in Tirana.

At least 11,500 participants took part in exchanges between the EU and Albania in the field of education, training and youth sports under ERASMUS from 2014 to 2020.

MEPs threaten legal action over EU billions for Hungary,"MEPs have called for further steps to prepare a court case against the European Commission over the unblocking of billions of EU funds for Hungary. In December, the Commission released funds to win Hungaryâ€™s support for Ukraine. The European Council is due to discuss the financial aid to Kyiv again at an extraordinary summit in February.In a resolution passed on Thursday, EU lawmakers called on the European Council to take the next step against Hungary under Article 7.2 of the EU treaty, which could ultimately lead to the country being stripped of its voting rights. It also instructs the Legal Affairs Committee and the Parliamentâ€™s Legal Service to investigate the release of the funds and determine if legal action against the European Commission is required. If there are indications of breaches of EU law, the case will be referred to the European Court of Justice.In December, the European Commission released around 10 billion Euro in frozen EU funds to Hungary despite ongoing allegations of abuse of power and corruption in the country. The European Commission unlocked the money for Budapest last month as Brussels looked to win Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s backing for more support for Ukraine. Hungary still vetoed the agreement at the EU leadersâ€™ last summit in December.Â Hungary was the only nation that opposed the consensus found by the other 26 partners to review the multiannual financial framework (MFP) for 2021–2027. Besides aid to Ukraine, it also includes a reinforcement of immigration and neighbourhood policy, strategic investments and support in the face of natural disasters.The failure to commit more aid to prop up Ukraineâ€™s budget over the next four years dealt a blow to the country, even after the EU took the symbolic step of agreeing to open membership talks.Hungary risks losing voting rightsParliament argued that the Commission was wrong to allow 10 billion Euro in funds from the European budget to be disbursed to Hungary, while acknowledging that the judicial reform promoted by Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government represented sufficient progress in improving the independence of justice in this country. In a parliamentary debate about the December summit on Wednesday, MEPs from several political groups sharply criticised the December release.Last May, Hungary approved a new law on justice reform. â€œThis is what we asked for, and Hungary delivered,â€œ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament earlier this week.However, the Parliament is concerned that this money could reach Hungary without adequate control measures in place to ensure sound financial management and protection of the European budget. It also considers that the recent judicial reform is not sufficient to dispel its doubts.Von der Leyen, however, reassured MEPs on Wednesday that Brussels will not release more funds to Hungary while Budapest does not resolve its deficiencies regarding the rights of the LGTBIQ+ community, academic freedom and right to asylum – the issues that are currently causing the other 20 billion Euro to remain frozen.A group of EU lawmakers from across the political spectrum believes that if the Commission releases more funds to Hungary without the conditions being met, the European Parliament would reserve the right to take further political and legal action. In the face of mounting pressure over Hungaryâ€™s alleged violations of the rule of law, the country also risks being stripped of its voting rights. The resolution passed in Parliament called on the European Council to explore this possibility under the on-going Article 7 procedure on the rule of law.â€œAt the moment, we, the European Parliament, are not asking for stripping Hungary of its voting rights, but we are asking the Council to initiate such examination,â€œ said Romanian MEP Siegfried MureÈ™an.The office of the Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob sees the escalation as a bad scenario for both the EU and Hungary. â€œWe do not want to see any country being stripped of its rights, but at the same time the EU as a whole cannot be held hostage by one member state, Hungary or any other,â€œ the office wrote in response to questions from the Slovenian Press Agency (STA).Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib, whose country currently holds the presidency of the EU Council, said that for her the rule of law is at â€œthe centre of its political actionâ€œ and announced that her country will organise a new hearing about Hungary within the framework of the rule of law file.Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico (left) and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n during a joint press conference in Budapest on Tuesday, 16 January 2024. Photo: TASR - Ladislav Vallach *** Local Caption ***Budapest not isolated after all?After meeting his ally Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico on Tuesday, OrbÃ¡n said Budapest would be willing to contribute its fair share to a new aid package, provided it happens outside the blocâ€™s budget.â€œHungary is ready to support Ukraine, it will do so from its own budget, it does not want to take out loans jointly with anyone, and it does not want this issue to be included in the [EUâ€™s] budget,â€œ the Hungarian prime minister said.  â€œIf we want to help Ukraine... we must do so without damaging the EU budget,â€œ he added.Both leaders have been critical of sending aid to Ukraine, although Fico supported the package OrbÃ¡n blocked in December. Speaking alongside OrbÃ¡n, Fico said Hungaryâ€™s proposal is â€œrational and meaningfulâ€œ.According to media reports, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is trying to convince OrbÃ¡n to lift his veto in return for the membership of his political party Fidesz in the European Conservatives and Reformists group (ECR).Â Â Â OrbÃ¡n maintains ties with KremlinOrbÃ¡n is the only EU leader who has maintained close ties with the Kremlin following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine. However, at the EU leadersâ€™ summit in Brussels last month, he did not  stand in the way of a decision to start negotiations with Ukraine on joining the EU. Russia praised Hungary for blocking the aid, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying Hungary â€œin contrast to many European countries, firmly defends its interests, which impresses usâ€œ. Moscow was far more critical of the decision by the EU to open accession talks with Ukraine and fellow former soviet state Moldova, and make Georgia a formal candidate to join.Â Â In October, Hungary also threatened to veto Bulgariaâ€™s Schengen accession if the country did not abolish the transit fee for Russian gas. In December last year, however, Bulgaria eventually scrapped this fee. Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov highlighted the location from which Hungarian Foreign and Trade Minister PÃ©ter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ raised the issue – Beijing, where a Hungarian government delegation was participating in the third edition of the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation and where OrbÃ¡n held a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. â€œOne might wonder if there are other interests involved,â€œ Denkov noted.To be continuedFollowing the European Parliamentâ€™s vote on the resolution on Thursday, the matter will now go to the European Parliamentâ€™s Legal Affairs Committee, which will have to prepare the case with the institutionâ€™s legal services and decide whether to file a lawsuit.Meanwhile, EU leaders will reconvene on February 1 for another summit aimed at overcoming OrbÃ¡nâ€™s veto on the funding for Ukraine. The president of the European Council, Charles Michel, decided to postpone the decision in order to convince Hungary to join the agreement or find a solution that would allow it to move forward without its support.Â Budapest has signalled it could agree to the aid if it is given the chance each year to veto further payments. EU officials say that if they cannot win over Hungary, the other 26 member states will look to provide cash outside the EUâ€™s budget, but this is likely to be for a shorter timeframe.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Macron calls on Europe to invest in its future,"France is proposing that Europe should issue common debt again.  In other news, Slovenia is reluctant on the question of whether the EU should deprive Hungary of its voting rights under Article 7 of the EU Treaty. Romanian MEP Daniel Buda calls for more subsidies to support farmers across Europe. Macron calls on Europe to issue new common debt again to invest in â€œpriorities for the futureâ€Davos (AFP) – In Davos on Wednesday, French President Emmanuel Macron called on Europeans to reissue common debt, as they did during the Covid-19 pandemic, to invest in â€œmajor priorities for the future.â€ He called for â€œenhanced cooperationâ€ to deepen the union of capital markets.The French President told the World Economic Forum that ""we need more public investment in Europe (...) on major priorities for the future"" and ""perhaps by daring once again to issue 'Eurobonds'.â€ He said that 2024, the year of the European elections, would be ""key"" for Europe.""Alongside this, we also need to deepen the union of capital markets. We absolutely must have a much more integrated financial Europe,â€ Macron argued.""If the 27 of us get bogged down, France will propose moving forward on enhanced cooperation on this issue, because we absolutely must move forward,â€ he announced.In his view, ""our continent has a lot of savings. But these savings are poorly allocated. They (...) don't go to the right sectors.â€ (January 17)Slovenia reluctant to strip Hungary of its voting rightsLjubljana (STA) – Regarding the current calls for action by the European Parliament against Hungaryâ€™s rule of law deficiencies, Slovenia does not want to deprive any country of its rights. Still, at the same time, the EU could not be held hostage by one member, the office of Sloveniaâ€™s Prime Minister Robert Golob declared.Golobâ€™s office sees the danger of an escalating situation which would be a bad scenario for both the EU and Hungary. â€œWe do not want to deprive any country of its rights, but at the same time, the entire EU cannot be held hostage by one member state, Hungary or any other. The best option is to talk and to find an agreement, but it is not the only option,â€ the office declared.The Prime Ministerâ€™s office is convinced that since a possible compromise or â€œPlan Bâ€ was mentioned at the December summit, no radical steps will be needed to find a solution to help Ukraine, which Hungary currently blocks.â€œWe are confident that a solution to help Ukraine will be achieved,â€ the office says, pointing to the agreement of all member states for the period until the end of the current financial framework as the most effective and predictable solution for a timely delivery of financial assistance to Ukraine. The leaders will try to reach an agreement again at an extraordinary summit on February 1. (January 18)EP to discuss farmersâ€™ problems at Romanian MEP Daniel Budaâ€™s requestStrasbourg (AGERPRES) – In Strasbourg on Wednesday, the European Parliament discussed the problems of farmers protesting in several European countries. The EP put the debate on the agenda at the request of the Vice-President of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), Daniel Buda, a Romanian MEP.The politician told the Romanian press in Strasbourg that farmers needed EU subsidies, otherwise they would not be able to overcome challenges such as drought, inflation, floods and the war in Ukraine. â€œI would like to believe that within a few months, the European Commission will be able to raise the necessary funds to support farmers, because by helping them we are supporting consumers, that is, all of us.â€Daniel Buda After a debate on the farmersâ€™ problems, the EP did not take a position on the issue, as there was not enough time to negotiate a common text.

Europe in brief: ECFR survey shows right turn for European Parliament,"According to a survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), far-right political parties are likely to gain ground in the June elections. Slovakiaâ€™s Peter Pellegrini said he would support the re-nomination of MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ as European commissioner. The EU delegation in Belgrade has launched a campaign to improve the digital skills of older people in Serbia.Survey predicts pull to the right in European ParliamentBrussels (Belga) – According to a comprehensive voter intention survey by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a pan-European think tank, the composition of the European Parliament will look completely different after the June elections. Across Europe, anti-European, populist right-wing parties are likely to do well, and moderate mainstream parties will probably lose popularity.The survey predicts that in nine out of 27 EU countries, populist parties with an anti-European profile will emerge victorious in the elections. These include Belgium, where Vlaams Belang is likely to narrowly overtake the Flemish nationalist party N-VA. Both will probably get three seats in the European Parliament.In France, Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National might become the largest party with 25 seats. In Italy, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia could climb to 27 seats (up from six today). The Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD), while having to leave the leading position to the conservative CDU/CSU in Germany, will still become the country's second largest party with 20 seats (it currently has 11).As a result, researchers say, the far-right ID group and the conservative ECR group in the European Parliament would grow solidly. However, the existing 'super coalition' of the European People's Party (EPP), social democrats (S&D) and liberals (Renew), which put Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in the saddle five years ago, would still account for 54 percent of seats, compared to 60 percent today.This shift in power could have major implications for European policy, the survey results said. While the Green Deal enjoyed the support of a centre-left coalition in the last legislature, the move to the right may put pressure on the climate agenda. As pro-Russian parties may also make their entry into the European Parliament, the election results could also have implications for support to Ukraine in its war with Russia. The rule of law is also at risk of becoming less important to the European Parliament. (24 January)Slovak parliamentary president supports new term for country's European CommissionerBrussels (TASR) – Slovak European Commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ will have the support of the President of the National Council of the Slovak Republic for another term. Provided the Slovak government re-nominated Å efÄoviÄ and he accepted the nomination, Peter Pellegrini voiced his support on Wednesday in Brussels, after meetings with Å efÄoviÄ, European Council President Charles Michel and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen.During a two-day visit to Brussels, Pellegrini said that a coalition council would meet later this week to discuss a number of European issues. Asked by TASR whether he would support the nomination of Å efÄoviÄ if the government decided to nominate him as European commissioner, he replied positively.""I want to raise this at the coalition council, not yet as an official matter, but internally. Å efÄoviÄ has shown an extraordinary ability to hold such important posts. Today he is de facto the second most powerful member of the European Commission,"" Pellegrini said.He stressed that von der Leyen had spoken highly of Å efÄoviÄ during her negotiations with him. She is said to rely on him to the maximum extent and give him the most difficult things to deal with, Pellegrini told reporters. ""Most importantly, however, she described Å efÄoviÄ as a person who not only solves problems but also delivers results. Å efÄoviÄ was a very good candidate for the Slovak government and I, as one of the coalition members, can personally imagine that if he decided to run for the post of commissioner again, he would certainly get my support,"" Pellegrini said.If the government of Prime Minister Robert Fico nominates Å efÄoviÄ, it will be his fourth full mandate in the European Commission. He has held the post of Commissioner for Education, Training, Culture and Youth for only three months, replacing JÃ¡n Figel. During JosÃ© Manuel Barroso's second mandate, he was responsible for administration and inter-institutional relations. In the Jean-Claude Juncker-led European Commission, as vice-president, he was in charge of building the Energy Union. He retained his vice-presidency during Ursula von der Leyen's mandate, where he was initially responsible for the strategic outlook and interinstitutional relations, but his work agenda grew over time.Å efÄoviÄ is now responsible for the implementation of the European Green Deal, leading the post-Brexit negotiations with the United Kingdom and finalising negotiations on new association agreements with Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino and Switzerland. He is vice-chair of the EU Energy Platform, which ensures the joint purchase of natural gas, and his name is also associated with the European Battery Alliance. (24 January)Launch of EU campaign to improve digital skills of the elderly in SerbiaBelgrade (Tanjug) – The Delegation of the European Union in Serbia has launched the campaign ""Everything is easy when you know how"", which aims to raise awareness on the issue of improving the digital skills of senior citizens in Serbia, to help them master the basic knowledge that will facilitate their communication, use of digital services and other digital resources.According to 2022 data from the Serbian Statistical Office, 32.4 percent of the population over the age of 65 had then used a computer in the previous 12 months, and 44.5 percent had used the internet in the previous year, compared to 69.71 percent in the EU. As noted by the EU delegation, in our age of rapid technological progress, older citizens often face numerous challenges in the process of adapting to new technologies, and therefore find it harder to fit into social trends. As a consequence of the digital divide, the older part of the population is deprived of fully utilising the benefits of digital services, but also the possibilities of communication and integration with family and friends.That is why, with the campaign under the slogan ""Everything is easy when you know how"", the EU Delegation in Serbia appeals to the public and the younger generations to help the elderly to overcome digital challenges, and at the same time invites older citizens to apply for free digital skills training in Belgrade, NiÅ¡, Novi Sad and several other cities in Serbia, which will be held from February to June 2024.""In the EU, we follow the universal principle of leaving no one behind, and therefore we strive to work on the inclusion of all parts of communities that face any challenges. Elderly citizens are often excluded from their societies, unable to keep up with developing technology, and we must make sure that they do not fall behind,"" said the head of the EU Delegation in Serbia Emanuele Giaufret. He added that ""it is our duty as a society, but also of their children, grandchildren and fellow citizens, to return the knowledge and attention with which they raised us.""The campaign ""Everything is easy when you know how"" will last until February 19. The campaign consists of two parallel activities – raising public awareness (including through TV spots and billboards) and the organisation of educational workshops intended for older citizens.

"Price crisis sees angry farmers across Europe, unhappiness with EU agricultural lawsÂ ","For weeks now, farmers across the continent have taken their anger and worry about their livelihoods to the streets. After protests in front of the European Parliament in Brussels on Wednesday, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen opened the Strategic Dialogue on Agriculture the following day.Europeâ€™s farmers are in revolt and their anger is growing: The fury has led to road blockages and tractor parades in the past few weeks, with farmers taking their protests to the street in France, Germany, Lithuania, Poland and Romania, and the Netherlands before that. While farmers have protested over national issues, concerns over increasing challenges facing agriculture including extreme weather, bird flu and surging fuel costs are uniting them. Another source of discontent is over what farmers say is excessive regulation, also on European level. Then there is the influx of Ukrainian agricultural products into the EU since the lifting of customs duties in 2022. The European Commission must soon reveal its intentions on the renewal of the customs exemption, which expires in June.The agricultural question, in light of the European Parliament elections in June and surveys showing a surge of the far-right and nationalists who take up agricultural issues fervently, is important. Farmers are a ""very important electorate"", said EU lawmaker and vice-president of the parliament's socialist grouping, Pedro Marques. On Thursday, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen – aiming at defusing the anger – launched a new strategic dialogue format that brings together farmers, environmental organisations and industry to develop solutions to the problems of agriculture in Europe. According to the German politician, everyone agrees that the challenges are increasing. Among the main issues are topics such as farmersâ€™ income, sustainability, technological innovation and competitiveness. These were also discussed at the meeting of the EUâ€™s agricultural ministers at the Agricultural and Fisheries Council (AGRIFISH) on Tuesday. Concerns that the green transition will wreak further havoc for farmers are also part of the program.The dialogue at EU level aims to develop new solutions and achieve a common vision by summer 2024 and present this to the EU Commission. The initiative, only confirmed at the end of last week, was promised by von der Leyen last September, calling for â€œless polarisationâ€ and assuring that â€œagriculture and nature protection can go hand in handâ€. Powerful agri-group Copa-Cogeca said it was a â€œwelcome initiative, albeit one which has been slow to materialiseâ€, adding that â€œthe scope of the discussions remains particularly vagueâ€.Protests across EuropeA day prior, on January 24, demonstrations were held in front of the European Parliament in Brussels. â€œThe demonstrations will grow because discontent is growing and this will affect the European elections,â€ French farmer StÃ©phane BleuzÃ© said during the protests. â€œWe came to Brussels because this is where the rules that affect us are decided.â€ Marion MarÃ©chal, who will lead the French right-wing ReconquÃªte (Reconquest) movement in the European elections and is the niece of Marine Le Pen, attended the Brussels protest criticizing EU agriculture policies.The Flemish trade union Algemeen Boerensyndicaat (ABS) said that â€œtoday's action is yet another cry for helpâ€ and that  â€œfarmers don't ask for much, just to fulfil their social role and to be treated fairlyâ€.In Germany, for example, angry farmers have for weeks been protesting over diesel fuel subsidy cuts, including with mass demonstrations in several cities in which farmers blocked traffic with tractors and other pieces of farm equipment. The government agreed to soften the measure by phasing out the diesel fuel subsidy over three years, instead of immediately, but has otherwise stuck by the policy. Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s coalition has been under pressure to raise tax revenue or cut spending to close a major budget gap. The nationwide farmersâ€™ protests sparked a discussion about the extent to which farmers are being exploited for the interests of far-right parties.In neighbouring Austria where citizens will vote in national elections in autumn, the right-wing FPÃ– organised a farmersâ€™ demonstration last week. The farmersâ€™ association of the conservative Ã–VP, in response, criticised that the party was â€œinstrumentalising the farmers for its own party purposesâ€ and distanced itself from the â€œelection campaign games at the expense of the farmersâ€.In France, the growing anger of French farmers is shaping up to be the first major challenge of President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s newly appointed government. The new Prime Minister Gabriel Attal paid tribute to the countryâ€™s agriculture sector last weekend, responding to the growing discontent of farm workers. A reform package designed to meet some grievances has been postponed for fine-tuning. MEP Jordan Bardella who will lead the far-right National Rally into the June elections claimed there is growing anger against â€œthe European Union and the Europe of Macronâ€, who according to Bardella wanted â€œthe death of our agricultureâ€. Some political observers think it could pose a major challenge to Franceâ€™s mainstream parties. In recent months, â€œexasperationâ€ has also spread to Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria, where producers essentially denounce â€œunfair competitionâ€ from Ukraine, accused of undercutting the price of their cereals. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the export of Ukrainian agricultural products through so-called Solidarity Lanes created disruptions in the internal markets of those countries.Â In Poland, protests led to the resignation of the Minister of Agriculture in April 2023. In November, Polish operators began to block the crossing points with Ukraine, along with truckers. Farmers suspended their blockade on January 6 after an agreement with the Polish government.In Romania, farmersâ€™ and transportersâ€™ protests began on January 7. Hundreds of tractors and trucks blocked border traffic, making it difficult for grain trucks from Ukraine to enter the country. The farmers demand compensation for the losses caused by the major disruption of the grain market following the import of cheap grain from Ukraine, which, they claim, does not comply with EU standards. On January 21, Bulgarian Minister of Agriculture and Food, Kiril Vatev, and Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov met the National Grain Producers Association and the Bulgarian Agrarian Chamber to discuss the status quo and avoid potential future protests. Farmers rallied in Sofia in November last year. The protests could have a contagious effect: â€œThe Italian and Spanish (agricultural unions) are also talking about demonstrations,â€ says the president of the Committee of Professional Agricultural Organisations of the European Union (Copa), Christiane Lambert. The Slovenian Farmerâ€™s Trade Union urged the new Minister of Agriculture, Mateja ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡, to resolve their demands, which they addressed to the government during protests last spring. â€œSome solutions have to be offered, because if they are not, farmers are calling on us to follow in the footsteps of German protests,â€ according to the union.In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, several thousand farmers with 1,300 tractors gathered this week for two days to demand better prices, lower taxes on fuel, simplification of regulations and a ban on the transit of Russian grain through their country.A farmer carries a canister of plant protection agent with glyphosate at his farm. The European Union has authorized the use of the controversial weedkiller glyphosate for 10 more years in 2023. Photo: Friso Gentsch/dpaCourting an important electorate Less than five months out from the European Elections and many national elections, the protesting farmers and agricultural producers fuel the campaign fires. Political parties are already courting the farmersâ€™ vote. Agriculture makes up eleven percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. As part of the so-called Green Deal, the EU Commission under von der Leyenâ€™s leadership launched several projects. In the summer, for example, there was great displeasure over a nature conservation law that also affects the use of agricultural land. Also bans on pesticides cleared for use in other parts of the world are a source of farmersâ€™ discontent.Their discontent has been a growing concern in the European Parliament. The centre-right EPP, the largest parliamentary grouping of which von der Leyen is a member, has often sought to water down agricultural texts, arguing it represents farmersâ€™ wishes. â€œWe share the green ambition but it must be adapted to the economic situation. Agricultural prices are falling, expenses are skyrocketing, by adding additional regulatory efforts, itâ€™s too much,â€ EPP MEP Anne Sander said.â€œThereâ€™s a perception that the centre-right and the far-right are trying to create in the farmers that the green transition, those that choose the green transition, are going against them,â€ EU lawmaker Marques said. But he recognised the need to provide support, especially as the EU prepares to debate its ambitious 2040 climate targets, which will involve a costly decarbonisation of the agricultural industry.This article is published weekly.

EU split over aid cuts for UNRWA,"The EU is one of UNRWAâ€™s top donors. Following Israeli allegations that some staff participated in Hamasâ€™s October 7 attack, the EU announced to review its support. While some believe this to be an urgent measure, others warn of collective punishment of the Palestinian people.Â On Monday, the EU announced it is reviewing its funding of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and payments would be stopped until the end of February. The EU demanded an â€œurgent auditâ€ following the allegations by the Israeli authorities that some UNRWA staff participated in Hamasâ€™s October 7 attack.â€œWhat is absolutely clear is that these actions are urgent. They are important and they should be launched without any delay.â€European Commission Chief Spokesperson Eric Mamer The audit must be led by Commission-appointed experts and conducted alongside a UN investigation into the claims, it said. The commission statement also stated that humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank â€œwill continue unabated through partner organisationsâ€.UNRWA warns of humanitarian disasterThe Wall Street Journal reported, quoting an Israeli dossier, that ten percent of Palestinian UNRWA employees â€œhave close linksâ€ to terror organisations operating in Gaza. The New York Times reported previously, referring to the dossier, that one UNRWA employee had been involved in the kidnapping of a woman from Israel, another had distributed ammunition and a third had been involved in a massacre in a kibbutz in which 97 people died. The dossier contains allegations against a total of twelve UNRWA employees. Washington categorises them as credible. As a reaction, UNRWA has fired several staff members over Israelâ€™s accusations, which have prompted numerous countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Germany and Japan, to announce they were suspending further funding to the UN agency. Decisions that the UN agencyâ€™s Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini described as â€œshockingâ€, stressing that more than two million people in Gaza â€œdepend on UNRWA for their mere survivalâ€. He urged the countries to â€œreconsider their decisionsâ€. UNRWA said it would have to end operations within a month if funding was not restored.The UN Emergency Relief Coordinator Martin Griffiths has described UNRWA as the â€œcentrepieceâ€ of humanitarian care for the people of the Gaza Strip. The life-saving work of UNRWA in the course of the war â€œshould not be jeopardised by accusations of the alleged actions of a few individualsâ€, said Griffiths at a meeting of the UN Security Council in New York on Wednesday. Griffiths was appalled by the allegations and said that all efforts would therefore be made to guarantee the worldâ€™s demands for a politically neutral organisation.Guterres calls on countries to continue supportUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has promised an urgent independent review of UNRWA but also pleaded for donor states to â€œguarantee the continuityâ€ of the agency for the sake of â€œthe desperate populationsâ€ it serves.Slovenia has joined Guterresâ€™s call for countries to continue the funding of UNRWA, the Foreign Ministry said in a statement to the news agency STA on Tuesday. Freezing funds would jeopardise UNRWA and put the lives of Palestinians in the Middle East at risk. Slovenia thus allocated 1.2 million euros for the agency last year, the most so far. A decision of the countryâ€™s contribution for this year has not yet been made. Borrell: â€˜There is no alternative to UNRWAâ€™On February 1, at the sidelines of the European summit, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, warned that hundreds of thousands of people would perish if funding would stop. â€œIf you cut the funding to UNRWA, you are punishing the whole Palestinian people. There is no alternative to UNRWA (...)  if you want to keep these people alive. So, no collective punishment to the Palestinian people,â€ he stressed. https://twitter.com/JosepBorrellF/status/1752753412075123177Spain will not withdraw its supportSpain, which has always been firm with the proposal to recognise a Palestinian State, will maintain its support, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, assured on Monday. It will, however, closely follow the investigations. Albares emphasised that only a dozen of the agencyâ€™s approximately 30,000 employees are being investigated, of which 13,000 work in Gaza and carry out â€œessentialâ€ work in support of the population of the strip.This prompted the Israeli Minister of the Diaspora, Amichai Chikli, to affirm that UNRWA â€œis Hamasâ€ and that Israel is â€œextremely disappointedâ€ that Spain has not withdrawn its funding from the agency. Belgium continues support given the â€˜high humanitarian needsâ€™On Wednesday after the United Nations briefed donors on their investigation, Belgium announced to continue their funding for the time being, â€œgiven the high humanitarian needs and the threat of famine in Gazaâ€, Development Cooperation Minister Caroline Gennez (of the social-democratic party Vooruit) stated. UN briefings indicate that Israeli security forces have not yet shared evidence with them or the other donors.Belgium will await results from an investigation into possible links between members of UNRWA staff and the Palestinian extremist organisation Hamas. â€œIf the allegations are confirmed, very strict action must be taken. It is absolutely unacceptable for staff to be involved in, or glorify, the barbaric terrorist attacks of October 7,â€ Gennez said.Austria, Croatia, Germany, Romania and Sweden to suspend paymentsThe Romanian Foreign Ministry announced on Monday that it has suspended its voluntary payments to UNRWA. â€œ'Until the investigation is concluded, the ministry will not make any new voluntary contributions to UNRWA',â€ the ministry said.  Croatia did not plan any donations to UNRWA in 2024. In the past, it made donations â€œonly exceptionally, upon appealâ€, the Foreign Ministry told the Croatian News Agency Hina. Since the beginning of the war, Croatia donated a total of 1.25 million euros in emergency humanitarian aid for the civilian population of Gaza. UNRWA obtained 250,000 euros in emergency humanitarian assistance for the civilian population of Gaza, according to the ministry.Sweden, traditionally a strong ally of UNRWA, has decided to pause the funding while the Swedish development agency, SIDA, is investigating the situation. â€œI share the view that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is horrible. Sweden wants to help the civilian population, but we need to make sure that the support is not being used for the wrong things,â€ said the conservative Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson in a press conference. The Swedish Social democrats criticised the decision to withdraw aid. â€œThis could ruin the most important aid organisation for the Palestinians in a situation where millions of civilians are affected by war and at risk of starvation,â€ wrote Morgan Johansson, former minister of justice, on X.On Monday, the Austrian Foreign Office stated that â€œthe allegations (...) are deeply shocking and extremely disturbingâ€. All contributions to UNRWA have been suspended â€œuntil all these allegations have been fully clarifiedâ€. The Austrian contribution to UNRWA is divided into an annual contribution of around 400,000 euros and project-related contributions of three million Euros per year for a health project. However, as the Foreign Ministry noted, Austria is continuing to help the suffering civilian population in the Gaza Strip through other channels. Since October 7, a total of 13 million euros in humanitarian aid has been provided for this purpose. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, who suspended the aid for the moment,  demanded quick investigations. â€œThe situation in Gaza is simply hell,â€ said the Green politician on Wednesday in Berlin. UNRWA is almost the sole provider of supplies in Gaza, as all other aid organisations there â€œcan hardly be active at the momentâ€, she said. Last year, Germany funded UNRWA with a total of 206.5 million euros. According to the German Foreign Office, Germany will not authorise new payments for the time of the investigation. In any case, no new commitments are currently pending.EPP calls for debate on UNRWA at EP plenary in Strasbourg The European Peopleâ€™s Party is requesting a debate on UNRWAâ€™s alleged participation in the Hamas attacks at next weekâ€™s EP plenary in Strasbourg, the Swedish MEP David Lega, member of the Committees on Foreign Affairs and Human Rights, announced on X. â€œThere can be no business as usual – we must once and for all stop funding terrorism,â€ he wrote.Possible deal?Protesters block road during a protest calling for immediate release of all the Israeli hostages in Gaza. Foto: Ilia Yefimovich/dpaThe Times of Israel reported that the Israeli secret service Mossad informed the ministers of the war cabinet on Monday of the outlines of a possible agreement. These envisage the release of 35 female, sick, injured and elderly hostages in a first phase in which the fighting would pause for 35 days. This would be followed by a further one-week ceasefire, during which the negotiators would also attempt to release young men and hostages, who Hamas considers to be soldiers.A central point that is not yet resolved, is Hamaâ€™' demand that the agreement provide for a permanent ceasefire, which Israel has ruled out. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly emphasised that Israel will stick to its goals of destroying Hamas and ensuring that Gaza no longer poses a threat to Israel. An agreement for the release of the hostages could be resolved soon but Israel stressed again â€œnot at any priceâ€, Netanyahu said on Wednesday evening.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: EU leaders agree on 50-billion-euro package for Ukraine,"At a special European Council summit in Brussels, EU leaders agreed on a new aid package to help Ukraine in its war with Russia. Germany's Christian Lindner wants the EU's new anti-money-laundering authority to be based in Frankfurt. The European Commission has asked France to explain the blocking of lorries carrying Spanish products in the wake of farmers' protests.OrbÃ¡n agrees to new support package for UkraineBrussels (Belga) – ""All 27 leaders agreed on an additional 50-billion-euro support package for Ukraine within the EU budget,"" European Council President Charles Michel reported on X. He said the agreement provided ""steadfast, long-term, predictable"" funding for Kiev in the longer term. The ""EU is taking leadership & responsibility in support of Ukraine; we know what is at stake.""Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, who had stubbornly opposed the package at the December summit, is now also on board. A number of leaders, including Michel, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron, are said to have convinced him to abandon his opposition in a separate get-together before the start of the summit.OrbÃ¡n was pushing for an annual veto on funding, but he failed to secure it. The heads of state and government will, however, hold an annual debate on the implementation of the aid package, based on a European Commission report. ""If necessary"" the leaders could also ask the Commission to propose a revision within two years, diplomatic sources said.The new aid package, comprising 17 billion euros in grants and 33 billion euros in loans, runs until 2027. It should provide Ukraine with much-needed funds to keep the state apparatus running during the exhausting war with Russia, especially now that there is uncertainty over US aid due to the split in parliament in Washington.The Ukraine aid package is part of a broader review of Europe's multi-year budget. It is now up to the Belgian EU presidency to clinch the deal with the European Parliament, which must also give its approval. Negotiations will start on Monday on the sidelines of the Parliamentâ€™s plenary session in Strasbourg. (1 February)EU anti-money-laundering authority: Lindner promotes Frankfurt in BrusselsBrussels (dpa) – German Finance Minister Christian Lindner has campaigned in Brussels to promote Frankfurt as the headquarters of the planned EU anti-money-laundering authority (AMLA). At a public hearing in the European Parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, the politician said that Frankfurt had everything AMLA needed to be operational from day one and to exercise its tasks and powers in full. The Federal Republic of Germany, the state of Hesse and the city of Frankfurt intend to provide at least ten million euros for the establishment of the agency.Lindner went on to say that as an important financial centre, Frankfurt had a large pool of financial and academic talent and attracted people from all over the EU and beyond. ""The close proximity to the European Central Bank (ECB) enables us to create a central point of contact for European supervision."" This was crucial to effectively combat money laundering, said Lindner. He then answered questions from MEPs and representatives of the EU countries.The European Commission had proposed a joint money laundering authority in 2021, to coordinate and support the national supervisory agencies. In addition to Frankfurt, Rome, Vienna, Vilnius, Riga, Dublin, Madrid, Brussels and Paris are also vying to host the new authority. The decisive vote by the representatives of the European Parliament and the EU countries is scheduled for 22 February.For the first time, public hearings are part of the process for selecting the seat of a new EU agency. The European Court of Justice has granted the European Parliament the same right as the member states to have a say in determining the seat of future agencies. (31 January)Brussels asks France for explanations over attacks on Spanish lorriesBrussels (Europa Press) – The European Commission has asked France to explain the protests by French farmers, which have included blocking the passage of lorries carrying Spanish products, EU sources told Europa Press.In principle, the Commission saw no evidence of the unfair competition claimed by French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal, the sources added.Last Sunday, Attal said that the French government was studying measures to tackle ""unfair competition,"" something that has been interpreted as a veiled reference to Spain and Italy.Two days earlier, the Commission had sent a letter to the French authorities asking for explanations about the border disturbances and reminding them that EU member states must take measures to ensure the free movement of goods when an obstacle appears.For his part, the Spanish Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Luis Planas, has responded to Attal by saying that ""there is no competitive advantage derived from the application of different rules,"" because all member countries apply the same production and marketing rules.

EU foreign ministers: relations with African partners a geopolitical priority,"Following geopolitical developments such as Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine, the EUâ€™s interests towards the African continent began to shift. The blocâ€™s foreign ministers sought to rethink their approach and interests towards their African partners.At an informal meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell pledged to support, on behalf of the EU, African countriesâ€™ demands for more weight and representation in multilateral discussions. â€œOn Africa (...) we have been discussing the continent as a geopolitical priority, our absolute determination to increase our dialogue and cooperation,â€ the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Borrell said. â€œWe will support Africaâ€™s quest for a greater representation in multilateral fora,â€ he added.Africa has become a renewed diplomatic battleground since Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine began, with multiple countries on the continent aggressively courted by Russia and China as well as the West. Russiaâ€™s Wagner mercenary group maintains a strong military presence in Africa, where it has partnered with several nations, including Mali and the Central African Republic.The last French troops withdrew from Niger in December, in the latest blow to more than a decade of French anti-jihadist operations in west Africaâ€™s Sahel region. It was the third time in less than 18 months that French troops were sent packing from a Sahel nation, following military takeovers in former colonies Mali and Burkina Faso. All three nations are battling a jihadist insurgency that erupted in northern Mali in 2012.According to Borrell, â€œwe have to rethink our approach to Africa to offer more cooperation, and to understand that the stability of the African states is part of our securityâ€. He added that this was not just about the Sahel region, which is spanning across the continent as the transition zone between the Sahara desert and more humid Southern countries. Borrell said this was also about other parts of Africa, such as Sudan, the Horn of Africa as a large geopolitical region in East Africa and Somalia.Spain: The EUâ€™s land link to AfricaSpain is the only EU country that has a land border with Africa through Ceuta and Melilla, two Spanish cities located in Northern Africa and surrounded by Moroccan territory. For Spain, relations with Morocco are essential for the stability of these two enclaves and also to guarantee the control of migratory routes from sub-Saharan Africa to the Iberian Peninsula and the rest of the EU countries.In particular, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, pointed to the Sahel region as â€œa priority area for Spainâ€ and asked to maintain â€œthe EUâ€™s important presenceâ€ in that area.â€œI will ask that we continue to maintain our support for ECOWAS, an indispensable regional organisation, that we maintain our humanitarian aid and our support for the democratic processes of countries as important as Mauritania and Senegal, which are strategic partners for Europe and for Spain,â€ Albares said. ECOWAS refers to the Economic Community of West African States.Maintaining economic tiesGerman Development Minister Svenja Schulze is visiting western African leaders this week. Her trip comes around a week after the juntas that rule Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger withdrew their countries from ECOWAS. A military coup took place in Niger on July 26 last year, whereupon ECOWAS imposed sanctions and threatened military action.The Economic Community of West African States consists of 15 member states, making it one of the largest regional economic communities in Africa. All three West African states have had their memberships suspended by ECOWAS.Ahead of her departure, Schulze said that â€œfree trade and visa-free travel have made life and business in West Africa much easierâ€. She said she regrets the decision of the three states, but added that â€œthe decision by sovereign states must be respected, even if it will entail many economic disadvantagesâ€. Economic integration is a key driver of development, she added, saying the international donor community is ready to continue supporting West Africa on this path.Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger have increasingly turned to Russia amid tensions with ECOWAS.Giorgia Meloni (l), Prime Minister of Italy, welcomes Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission (r), ahead of an Italian-African summit. Prime Minister Meloni opened a summit of African heads of state and government to present Italy's development plan for the continent. Photo: Roberto Monaldo/LaPresse/AP/dpaTargeting Russian influence, energy and migrationâ€œWe have to start asking ourselves how much we can approach cooperation with some African countries more pragmatically, because the reality is that military coups have taken place in several African countries in the last two years, Russia is gaining strength in these countries and Europe is clearing its positions,â€ Czech Foreign Minister Jan LipavskÃ½ said at the informal meeting of EU foreign ministers.Italy holds the presidency of the G7 group of nations this year and has vowed to make African development a central theme, in part to increase influence in a continent where powers such as China, Russia, India, Japan and Turkey have been expanding their political clout.At a summit of African leaders in Italy at the end of January, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called for a â€œnew pageâ€ in relations with the continent, focused on energy and stopping migration across the Mediterranean. The summit came just months after Russia held its own summit with African leaders, and other countries, including China and France, have held similar initiatives.Representatives of over 25 countries attended the summit at the Italian senate – dubbed â€œA Bridge for Common Growthâ€ –  along with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and representatives of United Nations agencies and the World Bank.Meloni wants to transform Italy into an energy gateway, capitalising on demand from fellow European countries seeking to slash their dependence on Russian gas following Moscowâ€™s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.The so-called Mattei Plan hopes to position Italy as a key bridge between Africa and Europe, funnelling energy North while exchanging investment in the South for deals aimed at curbing migration. The plan intends to tackle so-called push factors and persuade origin countries to sign readmittance deals for migrants refused permission to stay in Italy.Further calls for more engagement with AfricaSlovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon called for close cooperation with Africa, which showed great confidence in Slovenia when it voted for its non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council. â€œThis is a continent that is facing challenges ranging from poverty to climate change and rising tensions, including violence. So we need to work with the African continent, it is our strategic partner,â€ the minister said ahead of the Brussels meeting. Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mariya Gabriel said that Africa is a strategic partner for Bulgaria. â€œWe must have a dialogue with the countries on the continent. I support the idea of giving greater visibility to European projects there,â€ she said. Gabriel noted that extra efforts are needed in this regard. Earlier in January, Gabriel met with her Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry. They discussed cooperation in innovation, renewable energy, hydrogen, food security, transport, and tourism. â€œEgypt is the first Arab country with which Bulgaria established diplomatic relations and the largest economic and trade partner of our country in the Middle East and Africa region. In 2026, we will mark an important anniversary: 100 years since the establishment of our diplomatic relations,â€ Gabriel wrote on Facebook. Romania recently adopted the first National Strategy for Africa aimed at relaunching ties with the African continent. This comes as part of the joint effort at the European level, in the broader context of the need to revive relations between the EU and Africa in the spirit of a new partnership. In 2024, Romania wants to intensify collaboration and continue the programs intended for African partners, with an emphasis on education and the transfer of expertise.This article is published weekly.

"Europe in brief: “Putin is going all out,” says Borrell
","EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said there was a need to explain why the EU is helping Ukraine and what a potential Russian victory would mean for Europe. The European Commission has launched an infringement procedure against Hungary over its controversial sovereignty law. Slovenia's agriculture minister is calling for individual pesticide rules for EU member states, rather than universal ones.Kiev (EFE) – The European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, said that Russia was ""going all out"" and that it was necessary to explain, with a view to the European elections in June, what it would mean to have a ""puppet governmentâ€ in Ukraine – like in Belarus – and the Russian army ""on the border"" of the European Union.""Russia is going all out. Russian President Vladimir Putin has no intention of backing down. His political survival is at stake,"" said the head of European diplomacy in an interview with EFE during his fourth visit to Ukraine since the large-scale Russian invasion, the second anniversary of which falls on 24 February.Borrell, who brought a ""strong"" message of solidarity as well as military, political and financial support from the EU to Kiev, said he was sure that Putin ""will go all out and will not mind sacrificing his army and his people, because he is suffering enormous material and human losses and has not made any significant territorial advances.â€With the European elections just around the corner (6-9 June), the EU foreign policy chief believes it is an educational task to explain the reasons why the EU is helping Ukraine and what the consequences of its defeat would be, because, he said, a possible defeat of Ukraine would mean ""having the Russian army on the border of Europe."" (7 February)Viktor OrbÃ¡n, Prime Minister of Hungary, during an international press conference. Photo: Denes Erdos/AP/dpaSovereignty law in Hungary: the EU opens infringement proceedingsBrussels (AFP) – The European Commission has launched infringement proceedings against Hungary, following the adoption in mid-December of legislation setting up a supervisory authority designed to prevent ""foreign interference"" in electoral process and ""protect the sovereignty"" of the country.This legislative package, which includes prison sentences, has been denounced by NGOs and critics of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n. They see it as a new offensive aimed at muzzling checks and balances.In a statement, the Commission said it had sent Budapest a letter of formal notice for breaching EU law. The Hungarian government now has two months to respond.While the Commission released some 10 billion euros for Hungary in mid-December, 21 billion euros of EU funds earmarked for the country remain frozen by the EU under various procedures for alleged breaches of the rule of law. (7 February)Fertilising a field in Slovenia. Photo: Tamino PetelinÅ¡ek/STASlovenian Agriculture Minister: pesticide rules cannot apply equally to allLjubljana/Brussels (STA) – Slovenia will advocate at EU level for individual treatment with regard to pesticide use, said Slovenian Agriculture Minister Mateja ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡, following the announcement by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that she would withdraw the proposed regulation on pesticides. ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡ stressed that before a regulation was adopted, it was important to know what alternatives were available to protect crops.""Slovenia has been advocating at least some relaxation of the regulation, but at the same time we have always pointed out that farmers and farmers' organisations are also in favour of reducing the use of plant protection products, but in a way that is adapted to the member states,"" said ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡.Slovenia, she explained, had many specificities, with fragmented agricultural land, which meant that the rules of the regulation could not be applied equally to all. ""That's why we are going to propose a country-by-country inventory of the problems we face. But we will make absolutely sure that before any regulation is re-adopted, we know what alternatives farmers can use to protect their crops,"" the minister said.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament plenary that the proposal for a regulation on the sustainable use of plant protection products had been withdrawn because it had become a symbol of polarisation.

"What’s at stake at the EU’s 2040 climate target
","With the bloc reeling from a farmersâ€™ revolt against green reforms, and four months before the EU elections, the EU unveiled this week its climate targets for 2040 and a roadmap for the next stage of its energy transition.The 27-nation European Union has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2050, and set a first interim target for 2030: to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent compared with 1990 levels. For the next milestone after that – 2040 – the European Commission will aim for a net drop of 90 percent. This announcement came as  widespread farmersâ€™ protests clouded the blocâ€™s transition to a greener future. The farmers protested outside the European Parliament building, angry over shrinking incomes, rising costs and what they say are increasingly onerous green regulations.The EU Climate Commissioner, Wopke Hoekstra, said the bloc would strive for a â€œfair transitionâ€, allowing businesses to thrive and ensuring â€œnobody is left behindâ€.In a sign of how politically fraught the environmental issue has become, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen gave key ground earlier on Tuesday by burying a plan to halve chemical pesticide use by the end of this decade. She acknowledged that the proposal had â€œbecome a symbol of polarisationâ€, with the legislation stalling amid divisions between EU lawmakers and member countries. Rising discontent could hamper attempts to adopt the 2040 goal of 90 percent emission cuts.The Commission stated that the new target would reduce premature deaths that occur each year due to poor air quality from 466,000 in 2015 to 196,000 in 2040. It also considers that the proposal sends â€œclear signalsâ€ and that the clean technology market will grow to approximately 600 billion euros in 2030. Brussels says that the EU currently allocates four percent of its GDP to importing hydrocarbons, and it points out that between 2030 and 2050 the EU will have to invest an additional 1.5 percent of gross domestic product annually in the energy transition. It therefore suggests freeing up resources by moving them away â€œfrom less sustainable uses, such as fossil fuel subsidiesâ€.The proposal, which will fuel the pre-electoral debate, must be approved by the member states and the European Parliament. It slightly softens the level of ambition compared to previous drafts and removes direct references to the efforts that the agricultural sector must make.Far-right and anti-establishment parties have latched onto the farmersâ€™ movement and are predicted to make big gains in the EU June elections. Matteo Salvini, the leader of the Italian right-wing and anti-European League party, used the farmersâ€™ protests across Europe to take a swipe at the EU. â€œLong live the farmers, whose tractors are forcing Europe to go back on the madness imposed by the multinationals and the left,â€ he said.Â BacklashThere is an increasingly vocal backlash from some industries to the EUâ€™s climate policies and several national leaders are now calling for a â€œpauseâ€ in new environmental rules.Eleven EU countries, on the initiative of Denmark, including France, Germany, Spain and Slovenia had sent a joint letter to Brussels saying that the transition for an â€œambitiousâ€ 2040 target needs to be â€œfair and justâ€ and â€œleave no-one behind, especially the most vulnerable citizensâ€.Ambition fell short for environmental groups But for environmental groups, the Commissionâ€™s ambition fell well short of what was needed, for instance the absence of a target date for phasing out fossil fuels and related subsidies. â€œThis is about as meaningful as a target to prevent lung cancer without any plan to end smoking,â€ said Greenpeace campaigner Silvia Pastorelli.With the UNâ€™s climate change body vying to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and â€œconsidering the EUâ€™s responsibility for historical emissions, it would be fairer to aim for zero net emissions by 2040â€, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) group said.It lamented the Commission dropping a goal of cutting agricultural emissions –– which account for 11 percent of overall EU emissions – by 30 percent, as had been evoked in a previous working document.The European Consumer Organisation BEUC said that â€œhowever hard the Commission tries to handle farmers with kid gloves, facts are stubborn things: our food and agriculture systems contribute a big chunk of the EUâ€™s climate impactâ€.Bulgariaâ€™s farmers Bulgariaâ€™s government negotiated with the Bulgarian National Grain Producers Association and according to Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov there is already consensus with farmers on the main points. However, after the meeting on February 4, the farmers started protests on Tuesday and blocked roads across the country, as they say they disagree with some of the points.The main demands of the grain growers are legislative amendments to ensure economic security in the sector, an effort to change the conditions of the European Green Deal, and an allowance of BGN 200 per hectare (about 100 euros) to mitigate the effects of the war in Ukraine. According to farmers, the Bulgarian government should push for equalising the subsidies and the support for grain producers across the EU. In addition, they want changes and a relaxation of rules in the EU Green Deal that require crop rotation and diversification and minimising the share of arable land designated for non-production purposes. Denkov said that he agreed on negotiations with the European Commission for easing the new environmental requirements.Denmarkâ€™s Climate Minister Aagaard welcomes EUâ€™s new 2040 targetThe Danish Minister for Climate Lars Aagaard said that the Commissionâ€™s announcement comes at a moment where there is a battle for the climate in the EU: â€œWe see demonstrations in European capitals and governments scaling back their ambitions,â€ he said. He added that â€œthis is happening in countries that have traditionally been ambitious on the climate agenda. But we must not lose the battle, and I am therefore pleased that the Commission is following Denmarkâ€™s recommendation to set an ambitious targetâ€.He rejected the idea that the announcement could damage the credibility of the new climate target since the first climate target has not yet been finalised. â€œCreating confidence that climate policy will continue after 2030 creates credibility for the 2030 target,â€ he said. The new, high target comes at a time when several countries are already struggling to meet the 2030 target of a 55 percent reduction. Denmark, too, has yet to show the way to a significant amount of CO2 reduction.A farmer drives a tractor over a barley field and sprays pesticides. Photo: Julian Stratenschulte/dpaSlovenia and Italy welcomed EUâ€™s withdrawal of the pesticide regulationItalian Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida also welcomed von der Leyenâ€™s announcement to withdraw the proposal for a regulation on pesticides on Tuesday. â€œWe should only further limit agrochemicals when we are able to protect production with alternative methods,â€ he said. â€œFrom day one we have opposed an ideological approach to the issue (of the ecological transition) that would have had a devastating effect on production and a very limited effect on the environment.â€ Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni called the withdrawal â€œalso an Italian victoryâ€.Following the announcement of the Commission President, Slovenia will also advocate for the individual treatment of pesticide use, said the newly appointed Minister for Agriculture Mateja ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡. The minister also stressed that the agricultural areas in Slovenia are fragmented, and before adopting a regulation, one needs to know what are the alternatives to protect crops.Â Slovenia will have to step up its efforts to meet the Commissionâ€™s recommendation, Environment Ministry State Secretary UroÅ¡ Vajgl said on Tuesday. Vajgl believes the new 2040 target is achievable, but there needs to be a discussion on how to reach it.Â Slovenian farmer representatives met Minister ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡ on Tuesday who brought some solutions about direct payments. He said it would endorse the Commissionâ€™s proposal under which farmers would be exempt from having to leave some land uncultivated in 2024 while they would still receive financial support. What now?The Commission stressed that while the target is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 90 percent by 2040 compared to 1990 levels, the competitiveness of European industry must also be ensured and a strategic dialogue with industry and farmers must take place. The target for 2040 is not a legislative proposal, but initially a recommendation. Eventually, the new target will also function as a roadmap for the upcoming Commission and will guide long-term investments in the race for green technology in which the United States, China, the European Union and other developed economies are immersed.Meanwhile, farmers across the bloc carry on with protests. Fact Checks: Misinformation about climate proposals onlineClimate protection and energy transition is not only energising farmers, but the EUâ€™s climate proposals also lead to widespread public debate. Online, misleading information or outright fake news create a climate of mistrust. For example the European Commission also wants new rules for recycling and exporting old cars, this proposal turned into the opposite online.The German Press Agency dpa has published a number of fact checks on topics related to the EUâ€™s measures to reduce carbon emissions.

EU law on violence against women divides bloc over key component,"EU member states and the European Parliament have agreed on the blocâ€™s first-ever law to combat violence against women. But the final text fell short on one key element: the inclusion of a common definition of rape. Despite legislative efforts, violence against women and domestic violence persist across the European continent.After months of intense negotiations, the EU has agreed on its piece of legislation to combat violence against women and girls, a comprehensive directive that aims to harmonise legal definitions and minimum prison sentences for offenders all over the EU.The law seeks to protect women in the 27-nation EU from gender-based violence, forced marriages, female genital mutilation and online harassment. The text criminalises cyber-stalking, cyber-harassment and cyber-incitement to hatred or violence across the Union. The European Commission first proposed the major legislation on March 8, 2022, to mark International Womenâ€™s Day.The latest agreement does not, however, include a common definition of rape, which proved to be the most controversial point in the negotiations.European Parliamentâ€™s chief negotiators for the file, Swedish MEP Evin Incir (S&D) and Irish MEP Frances Fitzgerald (EPP), did not hide their disappointment during a press conference in Strasbourg and hoped the directive will become â€œthe beginning, not the endâ€ of legislation to fight violence against women in the EU.Negotiations tainted by rape definition disputeThe step to include a common definition of rape, urged by many, was blocked by several EU countries, led by France, Germany, Austria and the Netherlands. They entrenched themselves behind technical-legal reasons on how to adopt the proposal, arguing that rape is not a â€œEuropean crimeâ€. Other traditionally conservative countries such as Poland, Hungary, Malta, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Bulgaria and Slovakia took the same line.The European Parliament and at least a dozen EU countries including Belgium, Greece, Italy and Spain had wanted to include a definition of rape based on the absence of explicit consent. Four Spanish MEPs have been part of the European Parliamentâ€™s negotiating team and three of them have been vocal about the need to bring European legislation up to speed with the standards in countries like Spain.The states in opposition of defining rape in the text argued that the EU has no competence in the matter. Critics of the rape definition argued that there was no legal basis for such a standardised regulation in European law. A corresponding article therefore did not make it into the law. Germany and France believed that the risk of including a definition is that it could be overturned by an EU court following a legal challenge.The reluctance to agree a definition of rape sparked controversy in France, where President Emmanuel Macron had said tackling violence against women would be a priority of his second term. Macron had already elicited criticism after defending the presumption of innocence for French actor GÃ©rard Depardieu, who has been charged with rape and sexual harassment.Although the text does not contain a definition of rape, member states will aim to raise awareness that non-consensual sex is considered a criminal offence, the European Parliament said in a statement. The European Commission will have to report every five years on whether the rules need to be updated, it added.Building on the Istanbul ConventionEuropean Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ told the Czech News Agency CTK that the directive replaces the Istanbul Convention in a way.â€œWe have never had such a directive on violence against women. It is also a reaction to the fact that not all EU countries have ratified the Istanbul Convention on which I have been counting for years to be a safeguard against violence targeting women, and against domestic violence.â€VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, European Commission Vice-President for Values and TransparencyThe Vice-President for Values and Transparency JourovÃ¡ said she did not understand why the Czech Republic has not ratified the Convention yet. â€œI am sorry. I think that alarmists and disinformers have won over common sense,â€ she said, adding that the Czech Republic has thus joined the group of countries â€œwhere the church has a huge influence and would like to return life to the 19th century.""The Istanbul Convention recognises violence against women as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women, committing the country to take legislative and other measures to ensure a legal, institutional, and organisational framework for preventing violence against women, protecting victims, and punishing perpetrators.Other countries that have not ratified the Istanbul convention include Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia. To put things in perspective, non-EU member Bosnia and Herzegovina already ratified the Istanbul Convention in 2013. Accordingly, gender-based violence should be punishable by law in the country.A woman holds her hands in front of her face (staged scene). (to dpa: ""EU agreement on tougher measures against violence against women"") Photo: Fabian Sommer/dpaAcross Europe, violence against women persistsDespite pledges to implement the Istanbul convention, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been shaken by increasingly frequent murders of women over the past year. Following the latest murder in the northern part of the country, thousands of citizens held a peaceful protest walk, and a day of mourning was declared. However, the most prominent outcry from the public was sparked by a triple murder in August, where the perpetrator killed his wife in a live broadcast on social media and, in another video, claimed he had killed two others as well.In the rest of Europe, violence against women and domestic violence also remain persistent problems. â€œIt is a systemic problem, with deep roots in the social structures and in many cases it reflects the failure of the protection system that should ensure the security and integrity of half of the countryâ€™s population.""Raisa Enachi, chairwoman of the Committee for equal opportunities for women and men in the Chamber of Deputies of RomaniaAccording to the latest data from the Slovenian National Statistical Office, women are three times more likely to be victims of violence in an intimate relationship than men. Women are also more likely to be victims of serious forms of violence. The Slovenian police deal with just over 1,000 cases of crimes with elements of domestic violence annually. More than 90 percent of the perpetrators are male and the victims are predominantly women and children, according to the helpline Association SOS hotline for Women and Children Victims of Violence.The head of the European Commissionâ€™s representation in Sofia, Boyko Blagoev, has cited Eurostat data, according to which 21 percent of women in Bulgaria who have ever had a relationship have experienced intimate partner violence during their adult life. Deputy Prime Minister Mariya Gabriel said in January that more than 20 women had been killed by men in Bulgaria in 2023. The number of registered cases of domestic violence was almost 1,400, she added.In September last year, the Bulgarian government decided to appoint Gabriel as head of the National Council for Prevention and Protection from Domestic Violence, whose members were designated by the government on February 7, 2024. The council includes ministers, representatives of government agencies and NGOs and is focused on the implementation of the state policy to combat domestic violence.For the EU directive on violence against women to come into force, it still needs to be approved by member state ministers and passed by the plenary of the European Parliament, but it is expected to pass smoothly. Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ expects the directive to be finally adopted by the end of April.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Eurozone inflation expected to slow down,"In its latest economic forecast, the European Commission expects inflation in the eurozone to fall. The EU announced support for a 6.4-million-euro migration management project in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Swiss parliament voted to resume negotiations with the EU.European Commission sees inflation falling faster than expectedBrussels (Belga) – Eurozone inflation declined faster than expected in the autumn of 2023 and will probably continue its downward trend in 2024. By the end of 2025, inflation should only just exceed the European Central Bankâ€™s (ECB) 2 percent target. This is what the European Commission wrote in its latest economic forecast published on Thursday.Eurozone inflation stood at 5.4 percent in 2023 and is likely to fall to 2.7 percent in 2024. By the end of next year, average price increases in euro countries should amount to 2.2 percent. In Belgium, inflation was 2.3 percent last year. This year, the Commission expects 3.5 percent, with 2.3 percent projected for next year.Only Austria is forecast to record higher price increases this year (4.0 percent). Slovakia (3.5 percent) is projected to be at Belgium's level. According to the Commission, the fact that inflation is likely to rise again only in Belgium has to do with the expiry of various government interventions to dampen the effect of rising energy prices. Next year, Belgium is expected to fall back towards the eurozone average, resulting in a corresponding drop in the eurozone ranking. That, in turn, will probably be the result of a slow rise in energy prices.Inflation in the euro area declined more steeply than expected last year due to the sharp reduction in energy prices. This year, the downward trend will probably be held back by the expiry of the member states' support measures in the context of the energy crisis and disruptions to trade flows.Economic growth in the euro area is projected to remain weak in the first half of 2024, before stabilising from the second half of the year until the end of 2025. Eurozone growth should amount to 0.8 percent this year and 1.5 percent next year; with a forecast growth of 1.4 percent in 2024 and 1.5 percent in 2025 for Belgium.While last autumn the Commission assumed that the eurozone economy would grow by 0.6 percent in 2023, it has now adjusted this to 0.5 per cent. The forecast for this year is also being adjusted: the Commission no longer expects growth of 1.2 percent, but 0.8 percent. In 2025, the eurozone economy is expected to grow by 1.5 per cent.The Belgian economy grew by 1.5 percent in 2023 and should remain stable at 1.4 percent and 1.5 per cent respectively in 2024 and 2025. This year, the countryâ€™s growth rate should be in the middle range, but next year only a handful of other eurozone countries are likely to record lower growth. With Germany (1.2 percent), Italy (1.2 percent) and France (1.3 percent), these do include Europe's largest economies.Looking back at 2023, European Commissioner for Economy Paolo Gentiloni said that the European economy has had a particularly challenging year. The Italian does point out that geopolitical tensions, an unstable environment with increasingly unpredictable weather phenomena and a number of important elections, such as in the US, make the forecast for 2024 uncertain. (15 February)EU support for project to strengthen border management in Bosnia and HerzegovinaSarajevo (FENA) – The European Union has announced support for a project worth 6.4 million euros to strengthen border and migration management in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The importance of supporting the project is significant due to the increase in the number of migrant arrivals in BiH in the last few years and the need for improvements in management techniques, which burdened the country's ability to effectively deal with mixed migration flows and border management.Since 2017, the number of migrants passing through BiH has increased 1.6-fold, with continued rises in 2022 and 2023. This highlights the urgent need for improved management strategies to address the challenges facing BiH. Although efforts have been made since 2018 to improve the country's border and migration management capacity, challenges remain due to limited technical capacity and cooperation between different agencies and organisations.To address these issues, this EU-funded project will focus on improving integrated border management in line with human rights standards. The project will also be aligned with the EU Action Plan for the Western Balkans and relevant strategies in BiH. Its general objective is to improve integrated border management and strengthen its capacities for the effective implementation of migration policies in accordance with EU standards.The EU is already providing support to BiHâ€™s Ministry of Security and responsible agencies through the joint programme ""Individual measure to strengthen response capacity to manage migration flows in BiH"". To date, this support has included procurement of specialised equipment, training of civil servants and operational support. The new project will be implemented by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in close cooperation with the Ministry of Security of Bosnia and Herzegovina. (14 February)Switzerland: Parliamentarians give the green light to the resumption of negotiations with the EUZurich (AFP) – On Tuesday, two parliamentary committees gave the green light to the Swiss government to resume negotiations with the European Union, while voicing numerous criticisms of the thorny draft agreement aimed at regulating relations with the Alpine country's biggest trading partner.Relations between Switzerland and the EU are governed by numerous bilateral agreements, but in 2021 Bern had slammed the door on negotiations for a comprehensive agreement.Following a resumption of talks in mid-2022, the Federal Council (government) published a joint document with the EU last December, setting out a basis for negotiations that was already very detailed in a number of areas, ranging from questions of freedom of movement to electricity and integration into major European research programmes.Many employers' organisations had urged Bern to resume negotiations, given that the EU is Switzerland's biggest trading partner. But the new draft still meets with resistance from the radical right and the unions. (13 February)This is a compilation of the European coverage of enr news agencies. It is published on Fridays.

Doubts over US leadership prompt further calls for stronger EU defenceÂ ,"With Donald Trumpâ€™s recent NATO comments igniting a political firestorm among the alliance's members and further US funding for Ukraine looking set to be rejected in the Republican-led lower house, European leaders call for stronger European efforts to ensure the security of the continent. Donald Trump, former US President and the presumptive Republican nominee for the November US election, said at a campaign event that he would â€œencourageâ€ Russia â€œto do whatever the hell they wantâ€ to NATO countries that are not spending enough on defence.Trumpâ€™s comments about the US-led military alliance – brash even by his standards of long-term NATO-bashing – drew alarm from allies and fierce condemnation from the White House with US President Joe Biden condemning the comments as â€œdumbâ€ and â€œshamefulâ€.NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg warned that â€œany suggestion that allies will not defend each other undermines all of our security, including that of the USâ€. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said that â€œNATO cannot be an Ã  la carte military allianceâ€, adding that it was either existing or not existing. Spanish Minister of Defence Margarita Robles said that the alliance â€œwill not accept any act that could involve a violation of the minimum rights included in international law and in the UN Charter of Rightsâ€.Diplomats from multiple NATO countries insist that keeping the United States on board remains fundamental to deterring the threat from Russia. But they remain sanguine about how genuine Trumpâ€™s threats are, arguing the alliance emerged from his first term unscathed.â€œUnprecedented riseâ€ in defence spending, doubts over future US aid for Ukraine Stoltenberg said on Wednesday that 18 of the allianceâ€™s 31 countries are set to hit their defence spending target this year. Spurred on by Russiaâ€™s all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, last year saw an â€œunprecedented riseâ€ of 11 percent in spending by European members and Canada, the NATO chief added. Overall, he said European allies and Canada will have added more than $600 billion to their defence spending since they set the two-percent goal of their GDP a decade ago. The United States still accounts for the vast bulk of combined defence spending by NATO members.â€œWe should leave no room for miscalculation or misunderstanding in Moscow about our readiness and our commitment, our resolve to protect allies,â€ Stoltenberg said. NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea GeoanÄƒ stated in early February: â€We will continue to support Ukraine. This is not the time to become pessimistic about what will happen in this war, which will be two years old in a few days. We have the resources, we have the will to make Ukraine succeed. It is very important that we remain united and continue to support this country, because their fight is our fight, their security also protects our security.â€Moscowâ€™s full-scale war on Ukraine has served as a wake-up call for European countries and saw NATO turn the two-percent figure into a minimum requirement rather than a goal. Key players such as Germany have ramped up their spending and are set to meet the target this year. Spain aims to reach two percent by 2029. Spanish Minister of Defence Robles said the government was making an â€œextremely important effortâ€ in terms of defence investment, adding that the 2023 budget was â€œa very high increaseâ€ in comparison to the year before.Celebrating its 20th NATO membership anniversary this year, Sloveniaâ€™s defence expenditure is estimated to reach 1.31 percent of its GDP. The country plans to raise defence spending to twoÂ percent by 2030. The modernisation of the Slovenian Armed Forces gained momentum in recent years but investment plans were impacted by the catastrophic floods last year.Â On Thursday, Stoltenberg said he was welcoming the uptake in defence investments by the European allies but also that this was not an alternative to NATO but a way to strengthen it. The NATO chief underlined that the strength was to have Europe and North America in NATO together. While there is a focus on NATOâ€™s own defence spending, the pressing issue of support for Ukraine was also on the table at the meeting on Wednesday.The US Senate a day before approved long-delayed funding for Ukraineâ€™s war effort, but the package looks set to be rejected by the Republican-led lower house. Doubts over the future of US aid come as Ukraine says its forces are being outgunned in the face of a slow-moving Russian advance along the front line.Nine months before Joe Biden stands for reelection in November, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken takes part in the Munich Security Conference alongside Vice President Kamala Harris. He faces an uphill climb to quell doubts on US leadership. The conference which starts on Friday brings together the worldâ€™s elite defence policy makers each year and is seen as a barometer on transatlantic relations. â€œItâ€™s very clear to me wherever I go, and when I speak to people, that people watching the US appear very nervous,â€ said Comfort Ero, head of the International Crisis Group think-tank.â€œI think the US is still seen as an influential player – both positively and negatively – internationally. But I think increasingly thereâ€™s alarm, thereâ€™s concern, there is uneasiness, about the uncertainty, the unpredictability, just the polarisation, the division,â€ she said.Calls for stronger European stance on security within NATOOn Monday, European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said more needed to be done in terms of individual countriesâ€™ defence spending, but Europe would send a â€œclear message irrespective of who will lead the next American administrationâ€ that the EU is â€œstrong enough to be able to defend each otherâ€.â€œThe biggest asset of the West against Putin is our unity. The last thing we should do is to throw that away,â€ Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo reacted to Trumpâ€™s comments. However, De Croo acknowledged that Europe has the responsibility to take its security in its own hands. â€œIn the years to come we have to build a stronger European pillar within NATO.â€ While Belgium is among those with the worst track record on defence spending in years, De Croo insists that this trend has been reversed. â€œYear after year, Belgium is spending more money on defence now,â€ the prime minister said. â€œBut we also have to look at the way this spending is happening, so as to make sure that our own industry, in Belgium and in Europe, will be able to grow as well.â€ In late January, Bulgarian defence minister Todor Tagarev stressed that â€œthe European Defence Industrial Strategy should outline effective ways to overcome the EUâ€™s dependencies on raw materials, energy and critical technologies, as well as introduce measures and instruments to increase the production of defence products, promote innovation and competitiveness of the defence sectorâ€. Emmanuel Macron (r), President of France, receives Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, at the Elysee Palace. Polish Prime Minister Tusk travelled to Paris and Berlin to try to re-establish important alliances at diplomatic level. Photo: Aurelien Morissard/AP/dpaFrance-Germany-Poland: Revived Weimar triangle â€œnew boostâ€ for EUEarlier this week, new Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk visited German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris to coordinate foreign policy cooperation between the countries and ramp up security cooperation in Europe.Scholz also said at the joint press conference that Germany and Poland were working together. Solidarity and joint action were indispensable. The German chancellor said: â€œEspecially at a time when Russiaâ€™s imperialism is threatening our common security in Europe. That is why we stand up for each other in the EU and in NATO.â€Tusk emphasised that the EU was superior to Russia in economic and financial terms. â€œIt is certainly not the lack of money that will decide the fate of this war, this confrontation between Russia and Ukraine.â€ However, Tusk added, greater determination is needed to use Europeâ€™s wealth for security and defence.Macron praised Tusk and his government as â€œtrusted, pro-European partnersâ€ who are â€œclear on European securityâ€. He also reiterated calls to strengthen the European defence industry.â€œThis is what will also make it possible to make Europe a security and defence power complementary to NATO, the European pillar of the Atlantic alliance,â€ he said. In January, the French president called on European countries to get ready to back Ukraine in case Washington decides to pull the plug on aid.Separately, newly appointed French Foreign Minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© hosted German counterpart Annalena Baerbock and RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski of Poland just outside Paris. The meeting, held in the so-called Weimar Triangle format, included a discussion on deepening foreign policy and security cooperation.The format is an alliance the three nations created in 1991 in order to work together on European issues. Scholz hailed the revived partnership of the trio as â€œvery important to all of usâ€, calling for â€œnew momentumâ€ behind the Weimar Triangle to provide a â€œnew boostâ€ to the European Union. Europe needs another â€œlife insuranceâ€ policy in addition to NATO, SÃ©journÃ© said, following the comments by Trump. â€œYes, we need a second life insurance, not in substitution to or against NATO but in additionâ€ to the alliance, he said. SÃ©journÃ© insisted that it was necessary to build on the European element of NATO and build up its own defence industry and â€œbuy European within the framework of our defence industries and prepare in the event of conflictâ€.â€œWe need to take care of the security of Ukrainians, and that means taking care of our security, and yes, I think we need a union of defence and security, with joint purchases and pooling our forces,â€ Annalena Baerbock added.This article is published weekly.

A fragile EU unity amidst numerous crises?Â ,"The Middle East, Ukraine and the Sahel â€“ the EU is confronted with numerous crises at once. The EU High Representative Josep Borrell, is thus calling for more unity and wants to heighten the EUâ€™s ability to defend itself, if it wants to play a geopolitical role. At the Munich Security Conference, the EUâ€™s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, stressed that the EUâ€™s geopolitical agenda is being shaped by â€œthree geographical challenges which are Ukraine, Gaza, and the Global Southâ€. In addition the European defence has suffered â€œa long period of silent disarmamentâ€.He warned that â€œRussia will be tempted to increase its political and military provocations against NATO countriesâ€. He added: â€œSo the message is clear: We have a Russian problem ahead.â€ Portuguese Foreign Minister JoÃ£o Gomes Cravinho stressed on Tuesday that Russian President Vladimir Putin â€œdoesnâ€™t just want a piece of Ukrainian territory, he wants to destroy the European project and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s crucial that we donâ€™t allow him to win in Ukraineâ€.The EUâ€™s chief diplomat Borrell stressed that â€œthe war in Ukraine and in Gaza has increased tremendously the political space of the Global South vis-a-vis usâ€. A confrontation between â€œthe rest against the Westâ€ must be avoided, since â€œfor Russia, this new geopolitical scenario has dramatically increased its positionâ€ since Israelâ€™s response after October 7, he warned.Given the Israel-Hamas war, after a meeting of the bloc's foreign affairs ministers on Monday, Borrell called for more unity in the EU, if the bloc wants to play a geopolitical role in the Middle East. He said he saw â€œdispersion of approaches and many member states want to play their own gameâ€.Â Call for humanitarian pause in Gaza strip vetoed by HungaryOn Monday at the Foreign Affairs Council, all EU countries except Hungary called for an â€œimmediate humanitarian pause that would lead to a sustainable ceasefire, to the unconditional release of hostages, and to the provision of humanitarian assistanceâ€. However, it was the first time since October 7, 2023,  that the vast majority of EU member states had been able to reach a consensus for a ceasefire in Gaza. â€œI know very well that if there is no unanimity, there is no position of the European Union, but there can be a sufficiently majority position, which without being formally a position of the European Union, represents the majority position. And 26 out of 27 certainly is,â€ Borrell said. Sanctions against Israeli settlers in the West BankAfter Hungary blocked on Monday the EU from approving sanctions against Israeli settlers who have attacked Palestinians in the West Bank, now Spain, France, Ireland and Belgium have decided to impose sanctions on violent Israeli settlers unilaterally. â€œI have been pushing for it [unanimity] during the meeting, one state did not want to join. There were 26 of us who agreed,â€ Spanish Foreign Minister JosÃ© Manuel Albares said. The Spanish government is preparing an initial list of dozens of people who have carried out violent acts against Palestinians in the West Bank, according to Albares, who added that the sanction will consist of a ban on entry to Spain.Other European countries, such as Ireland and Belgium, have also signalled their willingness to impose sanctions on individual settlers, something the United States has already done.At the same time, Albares assured that Spain will continue collaborating with the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees, UNRWA, and confirmed that they are preparing a new package of financial support in addition to the 3.5 million euros already announced and the ten million delivered in December.â€œThe work of this organisation is essential to meet the needs of almost six million displaced Palestinians,â€ not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank and other countries in the region, he said, and stressed that its role â€œhas no possible substituteâ€.Albares indicated that he asked to have an evaluation carried out on a possible breach of international humanitarian law by Israel based on the association agreement of the community bloc with that country.EU launches Red Sea mission In response to the attacks by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen on the Red Sea shipping route, the EU decided on Monday to formally launch a naval mission to protect shipping in the area. The dozens of Houthi attacks have roiled shipping in the Red Sea, forcing some companies to take alternative routes including a two-week detour around the tip of southern Africa. The Houthis have been harassing the vital shipping lane since November in a campaign they say is in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas war.The European Union aims to have the mission called Aspides (ancient Greek for â€œshieldâ€) and running in a â€œfew weeksâ€ with at least four vessels, an official said on February 16, 2024.â€œEurope will ensure freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, working alongside our international partners,â€ European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post  on X.https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1759531273024913800â€œThe constant attacks of the Houthi rebels threaten global trade and of course endanger our ships. And I say â€˜our shipsâ€™ because Greece has the largest fleet of any other country in terms of commercial shipping and that is why Greece immediately stood in favour of coordinated action by taking over the regular command of the European defence operation â€˜Aspidesâ€™ from the Headquarters of Larissa,â€ said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.The United States is already spearheading its own naval coalition in the area and has conducted retaliatory strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen, as has Britain. Egyptâ€™s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi said that revenues from the Suez Canal, which links the Red Sea with the Mediterranean, had fallen â€œ40 to 50 percentâ€ so far this year. The canal, which brought in 8.6 billion dollars (7.95 million euros) in the 2022-23 fiscal year, is a vital source of foreign currency for Cairo, which is suffering from a severe financial crisis.So far France, Germany, Italy and Belgium have said they plan to contribute ships. The overall commander of the EU mission will be Greek, while the lead officer in operational control at sea will be Italian.The EU says the missionâ€™s mandate, set initially for one year, is limited to protecting civilian shipping in the Red Sea and that no attacks will be carried out â€œon Yemeni soilâ€.Germanyâ€™s Defence Minister Boris Pistorius sees the dangerous deployment of the frigate â€œHessenâ€ in the Red Sea as a sign that Germany is willing and able to take on international responsibility but called the mission also â€œthe most dangerous deployment of the navy in decadesâ€. The German military frigate ""Hessen"" heads towards the Red Sea, February 8 2024. Foto: Sina Schuldt/dpaNATOâ€™s Eastern flank: Bulgaria and Czech RepublicFollowing the Munich Security Conference, Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said after conferring with US Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, that Bulgaria is a key country in the efforts to protect the Black Sea region, and NATOâ€™s Eastern flank. Bulgariaâ€™s prime minister pointed out that the current problems could be used as opportunities for the development of the region and for positioning Bulgaria and NATO in a way that would ensure stability. â€œWe are very committed and that is why we are here with Mariya Gabriel [Bulgariaâ€™s deputy premier] to work together where Bulgaria belongs – in the structures of Europe and NATO, as a reliable partner,â€ Denkov emphasised.The Czech President Petr Pavel said at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday that the Czech Republic had found sources abroad for hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, which it could deliver to Ukraine within weeks if it and its partners in the United States, Germany, Sweden or other countries could secure funding. Czech Defence Minister Jana ÄŒernochovÃ¡ added that the countries that could cooperate on the ammunition shipments are making participation conditional on not disclosing specific details about them.Fact CheckRussian disinformation: Fake news against Ukraine supportSince the Russian invasion of Ukraine, disinformation has been an important part of the Russian arsenal. After nearly two years of war, Moscow's propagandists have shifted their focus to undermining Western support for Kyiv, recognising its central role in maintaining Ukraine's resilience. Recent investigations by the AFP news agency have unveiled falsehoods, ranging from fake anti-Ukrainian posters in New York to forged documents alleging lavish property acquisitions by Ukraine's leadership.Here is a fact check in German on Russian disinformation: https://faktencheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34JE8CY This article is published weekly.

Two years of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine,"February 24 marks the two-year anniversary of Vladimir Putinâ€™s troops invading Ukraine. It comes as Ukrainian forces are losing ground and the future of support from their key ally USA remains in doubt. The EU agreed on the 13th round of sanctions, also aiming at presenting its framework for EU accession talks with Ukraine by the â€œbeginning of summerâ€.â€œI am happy to be here today and to see you,â€ Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said as he presented medals to combat troops near the eastern front during a ceremony close to the city of Kupiansk in the war-battered Kharkiv region on Monday. However, for months Ukraine's battlefield momentum has been stalled. Zelensky recently replaced much of the military leadership in the most significant shake-up since the war began. He, for example, parted ways with popular army chief Valery Zaluzhny credited with the Ukrainianâ€™s army stunning success in holding out against a vastly more powerful Russian military at the onset of the war which is seen as a sign of the first serious split within the leadership. Further, a controversial bill making its way through parliament contains stiffer penalties for draft dodgers and lowers the age of service. The military says it needs up to half a million people to boost their dwindling ranks and reprieve exhausted frontline troops.In addition to this, Ukraineâ€™s forces at the weekend withdrew from Avdiivka, a town in the Donetsk region that had been fiercely contested. Avdiivka had become a new symbol of Ukrainian resistance during Moscowâ€™s months-long onslaught on the town which it had been trying to take since a Russian-backed rebellion began in eastern Ukraine in 2014. But the outgunned and outnumbered Ukrainians were eventually forced to pull out of the ruined town, where under 1,000 residents remained out of a pre-war population of around 30,000.The conquest of the town by Russian troops may not be strategically significant, but it could be exploited by the Kremlin for propaganda purposes ahead of the Russian presidential election in March, according to experts from the US Institute for the Study of War. The last time Ukraine had to give up a town or city was after the battle of Bakhmut in spring 2023, a battle which also lasted for months.Analysts: Only ramped up Western support for Ukraine can change shifted momentum After two years of war in Ukraine, there is no prospect of negotiations to find a breakthrough as Russian President Vladimir Putin, emboldened by the erosion of Western support for Kyiv, girds for a long conflict. Analysts and diplomats say 2024 will be another year of war because Ukraine is determined to keep on fighting to recapture territory, while Putin will only be satisfied with Kyivâ€™s full surrender.A Republican holdup on US military aid and Europeâ€™s inability to ramp up weapons supplies fast enough contribute to a sense of uncertainty and gloom in Kyiv. In an effort to shore up support from European partners, Zelensky recently visited leaders in Paris and Berlin and signed security agreements with both. A month prior, the Ukrainian president secured a deal with the United Kingdom and is currently in talks with Italy. He appealed for the US Congress to approve a stalled military aid package in a meeting with US Vice President Kamala Harris at the Munich Security Conference.  On the other side, Putin had made increasingly bullish statements, declaring in December that Ukraine â€œdoes not have a futureâ€ and – in a recent interview with controversial right-wing US talk show host Tucker Carlson – that a strategic defeat of Russia is â€œimpossible by definitionâ€.European leaders increasingly recognise that if Putin is allowed to win in Ukraine, he could then be tempted to test NATOâ€™s defences. â€œWe have a â€˜Russian problemâ€™ ahead of us and for us itâ€™s a huge challenge,â€ said European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell. French president Emmanuel Macron warned last month that Europeâ€™s priority must be to â€œnot let Russia winâ€.Security and military support is currently the most important, said the Slovenian State Secretary at the Ministry of Defence, Damir ÄŒrnÄec, at a recent round table organised by the Centre for European Future.At the Munich Security Conference, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said: â€œWe must ensure that on Saturday, when the war has lasted two years, Ukraine receives more deliveries. Specific deliveries on the ground. Itâ€™s about ammunition, artillery, long-range missiles, drones and more for the coalition of F-16 aircraft.â€ She also said that words would not solve the situation. Analysts say only drastically ramped up Western support for Ukraine as it runs out of munitions can change the momentum. â€œIt is a race by both sides to rebuild their offensive capacity,â€ said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for New American Security (CNAS). â€œIf the Western funding does not come through, if Russia gains some sort of advantage, then they have the possibility of making some more gains,â€ she said. â€œThe momentum has shifted.â€â€œThe Bulgarian Government and the parliamentary majority in Bulgaria will continue to support Ukraine and its people, both through national efforts and through international forms of cooperation, EU and NATO structures, for as long as necessary,â€ Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov said in Paris on February 21.Tensions at the Poland-Ukraine border In a sign of possibly increasing European disunity in their stance to support Ukraine at all costs, Polish farmers have been trying to block lorries carrying Ukrainian grain. Their dissatisfaction is directed against EU agricultural policy, but also against the import of cheap agricultural products from Ukraine. Roads into Poland, an EU member, have been an export lifeline for Ukraine, which is also relying on imported Western military aid to be transported through Poland. Zelensky called on the Polish government for a meeting to resolve the issue. Poland is one of Ukraineâ€™s strongest supporters in the war and Polandâ€™s Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Thursday that border crossings with neighbouring Ukraine would be considered â€œcritical infrastructureâ€ to safeguard the passage of aid to the war-torn country. Tusk refused to meet at the border but a meeting will be held on March 28 in Warsaw. EU: Keeping â€œthe pressure high on the Kremlinâ€, resilient Russian economy The European Union has imposed unprecedented sanctions on Russia in the two years of its war and has so far put some 2,000 officials and entities on its blacklist. On Wednesday, the EU agreed to a new round of sanctions on Russia, after having recently approved a new 50-billion Euro package of assistance. Welcoming the decision, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on X that the latest salvo of sanctions keeps â€œthe pressure high on the Kremlinâ€. https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1760237371671400454EU representatives in Brussels signed off on the package, which targets persons and organisations linked to the Russian government and the Russian invasion. Almost 200 people have been included in the 13th package, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said. The package also includes measures to clamp down on sanctions evasion, he said.The latest measures are directed at the Russian weapons industryâ€™s access to components to manufacture drones, EU diplomats said. Companies in the bloc would not be allowed to sell goods and technologies with military connections to Russia. The sanctions agreement now goes to EU capitals for final legal approval. Persons and organisations will then be listed in the EU Official Journal to take effect on Saturday. Despite the economic punishment, Russiaâ€™s economy has remained resilient and the Kremlin has managed to ramp up military production.  According to an analysis by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) which was shared with CNN, Russia made a record 37 billion Dollar of crude oil sales to India last year, refined and then exported to the United States in the form of petroleum products worth more than one billion Dollar. The Kremlinâ€™s federal revenue jumped to a record 320 billion Dollar in 2023 and is set to rise further.But one reason for some optimism in the West may come from Russiaâ€™s own domestic weaknesses. Its economy is firmly on a war footing, there are signs of public fatigue with the duration of the conflict and it has suffered astronomical losses.Shrouding losses in secrecyThe human cost of the war in Ukraine, two years after the Russian invasion, is in the hundreds of thousands but the exact toll is unknown, with both sides shrouding their losses in secrecy, and Russia covering up civilian deaths in areas it has conquered.The BBC Russian Service and news outlet Mediazona said on February 21 that they had confirmed the identity of around 45,000 Russian soldiers who died in Ukraine since the invasion began. It included only the names of soldiers publicly identified in open-source data – mainly obituaries – and warned that the real toll could be twice as high.The Ukrainian army estimated on February 20 that it had killed or wounded more than 405,000 Russian troops since the invasion. In December 2023, Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said that his troops had killed or injured 383,000 Ukrainian soldiers.On Monday in Geneva, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said that at least 23,000 people are missing in Ukraine and that their fate is still unclear. They may have been arrested or abducted or died – or relatives lost track of each other when fleeing the conflict, the ICRC said.By the end of January, the ICRC had helped 8,000 Russian and Ukrainian families obtain information about the fate or whereabouts of their missing relatives, the organisation reported.This article is published weekly.

Europe in brief: Belgian EU Presidency to push for agreement on platform workers directive,"According to diplomatic sources, Belgium will once again attempt to reach an agreement on the EUâ€™s platform workers directive. The EU ambassador in Tirana stressed the need to promote a competitive economy in Albania. Bulgaria announced that it wants to benefit from a derogation from EU agricultural rules.Belgium makes ultimate attempt to save legislation on platform workersBrussels (Belga) – It is not yet over and done for the EU directive to give platform workers better working conditions. A political agreement between EU countries and the European Parliament already failed to be approved by the member states twice, but the Belgian EU Presidency is making an ultimate attempt to save the text. This was revealed by diplomatic sources on Wednesday.A first agreement failed to gain a majority during a vote in the Council. Spurred on by Belgium, which has presided over the Council since 1 January, negotiators from EU countries and the Parliament reached a new agreement a fortnight ago, but that text also subsequently failed to achieve the necessary qualified majority among member states. France voted against and Germany, Greece and Estonia abstained.At the next meeting of European employment ministers on 11 March, which will be chaired by Belgian federal minister Pierre-Yves Dermagne, a sufficient majority will again be sought, the sources said on Wednesday. There is not much room to manoeuvre, as the intention is to stay within the framework of the agreement with Parliament. The dossier will also already be discussed at the level of member state ambassadors in the coming days. If they find an agreement, ministers will only have to formally endorse it.The EU directive targets millions of people who work for digital platforms such as Uber, Deliveroo or Bolt. The European Union wants to tackle false self-employment in the sector and ensure that platform workers have a correct status. At the heart of the directive is a mechanism, based on a number of parameters that automatically determines whether a platform worker can keep his or her self-employed status, or is de facto employed and must therefore also be registered and treated as an employee. (20 February)Gonzato: Albania needs more clarity in the regulatory framework of the economyTirana (ATA) – The Ambassador of the European Union in Tirana, Silvio Gonzato, emphasised the need to promote a competitive economy in Albania during the meeting he held with Blendi Gonxhe, who leads the newly established Ministry of Economy, Culture and Innovation.""Albania needs better coordination of economic policies, more transparency and clarity in the regulatory framework, including investment policies, and a business environment friendly to innovation,"" said Gonzato at the meeting, emphasising that this would encourage competition.Gonzato assured Minister Gonxhe of the EU's sustained support for Albania's reforms in the field of economy, innovation and culture. (22 February)Bulgaria notifies Commission on wanting to benefit from derogation for non-arable landSofia/Brussels (BTA) – The Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture and Food has informed the European Commission that the country wants to benefit from a derogation for 2024 on the application of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC), which concerns the minimum share of agricultural land dedicated to non-productive areas. The GAEC standards are a set of European rules to protect and improve the environment and climate. Farmers must comply with these standards on their farms in order to receive financial support under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).On February 12, in the wake of agricultural protests across Europe, the European Commission had conceded the possibility of granting a derogation for 2024. The specific standard provides for a minimum share of at least 4 percent of arable farm land to be set aside for non-productive areas and special forms of cultivation, including land set aside for crops that enrich the soil with nitrogen and/or catch crops. The condition set by the Commission is that member states inform the Commission in due time if they want to benefit from the derogation.The derogation gives farmers greater flexibility in terms of areas, placing fewer restrictions on how farmers can use them, so that revenue losses are reduced, while the corresponding environmental benefits are ensured.The change allows farmers not to leave 4 percent of their farm land uncultivated this year and, if they wish, to grow a limited number of plants there. Farmers who plant the relevant area with nitrogen-fixing crops such as lentils, peas and broad beans, or catch crops, will be deemed to have met the requirements.

Third Press Pool Trip: enr in Ukraine with Ursula von der Leyen,"During the weekend of 23-25 February, the European Newsroom (enr) accompanied European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on another visit to Ukraine. On Saturday, February 24, it had been exactly two years since the Russian invasion in February 2022.Last weekend, Belga News Agency reporter Frisien Vervaeke covered European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s trip to Kyiv on behalf of the European Newsroom (enr). Other high-ranking officials such as Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also made their way to the Ukrainian capital.The visit came as Ukrainian forces are losing ground and key support from allies, such as the United States, has been in doubt. Among other things, von der Leyen met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal.â€œMy visit to Kyiv marks the second anniversary of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine. I am coming to celebrate the extraordinary resistance of the brave Ukrainian people,â€ von der Leyen told reporters travelling with her, among them the Belga News Agency reporter acting as a pool reporter for the enr, after arriving in Kyiv.â€œWe have recently made major announcements in terms of financial support to Ukraine, but it is  also very important to express our moral support. And of course, this trip will be the opportunity to discuss all aspects of our European support to Ukraine,â€ the European Commission president added.This was the third pool trip for the European Newsroom. This time, text and photo material was shared with the pool.Ahead of the trip, the enr published a Key Story on the two-year anniversary of Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, which you can read here.https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1761265905420452082",1
Furious farmers paralyse Brussels in protest at EU agricultural rules,"Convoys of farmers protesting against agricultural regulations and food imports occupied the EU quarter in Brussels on Monday, blocking roads and setting fires. Following proposals from the European Commission, EU agriculture ministers vowed to cut red tape â€“ but called for more ambitious proposals to better meet farmersâ€™ demands.Hundreds of tractors thronged streets around the EUâ€™s headquarters in Brussels on Monday as EU ministers met to seek ways to streamline farming rules and red tape fueling protests around the bloc.An estimated 900 tractors brought the cityâ€™s European quarter to a halt for the second time in a month. The farmers lit fireworks, burned tyres, hurled eggs and sprayed manure on police, who fired water cannons and tear gas in response.Farmers say theyâ€™re angry about burdensome regulations and cheap imports, particularly from Ukraine. Falling incomes from agricultural produce are also a major source of anger. As another example, they cite free trade agreements, such as with the South American trade bloc Mercosur. Agreements like that allow low-quality food to enter Europe at dumping prices, they said, causing European farmers to fear unfair competition.Despite the recent protests against EU agricultural rules, the European Parliament on Tuesday voted in favour of the controversial Nature Restoration Law, which aims to rehabilitate biodiversity and degraded ecosystems – but could put additional pressure on the agricultural sector.While farmersâ€™ protests are common in Brussels, this Mondayâ€™s demonstrations are the most extreme the city has seen since the anti-establishment â€œyellow jacketsâ€ marches in 2018.Elsewhere in Europe, farmers have been taking to the streets, too. In Spain for example,  thousands of farmers rallied outside the agriculture ministry in Madrid, holding placards including one that read: â€œThe countryside is in the abyss and the government doesnâ€™t care.â€Furthermore, Polish farmers blocked a major highway into Germany on Monday, carrying their protest against EU regulations and â€œuncontrolledâ€ Ukrainian grain imports into its second day. Polish farmers also blocked a border crossing with Slovakia, setting up barriers in the village of Barwinek and not allowing any vehicles to pass for the first hour.Thousands of Polish farmers also gathered in Warsaw on Tuesday to protest against the European Green Deal and in favour of stricter controls on imports of agri-food products from Ukraine.EU ministers meet to pacify farmersâ€™ furyThe rolling protests – which saw French President Emmanuel Macron angrily heckled over the weekend – have unnerved EU leaders concerned they could prove a boon for the far-right at European elections in June. On Saturday, Macron attended the annual Paris International Agricultural Show, one of the worldâ€™s largest and most important agricultural shows, where protesters clashed with police.Agriculture ministers from the 27-nation bloc were in Brussels on Monday to examine proposals from the European Commission for simplifying the EUâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in a new attempt to try to assuage farmers.CAP refers to the EUâ€™s flagship agricultural subsidy policy. To receive support from the CAP, farmers and ranchers must meet a series of environmentally friendly conditions.The European Commission has presented a raft of options to reduce the bureaucratic burden on farmers to access subsidies, among other things, offering more flexibility around land use and farming inspections. The proposals would also relax some environmental constraints for farmers, including easing demands for former livestock farmers to convert their land into grassland. The Commission envisions simplifying administration and changing the way on-site inspections work in a bid to cut the number of visits farmers face by 50 percent. Added leeway could also be granted to farmers who fail to meet the CAP requirements because of extreme weather events.European Commissioner for Agriculture Janusz Wojciechowski opened the door to revisit the current CAP regulations, which are in force between 2023 and 2027. He wants to review the environmentally friendly conditions that must be implemented in the farming sector to obtain the support of the CAP. On February 6, the Commission also withdrew from a controversial proposal for a law to cut pesticide use.However, EU agriculture ministers asked the European Commission to â€œquicklyâ€ present â€œmore ambitiousâ€ measures to respond to farmersâ€™ protests, since the Member States consider those proposed â€œnot sufficientâ€.A step forward, but not enoughThe non-governmental organisation World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) warned that farmersâ€™ concerns are not being addressed by these measures. â€œThe European Commission is running around like a headless chicken throwing environmental measures under the tractor.â€Anu Suono, agriculture policy expert at WWFâ€œThese measures will be a very first step towards answering peopleâ€™s concerns, but it is not enough,â€ Belgiumâ€™s Agriculture Minister David Clarinval, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, told reporters after the meeting in Brussels.â€œThe new CAP was badly written, the current exemptions are insufficient, we need substantial changes,â€ Francesco Lollobrigida, Minister for Agriculture in Italy, said, demanding a simplification of the rules for the sector.Their Spanish equivalent, Luis Planas, said that a new European pact is needed for farmers and rural areas. He called on the Commission to urgently present legislative proposals to change some of the conditions that farmers must meet to receive support from the CAP. ThoseÂ  modifications should be adopted before the elections to the European Parliament in June, according to Planas.Slovenia welcomed the Commissionâ€™s proposals for less red tape for farmers but would like to see more flexibility in the conditions for payments, Agriculture Ministry State Secretary Eva Knez said ahead of Mondayâ€™s ministerial meeting. Knez singled out a proposal to exempt smaller farms from the Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) checks that farmers must meet in order to receive direct payments.On February 20, the Bulgarian Agriculture and Food Ministry sent a notification to the European Commission that it will apply for a derogation for 2024 concerning the minimum share of agricultural land dedicated to non-productive areas.The derogation gives farmers greater flexibility in terms of areas, placing fewer restrictions on how farmers can use them, so that revenue losses are reduced, while the corresponding environmental benefits are ensured. The Croatian government is trying to secure additional budget support for farmers and, through its proposals at the Council of the EU, certain measures and flexibility within available European agricultural funds, said Agriculture Minister Marija VuÄkoviÄ‡. She noted that her ministry was preparing proposals for reducing the paperwork farmers are expected to do.Sweden: building trust is keySweden is one of the few countries where there hasnâ€™t been much protest from farmers. One of the reasons, according to Palle BorgstrÃ¶m, head of the major Swedish farming association Lantbrukarnas RiksfÃ¶rbund (LRF), is a â€œmore constructive discussion and relationâ€ between the farmers and the government.â€œIn Sweden, we have chosen to build trust between farmers and the rest of the society. Protests would be devastating and destroy this trust,â€ BorgstrÃ¶m recently told Swedish Television SVT in an interview.According to him, Swedish farmers have also been more successful in getting compensation from the market, compared to further south in Europe, where their colleagues are facing a tougher situation with discount chains â€œthat always are putting the prices downâ€.Most major political parties in Sweden are also very pro-trade, strongly supporting agreements with Mercosur countries, New Zealand and Australia.This article is published weekly.

Needing to see things on paper: Interview with Green lead candidate Terry Reintke,"On February 28, the European Newsroom spoke to Terry Reintke, the Green lead candidate for the European elections in June, on the sidelines of the European Parliament plenary session in Strasbourg, France.Correspondents of participating enr agencies questioned Terry Reintke who is an MEP and vice-president of the Greens/EFA Group on her priorities for the elections, the Green Deal, farmersâ€™ protests and the looming spectre of right-wing extremism.The Greensâ€™ lead candidate is demanding written commitments from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in order to support her re-election. â€œI will need to see things on paper before I vote in a certain way,â€ she said in an interview with the European Newsroom in Strasbourg on Wednesday. Von der Leyen, aiming for a second term as President of the European Commission after the European elections in the summer, will need a majority in the European Parliament after the election. She could be dependent on the votes of the Greens.Reintke further said that the EUâ€™s environmental and climate policy must be continued and expanded. Investments in infrastructure, renovation and the green transformation of companies are needed. â€œThis will be key for us, alongside obviously with making the transition socially just,â€ she said.On the subject of the ongoing farmersâ€™ protests across Europe, the Green leader said that theyÂ  require â€œthat we listen to them and try to find answersâ€, the Green leader said. But there was one important restriction: their problems are not the result of the Green Deal.Several enr agencies, including AFP, AGERPRES, dpa, EFE and TT attended the interview in person in the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Leading Green candidate Reintke: von der Leyen should give written assurances,"Terry Reintke, the leading Green candidate for the European election, spoke to the European Newsroom (enr) on her priorities for the elections, the Green Deal, farmersâ€™ protests and the looming spectre of right-wing extremism.The Greensâ€™ lead candidate for the European elections, Terry Reintke, is demanding written commitments from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in order to support her re-election. â€œI will need to see things on paper before I vote in a certain way,â€ she said in an interview with the European Newsroom in Strasbourg on Wednesday. She said she believes that von der Leyen is currently feeling pressure, especially from her own party family, the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP). This is very tangible and already having a major impact, Reintke said.Von der Leyen is aiming for a second term as President of the European Commission after the European elections in the summer. To achieve this, she will also need a majority in the European Parliament after the election. She could be dependent on the votes of the Greens.Reintke said that the EUâ€™s environmental and climate policy must be continued and expanded. Investments in infrastructure, renovation and the green transformation of companies are needed. â€œThis will be key for us, alongside obviously with making the transition socially just,â€ she said.European elections: a rise of the far-right?Reintke refused to put a prognosis on what she sees as a success in Juneâ€™s European Parliament elections, saying she aimed at â€œconsolidating the strong result we had in 2019 with the addition of having a more geographically diverse groupâ€. This will involve, she said, achieving good results outside the countries of central Europe and seeking partners in the South and East, traditionally not very fertile ground for Green parties.Although in countries such as Spain the expected rise of Spainâ€™s leftist Sumar party will help Green parties in this strategy, at the European level the polls predict a sharp drop in seats for Green parties throughout the EU, which would leave them as the sixth-largest force in the European Parliament.To try to fight this trend across Europe, the Greens will campaign against the return of austerity and for investment in green and social infrastructure. It is part, Reintke said, of a broader strategy to curb the far-right that also includes warning centre and right-wing parties about the dangers of not maintaining cordons sanitaires.In the Green candidateâ€™s opinion, a future coalition between the EPP and for example the European Conservatives and Reformists group (ECR) – who could become the third force in the Chamber – would mean a â€œvery clear danger that achievements of this legislature could be reversed or at least could be on hold and not move forwardâ€ on climate issues.â€œI think there is certainly a threat that the far-right is going to grow in these European elections,â€ Reintke said. She added however that the shift to the right is not a fatal automatism and warned to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy.Farmersâ€™ protestsFarmers protested in the European quarter of Brussels, coinciding with the meeting of European agriculture ministers. Rue de la Loi, Brussels, 26 February. EFE/Paula Garcia-AjofrÃ­nThe farmersâ€™ protests across Europe, which have been ongoing for more than a month, require â€œthat we listen to them and try to find answersâ€, the Green leader said. But there was one important restriction: their problems are not the result of the Green Deal.â€œThe Greens say that the European Commission has had to close a third of Europeâ€™s farms over the last 15 years, long before the Green Pact began to be talked about in mass politics. You have to see what the problem is with European agricultural policy,â€ Reintke warned.The Greens suggest changes in how farm subsidies are distributed in the EU to avoid â€œ80 percent of subsidies going to 20 percent of farmersâ€, and to tackle the â€œimpossible systemâ€ whereby large distributors and supermarket chains set prices while farmers are forced to produce at those prices in order not to go out of business.â€œWe have to look at how we change these structures so that farmers can make a sustainable living (...) and also measures to protect biodiversity and the climate. All this is possible, but we have to change agricultural policy at European level,â€ she said. â€œThe aim is to lift the pressure from the farmers to either grow or to close down.â€Reintke said that the farmersâ€™ movement is a movement containing very different groups with â€œsome farmers radicalised, some even undermined by the far-rightâ€. However, she pointed out that there are problems the EU needs to address such as economic problems and the competition system.Â Â This article is published weekly.

Poland en route to restore the rule of law and access to EU funds,"Throughout the Law and Justice partyâ€™s reign, Poland saw jurisdictional changes which triggered the European Union to turn off the money tap. With Donald Tusk in power, reforms are underway â€“ and the EU is unfreezing funds, thus greenlighting access to billions.Â On February 29, the European Commission formally approved the release of 137 billion Euro of European Union funds, giving the green light to the first payment of 6.3 billion Euro in the framework of the Recovery Plan. EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen had announced the release of funds while on a visit to Poland a week prior. However, this announcement does not mean Poland automatically receives the entire sum of 137 billion Euro. As the frozen funds stem from different â€œpotsâ€, a hand out will not happen in one go but over the course of the next three years until 2027 – and there are procedures to be followed. â€œToday we turn a page on the Rule Of Law issues [with Poland] as we recognise the important strides made by the government,â€ said EU Commissioner for Values and Transparency, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ on X.Funds had been withheld from Poland due to rule of law concerns, accusations of undermining the independence of judges and allowing the justice system to be influenced by party interests. Following the Polish general elections in October 2023, the new pro-EU government under former EU Council chief Donald Tusk has taken steps to undo the changes brought by the then-incumbent nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government. Tusk intends to comply with EU standards and restore Polandâ€™s access to the EU budget.What happened? The history of the dispute between the previous Polish PiS government and the European Commission dates back to 2015, when the Law and Justice party came into power. In the eyes of the commission, court reforms brought by the PiS party compromised judicial independence and were not in line with the rule of law of the European Union of which Poland has been a member since 2004.This led the EU to freeze a part of the cohesion funds and the whole Recovery and Resilience fund, as well as to the start of the Article 7 procedure against Poland by the EU in 2017. The procedure refers to serious breaches of EU values, enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union, and is seen as a last resort procedure. It is used in case of threats to the rule of law and can strip the affected country of certain rights, such as voting rights within the Council. In 2022, the commission cut off funding to Poland based on the PiS partyâ€™s court reforms. Since the Polish elections in autumn last year, which ended the PiSâ€™ eight-year-stint in power, the new government aims to restore the rule of law, close the Article 7 procedure and unfreeze EU funds through reforms.Polandâ€™s reforms: â€œa realistic planâ€ with lots of work left to do On February 20, the new Polish Minister of Justice, Adam Bodnar, laid out the new governmentâ€™s judicial reform plan to member statesâ€™ European affairs ministers in Brussels, accompanied by Polish Europe minister Adam SzÅ‚apka.The plan, which had been well received in Brussels, consists of a number of legislative changes aimed at reversing the reforms of the judiciary in Poland implemented by the PiS government.Bodnarâ€™s plan included nine legislative changes, the first of which is an amendment to the Act on the National Council of the Judiciary. The remaining changes concern the Constitutional Tribunal and the Supreme Court. The Polish government also plans to separate the office of the Minister of Justice from the office of the Prosecutor General and to adopt an act on the status of employees of courts and prosecutorâ€™s offices.However, parts of that plan depend on new legislation, which could yet be vetoed by Polish president Andrzej Duda, who is close to the PiS party that controlled the previous government.But senior EU officials said the decision to unlock Polish funding was based on the commissionâ€™s assessment that Poland had achieved important â€œsuper milestonesâ€. The decision does not mean judicial independence has been fully restored, they said.The European Commissioner for Justice, Didier Reynders, said the Polish governmentâ€™s commitments to reform were so far â€˜very impressiveâ€™. Commissioner VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, in charge of topics surrounding democracy, disinformation and rule of law, explained that Bodnar had presented â€œa realistic plan of action to restore the independence of the judiciaryâ€. According to her, that plan represented â€œa first stepâ€ toward the closure of the Article 7 procedure.However, she also admitted that â€œthere is a lot of work to be doneâ€, given the â€œextensive list of violationsâ€ of the rule of law. â€œAll these issues need to be resolved,â€ she added, ensuring a â€œconstructiveâ€ approach by the Commission in its dialogue with the national authorities.â€œWhen there is a will, there is a way,â€ commented the Belgian Foreign Minister, Hadja Lahbib, on behalf of the EU Council presidency. Lahbib emphasised the â€˜determinationâ€™ shown by the recently installed government of Donald Tusk to â€œreverse the trendâ€ in Poland in recent years. â€œWe welcome this positive dynamic,â€ the minister said, hoping for the closure of the Article 7 procedure by the end of the Belgian presidency on June 30.How much and when? The money – totalling at 137 billion Euro – comes from a development budget controlled by the European Commission (76.5 billion Euro) and from a post-Covid-19 recovery plan (59.8 billion Euro).The sum can be broken down in both overdue payments that were blocked and payments due in the next few years, which would also have been blocked had the commission not decided to restore Polandâ€™s funding.The Recovery and Resilience FundAlmost 60 billion Euro stem from the post-pandemic Recovery Fund of which 25.3 billion Euro are grants and 34.5 billion Euro are loans. Poland had earlier submitted a National Recovery Plan specifying how the money would be used, for example in the area of climate and environmental policies or the field of digitalisation and cybersecurity.The money of the recovery fund still needs to be approved by EU member states. In general, all payments from this budget have to be approved by a sufficient majority of member states represented in the Council of the EU, following a recommendation by the commission. This applies not just to Poland, but to any EU country seeking support from the recovery fund. On February 29, the commission recommended that the council should approve Polandâ€™s latest payment request.â€œOnce confirmed by Member States, todayâ€™s EU Commission assessment paves the way for the disbursement of the first tranche of â‚¬6.3 billion out of the total allocation of â‚¬59.8 billion in RRF [Recovery and Resilience Fund] funds to Poland,â€ Vera JourovÃ¡ said on X. Poland expects to receive the first tranche in April. https://twitter.com/VeraJourova/status/1763168587135463715The development budgetThe other 76.5 billion Euro will be paid out according to an investment plan agreed on between the commission and the Polish government for the 2021-2027 period. The plan falls under the EUâ€™s cohesion policy, which funds development in the EUâ€™s less-wealthy member states. Payments from this budget are controlled by the commission and do not require council approval.The payments are also not immediately disbursed but are reimbursements which are transferred once member states have implemented designated projects. Brussels expects Poland to request the return of around 600 million Euro in the coming weeks, according to commission sources.This article is published weekly.

Abortion rights: France leads the way with landmark constitutional change,"In a pioneering move just in time for International Womenâ€™s Day on March 8, French lawmakers have voted to enshrine abortion rights in the countryâ€™s constitution. At the same time, politicians and experts warn that abortion rights are under pressure around the world. In Europe, abortion rights vary from country to country, with some more restrictive than others.The French parliament on Monday voted to anchor the right to abortion in the constitution, making France the first country in the world to offer explicit protection for terminating a pregnancy in its basic law. Abortions up to the 10th week of pregnancy have been allowed in France since 1975. Since then, the law has changed to allow women to have abortions up to the 14th week of pregnancy, and the costs of the procedure are covered by health insurance.President Emmanuel Macron described the move as â€œFrench prideâ€ that had sent a â€œuniversal messageâ€, and a special public ceremony is held to celebrate the move in Paris on International Womenâ€™s Day on March 8.France also intends to â€œtake this fight to the European levelâ€, said government spokeswoman Prisca Thevenot on Wednesday. â€œIn 2022, the President of the Republic announced his intention to include the right to abortion in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Unionâ€, the government spokeswoman said.French lawmakersâ€™ decision came as EU member countries and lawmakers reached an agreement in February on the blocâ€™s rules to tackle violence against women. The World Health Organization (WHO) on Monday hailed the vote by French legislators. â€œWe welcome Franceâ€™s decision to secure womenâ€™s rights and save their lives,â€ WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X.Following the French parliamentâ€™s vote, however, the Vatican repeated its opposition to abortion. â€œThe Pontifical Academy for Life recalls that in the era of universal human rights, there can be no â€˜rightâ€™ to take a human life,â€ the Vatican institution said in a statement, echoing concerns already raised by French Catholic bishops.Reproductive rights under threatMacron pledged last year to protect abortion in the constitution after the US Supreme Court in 2022 overturned the half a century old right to the procedure, allowing individual American states to ban or curtail it.At the time, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said he was â€œreally troubled by the decision of the US Supreme Court. It is a major step back in the fights for womenâ€™s rights,â€ in a post on X (then Twitter).https://twitter.com/PrimeministerGR/status/1540639019737939970?s=20French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal said the right to abort remained â€œin dangerâ€ worldwide, with our â€œfreedoms in essence threatened... at the mercy of decision makersâ€.Conservative counter-campaigns are unravelling global advances in womenâ€™s rights, the latest â€œbacklashâ€ in a series dating to the 1980s, activists and experts warned ahead of International Womenâ€™s Day. Observers say advances in womenâ€™s rights have been systematically followed by a backlash ever since the 1980s.The â€œbacklashâ€ theory was detailed by American feminist Susan Faludi in her 1991 book: â€œBacklash: The Undeclared War Against American Womenâ€. It describes US conservative movementsâ€™ strategy following the liberalisation of abortion laws and the first entry of women into the labour market in the 1970s.Violence against women on the riseOrganised and politicised, the counter-movement unpicks abortion rights, fuels online hate and harassment and also encourages domestic violence, researchers say.The EU agreed on its first-ever law to combat violence against women in February. The law seeks to protect women in the 27-nation European Union from gender-based violence, forced marriages, female genital mutilation and online harassment. The European Commission first proposed the major legislation on March 8, 2022, to mark International Womenâ€™s Day.However, the agreement failed to include a common definition of rape. Access to abortion should be available for rape victims, however a number of states worldwide restrict abortion even for cases of rape and incest. States in opposition of defining rape in the text argued that rape does not have the cross-border dimension necessary for it to be considered a crime that comes with common penalties in the bloc, thus questioning the EUâ€™s competence in the matter.At the end of February, the 8th of March Institute, a Slovenian NGO, launched a campaign for safe and accessible abortion across Europe. The campaign, called â€˜My Voice, My Choiceâ€™, aims to collect one million signatures across the EU, and it brings together organisations from Spain, France, Poland, Finland and Ireland. The organisers have identified the issue as important ahead of the upcoming European elections and due to the rise of extremism in Europe. As in other countries, Slovenia is facing increased levels of violence against women and gender stereotyping in many areas.Abortion rights across EuropeWhile abortion rights are increasingly under threat, European countries do have rules that allow the early termination of pregnancy – some, however, stricter than others. A selection of several countries shows their differences.Albania: In Albania, abortion was allowed by law in the early 1990s, and the figures speak of a significant decrease in cases. Womenâ€™s advocacy groups and public health specialists, however, have concerns about so-called sex-selective abortion. By even the most modest estimates Albania is â€œmissingâ€ thousands of girls, following years of sex-selective abortions that led to the termination of pregnancies by families hoping for male children. Despite a rise in awareness, deep-seated values seem hard to overturn – and experts warn that it could lead to social imbalance.Bulgaria: Abortion on request in Bulgaria was legalised in 1956. In 1968, the government prohibited childless women from getting an abortion out of fear of depopulation. Other restrictions were also introduced throughout the years, but after the end of the communist regime in the country, abortion on request during the first trimester of pregnancy was allowed once again. Currently, a woman can choose to have an abortion by the end of the 12th week of pregnancy.Czech Republic: The Czech Republic has had a law permitting abortion since 1957. In case of termination of pregnancy at the request of the mother, the latest date is the 12th week of pregnancy, and in case of genetic defects, the 24th week. Lawmakersâ€™ proposals to restrict abortions have not been successful. A crushing majority of Czechs are in favour of freedom of decision-making on abortion, a 2023 survey conducted by the Public Opinion Research Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences (CVVM) showed.Germany: Abortion is not fully legalised in Germany, but it remains unpunishable in the first twelve weeks if the woman receives counselling beforehand. However, the social-democratic SPD, the Greens and the liberal FDP parties in the German government are considering deleting article 218 from the penal code, in which it is currently included.Italy: A law enacted in 1978 on the voluntary interruption of pregnancy has often been the focus of bitter controversies and harsh attacks in Italy. The law states that it is possible to have an abortion in a public health facility within the first 90 days of pregnancy only in particular 'â€circumstances in which the continuation of pregnancy, childbirth or maternity would pose a serious danger to the womanâ€™s physical or mental healthâ€. The law also allows conscientious objection by doctors and nurses, making it harder to access abortion, of which Italy officially has one of the lowest rates in the world.Poland: Abortion is currently permitted in Poland only if the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or if it threatens the health or life of the mother. Polandâ€™s newly-formed coalition government wants to reverse a 2020 constitutional court ruling which demolished a decades-long abortion compromise, influenced by judges appointed by the then ruling socially-conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, which led to a near-total ban on terminations. Portugal: Abortion laws in Portugal were liberalised on April 10, 2007, allowing an elective abortion to be provided at a womanâ€™s request until the 10th week of pregnancy. Recently, the question of a new referendum on the right to abortion in Portuguese law has been raised during the political campaign by a candidate from AlianÃ§a DemocrÃ¡tica (a coalition of three conservative parties) for the next legislative election taking place on March 10, but the subject has not been included by any of the political parties or coalitions running for parliament.Romania: In Romania, abortion on demand is regulated by law (Penal Code) and can be performed up to the 14th week of pregnancy. Past this interval, the medical act is punishable by imprisonment or a fine and a ban on exercising certain rights, with some exceptions. For non-surgical abortion (with pills), the recommendations in the medical guidelines, corroborated with those in the pharmaceutical leaflets, provide for a limit of nine weeks. After more than nine weeks of pregnancy, this method is no longer used by doctors.Slovenia: Slovenia is one of the few countries that have a constitutional right to freedom of parents to decide on the births of their children. As a result, abortion is legal and allowed in Slovenia, and the number of abortions is very low. However, the issue of abortion is frequently raised as a topic in political and civil society debates, particularly in the context of a perceived strengthening of more conservative views and initiatives on this issue.Spain: In Spain, voluntary termination of pregnancy has been governed since 2010 by a law passed during the socialist government of JosÃ© Luis RodrÃ­guez Zapatero. The law was endorsed in 2023 by the Constitutional Court, which enshrined the right of women to decide â€œautonomously and without coercionâ€ whether or not to continue with the pregnancy, a right enforceable by the public administration. It allows for a voluntary termination within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy. The law also recognises the possibility of interrupting a pregnancy until the 22nd week if there is â€œserious riskâ€ of foetal pathology or when the motherâ€™s life is in danger.Sweden: In Sweden, the government is investigating at the moment how to modernise the abortion law of 1975 to make it easier for women to do the abortions at home, in a safe manner. Most abortions are already only started in a clinic or hospital, with drugs given to the patients, but then finalised at home. Abortions have been legal in Sweden since 1938, with current laws allowing them up to  the 18th week.This article is published weekly.

"Criticism, controversy and cooperation: What's new with EU border agency Frontex?","Frontex, the EUâ€™s border security agency has repeatedly come under fire, accused of supporting illegal pushbacks and using excessive force against migrants. The 2023 Adriana boat tragedy off the Greek coast prompted an investigation by EU ombudsman Emily Oâ€™Reilly who presented findings â€“ and criticisms â€“ in late February.In June 2023, EU ombudsman Emily Oâ€™Reilly launched a probe into the European Border and Coast Guard Agency (Frontex) over the Adriana boat tragedy in which more than 600 people lost their lives off the coast of Greece.The overcrowded trawler – estimated to have carried more than 750 people bound for Europe – sank; only 104 survivors were rescued and just 82 bodies were recovered. Conflicting accounts by survivors and the Greek coastguard emerged as to how the incident unfolded and whether deaths could have been avoided.The seven-month probe by Oâ€™Reillyâ€™s office found that Frontex is unable to fully uphold EU rights obligations when carrying out sea rescues under current rules. â€œIf Frontex has a duty to help save lives at sea, but the tools for it are lacking, then this is clearly a matter for EU legislators,â€ Oâ€™Reilly said as she presented her report on February 28. â€œFrontex includes â€˜coast guardâ€™ in its name but its current mandate and mission clearly fall short of that,â€ O'Reilly said. She warned that, unless the rules changed, it is likely â€œthere will be a repeat of the Adriana tragedyâ€, one of the worst to happen in European waters. The ombudsmanâ€™s office has no power to enforce recommendations from its inquiries, only to flag areas of concern.Highest death toll in 2023: Mediterranean Sea still the most lethal route for migrantsAccording to a statement by the UNâ€™s International Organization for Migration (IOM), 2023 has been the deadliest year for migrants since the IOM established their open-access database on migrant deaths and disappearances, the Missing Migrants Project, in 2014.At least 8,565 people died on migration routes worldwide in 2023, making it the year with the highest death toll since records began a decade ago, the United Nations said on March 6. Slightly more than half of the total migrant deaths in 2023 came as a result of drowning. The Mediterranean Sea continues to be the most lethal route for migrants with at least 3,129 deaths and disappearances registered last year. Â Whatâ€™s Frontexâ€™ job –  searching yes, rescuing no? Frontex, founded in 2004 and head-quartered in Warsaw, has long been accused of human rights violations, covering up or turning a blind eye to illegal pushbacks. In 2022, the then-director of Frontex, Fabrice Leggeri, resigned after serious accusations were made against him and his staff over the treatment of migrants trying to reach Europe.â€œThere is obvious tension between Frontexâ€™s fundamental rights obligations and its duty to support member states in border management control,â€ Oâ€™Reilly said.The European Commission said it had â€œtaken noteâ€ of the report. â€œWe will duly assess it and respond to it thoroughly,â€ said spokeswoman Anitta Hipper. She noted that, â€œwhen it comes to search and rescue, this is a matter of competence for the member statesâ€ – meaning that Frontex operates only as a support agency to national authorities in the EU countries where it operates.The current executive director of Frontex, Hans Leijtens, reminded Oâ€™Reilly that Frontex was not the European Unionâ€™s agency for search and rescue operations for migrants at sea, but the European security guard agency for borders and coasts.â€œWe are not the European Search and Rescue Agency. We are the European Border and Coast Guard Agency,â€ Leijtens declared, acknowledging that the â€œdifficultâ€ term in the name of the agency is â€œcoast guardâ€ since, as he explained, â€œin some countriesâ€ the coast guard is responsible for protecting borders, but also for carrying out search operations and rescue at sea.â€œThat is not our case,â€ he commented, saying that Frontexâ€™ mandate mentions search and rescue operations, but added that the agency does not have rescue among its tasks, although it does have search.""Our agency strictly adheres to its mandate, which does not include the coordination of rescue efforts – a responsibility that rests with national rescue coordination centres,"" Frontex said in a statement. ""In every instance where our assets detect potential distress situations, we promptly alert the relevant authorities.""According to Frontex, it will run 19 joint operations with 300 deployment locations in total in 2024. Concerns about Frontexâ€™ human rights track recordHuman rights organisations are expressing their worries regarding treatment of refugees and migrants, citing a lack of safe migration routes as well as problems faced in on-the-ground cooperation.At an event in Madrid on March 11, general director of the non-governmental organisation Spanish Commission for Refugees (CEAR), Estrella GalÃ¡n, expressed her concern about the â€œlack of proposals for legal and safe routes for migrantsâ€ in the European pact.European Commissioner for the Interior, Ylva Johansson, attending the same event, replied that the management of legal migration is largely a â€œnational competenceâ€, but she believed that the EU would be â€œstrongerâ€ if it designed a community approach to the matter. She further said that â€œa major reform of Frontexâ€ is unnecessary and she expressed being â€œquite satisfiedâ€ with its operation.Â At last weekâ€™s Justice and Home Affairs Council where ministers exchanged views on evaluation of Frontexâ€™ regulation, Johannson said â€œwe should not change the regulation, but we need to focus on the implementationâ€.A report by Belgian human rights group 11.11.11, the â€œcoalition for international solidarityâ€ consisting of 60 NGOs and movements, found that European countries turned away more migrants at their external borders in 2023 than the year before. According to figures from the organisation, 340,000 people were turned away last year without the chance to apply for asylum – the real numbers are possibly higher.According to 11.11.11, Frontex is in a weak position compared to member states that do not adhere to correct asylum policies. â€œIn Bulgaria, for example, we see Frontex staff being asked to leave so they cannot document. The role of monitoring and surveillance is not sufficiently recognised by member states, but also not widely enough recognised by Frontex itself. Frontex is needed, but needs to organise itself differently,â€ 11.11.11 director Els Hertogen told Flemish broadcaster VRT.Several people sit in a boat in the Mediterranean while rescue workers try to help them. The Mediterranean continues to be the most lethal migration route, according to the International Organization for Migration. Photo: Antonio Sempere/EUROPA PRESS/dpaDeals with EU accession candidates, externalising border management: â€œFortress Europeâ€?EU rules approved in December aim to share hosting responsibilities across the 27-country bloc – and to speed up deportations of irregular migrants deemed ineligible to stay. Rights groups including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch slammed the changes as a further shift towards â€œFortress Europeâ€.In Bulgaria, for example, Frontex deployment will soon triple. From March 20, there will be a further 500 to 600 Frontex officers, explained agency director Hans Leijtens on February 29 at the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint on Bulgariaâ€™s border with Turkey.Â Â Leijtens was joined by the countryâ€™s Interior Minister Kalin Stoyanov, who said they discussed, among other things, the possibilities for providing a larger number of Frontex officers to be deployed at the Bulgarian-Turkish and Bulgarian-Serbian borders.Since 2017, Bulgaria has been protecting the EUâ€™s external border with Turkey with a 234-kilometre metal fence financed by Brussels, featuring barbed wire and thermal imaging cameras. The country is to join the border-free Schengen area from the end of March, though only its air and sea borders are included as a decision is still pending on lifting checks at land borders.All countries on the Western Balkan migration route [Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia] were recording an increased number of illegal crossings of the border, as the route â€œis exceptionally activeâ€, according to Slovenian Interior Minister BoÅ¡tjan Poklukar. The increase was the reason for the Slovenian governmentâ€™s plan to establish two asylum centres at two former border crossings with Croatia for up to three years, he noted on the sidelines of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in early March in Brussels.Besides ramping up Frontex deployment in member states, border management is also externalised through collaboration with non-EU member states. Frontex has agreements with accession candidates Albania, Serbia, Montenegro, Moldova and North Macedonia. In October 2022, North Macedonia and the EU signed an agreement on operational cooperation in border management with Frontex. In April 2023, a joint operation at the countryâ€™s southern border with Greece was launched. More than 100 European border guards support local authorities with border surveillance and checks, including patrolling, checking documents and gathering information on cross-border crime.In November 2023, Albania and Italy struck a deal for two migrant reception centres on Albanian territory with an ability to process up to 36,000 migrants per year. The Italian-run centres are intended to process the asylum claims of migrants rescued by Italian authorities at sea.The first is a centre for the identification of migrants inland that will hold â€œa maximum of 3,000 personsâ€, and a smaller centre will be built at the port of ShÃ«ngjin, to allow Italian ships arriving with migrants on board to dock.Romeâ€™s deal with Tirana was a model of thinking outside the box to solve migration issues, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a letter to the EU member states ahead of the EU summit last December.However, the agreement raised concerns, among others, by the Council of Europe. ""The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Italy and Albania on disembarkation and the processing of asylum applications, concluded last week, raises several human rights concerns and adds to a worrying European trend towards the externalisation of asylum responsibilities,"" said Dunja MijatoviÄ‡, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights.Besides striking a deal with Italy, Albania in January also extended an agreement with the EU for Frontex operations from 2018. The agreement proposed by the EU provides that the Frontex officers exercise executive powers in the field of illegal migration and border crimes.Â Bosnia and Herzegovina started negotiations with Frontex on February 12, as one of the conditions set by the European Union for the opening of accession talks in March.But not only accession candidates are signing deals with Frontex: Former EU member Britain last week signed a deal with Frontex to crack down on the irregular arrival of migrants, as London tries to stop small boats with asylum-seekers crossing the Channel from France.This article is published weekly.

"EU unprepared for climate crisis, EEA risk report warns","The European Commission has unveiled a new strategy that shall boost the EUâ€™s ability to adapt to the adverse effects of climate change. The plan was announced a day after the European Environment Agency warned that EU member states are not doing enough to tackle the risks. The stakes are high, especially for southern Europe.
On Tuesday, the European Commission published its plan for managing risks exacerbated by climate change, such as floods and wildfires. The strategy aims to strengthen the blocâ€™s ability to adapt to the climate crisis and build resilience against the increased risk of climate-related problems such as â€œdroughts, floods, forest fires, diseases, crop failures or heatwavesâ€, a Commission press release said.Rather than mitigating climate change, the plan â€œis about the far-less talked about part of climate action, which is adaptationâ€, said EU climate commissioner Wopke Hoekstra. â€œWhat we are talking about here is building climate-resilient societies and economies,â€ he said at a press conference in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Hoekstra pointed to recent disasters in the EU – wildfires in Greece, flooding in Slovenia and a storm in Scandinavia – to underline the urgency. European Commission Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, said that â€œwe will be very much focusing on how to use our climate, diplomacy and outreach to all the countries in need of... help and assistance and technology-sharing... but also to the biggest polluters who could do moreâ€. Brussels calls on Member States to strengthen governance and coordination, better analyse the interconnections between different risks, adapt infrastructure planning and improve public and private financing. In general, it calls on them to develop proactive management of adaptation to the climate crisis.The Commissionâ€™s plan came after the first ever climate risk assessment by the European Environment Agency (EEA), published on Monday, which said the EU is inadequately prepared. The report warned of â€œcatastrophicâ€ consequences if Europe failed to take urgent action to adapt to risks posed by climate change.The EEA assessment called on EU member states to work together at a regional and local level to tackle climate change risks with precautionary measures. According to the EEA report, â€œEurope is the fastest-warming continent in the worldâ€.The south is on fireThe dangers include fires, water shortages and their effects on agricultural production, while low-lying coastal regions face threats of flooding, erosion and saltwater intrusion.Areas in southern Europe are most at risk, the EEA report said. â€œSome regions of Europe are hotspots for multiple climate risks. Southern Europe is particularly exposed to the risk of forest fires and the impacts of heat and water scarcity on agricultural production, outdoor work and human health,â€ it added.The report, which identifies 36 climate risks in the EU, states that â€œheat-related risks have already reached critical levels in southern Europeâ€, given the â€œmore frequent and more intenseâ€ high temperatures in this region. This includes countries such as Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. The high temperatures have already led to dangerous forest fires in Portugal. One of the most lethal events was the forest fire in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande in central Portugal in June 2017, which caused 64 deaths and around 200 people to be displaced. The fires entered several cities, towns and villages and ended up destroying dozens of houses and industries.Smoke and flames rise from burning trees in Asklipio village, on Rhodes Island, Greece.  Photo: Aristidis Vafeiadakis/ZUMA Press Wire/dpaThe EEA risk assessment said that while some regions face increased flooding, â€œsouthern Europe can expect considerable declines in overall rainfall and more severe droughtsâ€.Furthermore, â€œfood supply in the EU is increasingly exposed to climate risks, from agricultural production notably in Southern Europe, fisheries and aquaculture, to food processing and international supply chainsâ€. The report found that increased drought and rising heat not only endanger crop production in southern Europe but place central European countries at risk too.However, the assessment does not mean that northern Europe is spared the negative impact of climate change, as floods in Germany and forest fires in Sweden, for example, have shown in recent years.Water supplies: a source of conflict?The European Commissionâ€™s plans presented on Tuesday dedicated a section to water, â€œa vital resource that is already under pressure in many parts of Europe due to structural mismanagement, unsustainable land use, hydro-morphological changes and pollutionâ€.The Commission warned that there is a risk of â€œincreased competition over water resources across sectors and uses, including potential risk of conflicts within and among the member states over transboundary water resourcesâ€.In Bulgaria, for example, water resources are expected to decline as a result of climate change. This could exacerbate the risk of water scarcity in vulnerable areas and, in years with particularly adverse conditions, elsewhere, said Associate Professor Emil Gachev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciencesâ€™ Climate, Atmosphere and Water Research Institute, at a forum about Bulgariaâ€™s water resources, held in Sofia on Tuesday. The forum was organised by the Bulgarian climate science media platform Climateka on the occasion of World Water Day, which takes place on March 22.According to Gachev, one-third of the worldâ€™s population is experiencing water scarcity, water resources remain scarce and this problem will worsen due to the growing population. He specified that the water resources are decreasing due to poor water management and pollution. According to Dr. Valentin Simeonov, a researcher with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, the change in ocean circulation and in particular the slowing down or stopping of the Gulf Stream will lead to a serious reduction in rainfall in Bulgaria.Stormclouds gather over EUâ€™s Green DealThe EUâ€™s Green Deal – once a core mission in Brusselsâ€™ fight against the climate crisis – is also looking increasingly under threat in the blocâ€™s upcoming elections as resistance grows to its costs and consequences.Farmersâ€™ protests, consumer cost-of-living worries and some countriesâ€™ hesitation are already undercutting the ambitious plan to make the EU carbon-neutral by 2050. The climate crisis is becoming â€œa real identity politics issueâ€ caught up in the farmersâ€ protests, said Susi Dennison, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.A Belgian farmer on Wednesday sued French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies, demanding compensation for damage to his farm caused by climate change. â€œClimate change is having a tangible impact on my work and life: yield losses, extra work, and the stress that comes from dealing with a disrupted crop calendar,â€ farmer Hugues Falys said in a statement.Many of the Green Dealâ€™s laws have been adopted: an end to selling internal-combustion engine cars by 2035; a border carbon tax; rules against importing goods from deforested zones. But momentum stalled last year with legislation to reduce chemical pesticides and to restore wilderness ecosystems – opposed on grounds they could undermine food production in the bloc.The European Environment Agencyâ€™s document should serve to guide the necessary actions necessary to mitigate the negative consequences of climate change. The European Commissionâ€™s plans on climate resilience were the last major climate and Green Deal initiatives before the June elections.Fact check: False claims challenge the existence of climate changeThe European Unionâ€™s Earth observation programme Copernicus recently recorded the warmest January on record, with an average temperature of 13 degrees Celsius. False claims on social networks argued that there was no climate change because temperatures of up to 15 degrees had been recorded in Germany as far back as January 1974.The fact checking team of the German Press Agency (dpa) debunked these claims, saying that to make a statement about the climate, it is not enough to look at the weather on individual days – you have to look at the weather over a longer period of time.Read the full fact check here: https://dpa-factchecking.com/germany/240214-99-987537/ This article is published weekly.

Fighting the right with social policies: Interview with European Left lead candidate Walter Baier,"On Monday, March 18, the European Newsroom sat down with European Left Spitzenkandidat Walter Baier for an exclusive interview leading up to the European Elections in June.â€œFirst of all, I want to say fighting the far-right is a moral and a cultural obligation. And there can be no compromises with the agenda of hatred, of antisemitism, of scapegoating the migrants. In this regard, we feel in line with many forces in the European spectrum of politics,â€ said Walter Baier.The 70-year-old Austrian was nominated last month by the Party of the European Left (PEL) as its candidate to head the next European Commission. Baier has been PEL president since December 2022 and helped found the â€œtransform!europeâ€ network of alternative thinking and political dialogue.The Party of the European Left is the larger of two leftist formations in the European Parliament – along with Now the People. Both are part of the 37-strong group of lawmakers called The Left in the EU parliament – where polls point to a surge by far-right movements in the upcoming elections across the 27-nation bloc in June.Â Photos: European Left (left), European NewroomAccording to the Austrian politician, fighting the European far-right requires strong social politics, respect for the social interests of employees, liberation of young people from the danger of insecurity and guaranteeing access to decent housing.Climate change must also not be forgotten in the fight for social justice. â€œEcological reorganisation must go hand in hand with the reduction of social inequalities,â€ Baier said.With these priorities for his campaign, Baier rules out for the time being that the current President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will gain the support of the Left group in the European Parliament because â€œshe is not the right personâ€ to implement them.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbFAJeYkIEgVideo: FENA.

"How does disinformation work? Targeting existing problems, experts say","Disinformation campaigns come in all shapes and sizes. For example, how are the current pro-Russian disinformation campaigns affecting the public and occupying journalists on a daily basis?From images of fake anti-Ukraine billboards to posts showing false graffiti against Ukraine's leader, pro-Russian disinformation online is targeting Western backing after two years of war.AFP's fact-checkers have debunked false content that is intended to support or encourage the idea of a growing public fatigue in Europe and the United States. Dpaâ€™s fact-checkers debunked that a study allegedly proves that the war in Ukraine is much more harmful to the climate than Germany's CO2 emissions. Pro-Russian disinformation is most effective when it builds on existing and divisive issues like immigration and purchasing power, experts say. ""The most successful narratives are the ones that tap into something that's already an issue, it's much harder to build from scratch,"" said  Elina Treyger, Senior Political Scientist at RAND Corporation, a nonprofit institution that helps improve policy and decision making through research and analysis. ""By multiplying the content so much, you'll inevitably hit your target"", agreed Jakub KalenskÃ½, Deputy Director of the European Centre of Excellence for Combating Hybrid Threats (Hybrid CoE). When the war in Ukraine began, for example, the Middle East and Africa were targeted with tailor-made narratives based on anti-American, anti-Western and colonial sentiments, explained Associate Professor Christine Dugoin-ClÃ©ment from the Sorbonne Business School in Paris (IAE Paris).Another tactic is to divert journalists with information overload. One campaign, the so-called ""Operation Matryoshka"", has aimed to keep journalists busy by spreading anti-Ukraine fake news and then challenging Western media to verify it.Another extensive operation, the ""DoppelgÃ¤nger"" operation, which was attributed to Russia by French intelligence, uses visuals that mimic Western media.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Disinformation in Europe.

Journalism key to fighting disinformation,"With the 2024 EU elections just months away, widespread disinformation campaigns on key EU policies are on the rise. Politicians and media experts alike warn that quality journalism and fact-checking are essential to prevent disinformation from spreading.Jerneja Jug JerÅ¡e, Head of the European Commission Representation in Slovenia warned in a panel discussion, co-organised by the Slovenian Press Agency (STA) in Ljubljana on February 2, that ""in the context of the upcoming European elections, we are seeing large disinformation campaigns focused on key EU policies"".She noted the Green Deal, aid to Ukraine and the joint migration policy as areas where disinformation is rife. The goal of spreading disinformation is to sow the seed of doubt and undermine trust in media, institutions and democracy, Jug JerÅ¡e said.Attendees of the panel discussion said that the goal of disinformation is to evoke unease and fear in society, giving the example of untrue statements on growing violence by immigrants in Ljubljana.One major issue in reporting on political campaigns is that the candidates have become aware of fact-checking and give vague statements without exact figures, said Alenka Marovt, editor of several fact-checking programs on Slovenian commercial television channel POP TV.AnuÅ¡ka DeliÄ‡, editor-in-chief at OÅ¡tro, an online portal focused on research journalism, said that ""fact-checking should be the work of journalists. By letting special teams do the work, we have already lost the fight"", she stressed. Although used more by the right-wing, disinformation is also used by the left, as OÅ¡tro`s archive shows, said DeliÄ‡.April 27, 2023, Brussels. European Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ speaks to journalists about the European Media Freedom Act in an interview organised by the European Newsroom.  Photo: Benoit Doppagne/BelgaOn February 23, Vice-President of the European Commission, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, told the Czech News Agency CTK that the aim of disinformation campaigns is to influence public opinion and thus affect society as a whole. However, she added, false or untrue news can be refuted by verification.On February 21, Renate Schroeder, Director at the European Federation of Journalists (EFJ), told the European Newsroom (enr) that the draft guidelines for the platforms on mitigation of risks, such as disinformation, recently published by the European Commission, only once mention the role of journalists and media services providers. They instead focus on cooperation with fact-checkers among others. â€œWe cannot leave the work against disinformation to guidelines for the platforms, journalists are fact-checkers by their profession and we have to enable them to do their work at national, regional and local level and we are far from that,â€ Schroeder said. While the adopted European Media Freedom Act is important as it protects journalists and their editorial independence, one increasing problem is the appearance of too many â€œnews desertsâ€ all over Europe. We need an awareness â€œto sustain journalism as a public good,â€ Schroeder said.Terry Reintke, Green MEP and the partyâ€™s lead candidate in the June EU elections, sees the key in the implementation of the Digital Services Act which should ensure on a European level â€œthat platforms do what they have to do in order to prevent disinformation from spreading or even, maybe interventions into the electoral result from actors like Russiaâ€. She added that â€œthe Commission has to make sure that the platforms take their responsibility thereâ€.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Disinformation in Europe.

Disinformation intensifies ahead of the EU elections,"Political analysts say Moscow might seek to exploit political tensions in Europe where far-right parties are on the rise ahead of the elections on June 6-9. How prepared is Europe?About five months ahead of the EU elections, the High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell Fontelles, called disinformation and foreign interference â€œone of the most significant threats of our timeâ€. â€œ2024 is a critical year to fight against FIMI [Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference] because we have a lot of elections,â€ Borrell said in a speech in Brussels on January 23, adding that half of the worldâ€™s population will be called to the ballots this year with a total of 60 elections. According to Borrell, â€œmanipulation and interference have become an industrial activityâ€ and he warned that Russia and others had already â€œbuilt an extensive infrastructure for lying, manipulating and destabilising.â€ He emphasised  that the war in Ukraine not only targets â€œus, but our partners in the Western Balkansâ€.About three weeks later, on February 13, the French government warned that disinformation attacks from countries like Russia were ""likely to intensify"" before European elections in June.According to the second FIMI report by the European External Action Service (EEAS), Ukraine is the country which is most targeted by disinformation. The survey analysed 750 incidents between December 2022 and November 2023. Russian disinformation on the rise ahead European electionsOn February 23, European Commission Vice-President VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡ told the Czech News Agency CTK that the biggest risks are in Central and Eastern European countries. ""As far as Russian influence is concerned, because it is dominant, we are in an information war with Russia that we did not start but unfortunately we have to respond to it,"" she said.""In every country we see different types of sore spots that can be attacked to make people believe misinformation or get into a certain vortex of panic or fear. Unfortunately, this is all exploitable in election campaigns and I think we should prevent it.""European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡The widespread use of pro-Russian disinformation has impacted elections in Europe, with fear mounting ahead of the European Parliament's June elections. ""There will be disinformation operations on Ukraine (and) on a whole host of current European issues to promote a conservative or nationalist agenda,"" said Valentin ChÃ¢telet, research associate for security at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab (DFRLab).From December 2023 onwards, a vast ""pro-Russian disinformation campaign"" in Germany created over 50,000 fake X-accounts (formerly Twitter) to stir up anger about the country's support for Ukraine, according to German weekly magazine Der Spiegel. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed it had ""eliminated"" around 60 fighters, mainly ""French mercenaries"", in a strike in northeastern Ukraine's Kharkiv in January.  In the wake of these accusations, several lists, including one claiming to reveal the identity of around 30 ""dead French mercenaries"", were broadcast by Telegram channels and pro-Kremlin activists. French volunteers in Ukraine denied the allegations, three of them directly to AFP. France, Germany and Poland to defend themselves against Russian disinformationThe Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Poland announced on February 12 that they wanted to work together to tackle disinformation efforts as they had fallen victim to the Russian destabilisation strategy.The three countries have agreed on a joint warning mechanism against Russian troll attacks, French Foreign Minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© said after the meeting with German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and his Polish colleague RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski.â€œRussia is trying to destroy European unity,â€ SÃ©journÃ© said after the tripartite meeting, adding that almost 200 fake news sites have been discovered. ""I call for the utmost vigilance,"" SÃ©journÃ© said in a direct address to the public, adding that such information attacks could increase in Europe over the next few weeks. ""In five months' time, our continent will vote in the European elections, and each of our countries will be a target for foreign powers"", SÃ©journÃ© said in a video posted on X (formerly Twitter) on February 13. https://twitter.com/steph_sejourne/status/1757404045046669349Kremlin propaganda network detected in FranceThe French Foreign Minister StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© said that Viginum, a French government agency, charged with defence against foreign online threats, had discovered a network of Russian websites designed to spread Kremlin propaganda in the West.Viginum said the ""structured and coordinated"" network was targeting Europe and the United States.Code-named ""Portal Kombat"", the network comprises 193 websites, Viginum reported after investigating between September and December of last year.The aim of the sites, ""most of which are dormant, is to spread fake news and views that serve Russia's interests"", SÃ©journÃ© said. ""They spread false information about Ukraine, divide public opinion and stir up hatred,"" he added.The Russian government has ramped up efforts to promote the Kremlin narrative since President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022.Political analysts knowledgeable about Russian disinformation narratives said Moscow might seek to exploit political tensions in Europe where far-right parties are on the rise ahead of the elections on June 6-9.In France, the right-wing National Rally (RN) is already the largest opposition party in France's National Assembly and leads President Emmanuel Macron's alliance by nearly ten percent in European election polls.A woman casts her vote at a polling station at a rural parish for parliamentary elections in Portugal. Photo: Cristian Leyva/ZUMA Press Wire/dpaFalse online political ads circulate in PortugalAnother example regarding the growing reach of online disinformation comes from Portugal, where researchers from ISCTE's (University Institute of Lisbon) MediaLab have detected, for the first time, â€œsigns of external interference in elections in Portugalâ€ with online adverts. One of them accused the PS (Socialist Party, S&D) of corruption.A check carried out by the ISCTE researchers, using Google's own screening tools, points to a company apparently based in the US state of Delaware, called Nekoplay LLC. According to public data from Google's Ads Transparency Centre, it is mainly dedicated to ads linked to the gaming industry.In total, the â€œâ€˜sponsored posts' may have reached more than two million Portuguese, around 22 percent of the population with electoral capacityâ€, says the MediaLab report, which was the result of a project, in partnership with the Portuguese news agency Lusa, about elections on social networks and the processes of disinformation in the pre-election phase for the legislative elections that took place on March 10.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Disinformation in Europe.

Traffic at German border disrupted as Polish farmers continue protest over EU rules,"On Monday, Polish farmers blocked two border crossings with Germany. Farmers across the EU have been testing EU agricultural policies for weeks.Berlin – Polish farmers continued to block two border crossings to Germany on Monday, leading to significant disruptions to cross-border traffic.The border crossings in Frankfurt Oder and Guben remain closed, a police spokeswoman said on Monday morning. Traffic was being rerouted, but that was leading to long traffic jams in Frankfurt, she added.Polish farmers, like many farmers across the European Union, have been protesting for weeks against EU agricultural policies. They are also complaining about cheap grain imports from neighbouring Ukraine, which they say create unfair competition.They started blocking the two crossings on the Polish-German border on Sunday and police expected them to end the action on Wednesday.

EU condemns 'so-called' Russian election in occupied Ukraine,"Following Russian President Vladimir Putin's election victory, the EU condemns the holding of Russian elections in the occupied territories of Ukraine.Brussels (dpa) - The European Union on Monday condemned Russia's holding of ""so-called 'elections'"" in occupied territories in Ukraine, following Moscow's announcement that Russian President Vladimir Putin had won a landslide victory.""The European Union strongly condemns the illegal holding of so-called 'elections' in the territories of Ukraine that Russia has temporarily occupied,"" the statement said, referring to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, annexed by Moscow in violation of international law back in 2014, as well as the mainland regions of Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhya and Kherson.""The European Union reiterates that it does not and will never recognise either the holding of these so-called 'elections' in the territories of Ukraine or their results,"" said the statement, issued by foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell on behalf of the EU.It said the elections ""are null and void and cannot produce any legal effect whatsoever.""The statement also said that ""the shocking death of opposition politician Alexei Navalny in the run up to the elections is yet another sign of the accelerating and systematic repression.""

"Time “to negotiate” end to war in Ukraine, fighting the right with social policies, says Left EU lead candidate Baier
","The European Left group wants to score points in the European election campaign with demands for affordable housing, free access to education, healthcare and public transport. Lead Candidate Walter Baier said in an exclusive interview with the European Newsroom that it was time to â€œnegotiateâ€ an end to Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine and explained the Leftâ€™s strategy to fight the far-right.â€œFirst of all, I want to say fighting the far-right is a moral and a cultural obligation. And there can be no compromises with the agenda of hatred, of antisemitism, of scapegoating the migrants. In this regard, we feel in line with many forces in the European spectrum of politics,â€ said Walter Baier.The 70-year-old Austrian was nominated last month by the Party of the European Left (PEL) as its candidate to head the next European Commission. Baier has been PEL president since December 2022 and helped found the â€œtransform!europeâ€ network of alternative thinking and political dialogue.The Party of the European Left is the larger of two leftist formations in the European Parliament – along with Now the People. Both are part of the 37-strong group of lawmakers called The Left in the EU parliament – where polls point to a surge by far-right movements in the upcoming elections across the 27-nation bloc in June. According to the Austrian politician, fighting the European far-right requires strong social politics, respect for the social interests of employees, liberation of young people from the danger of insecurity and guaranteeing access to decent housing.â€œWe drew up an electoral manifesto of which the specificity is that it is written from the perspective of the working class and young people,â€ said the former head of Austriaâ€™s communist party.â€It cannot be that large parts of our societies are worried about heating their homes during the winter or that they are afraid of the necessary ecological transformation,â€ Baier added.The main issues the far left plans to target ahead of the June European Parliament elections are therefore â€œthe social, economic and ecological interests of the European peopleâ€.Â According to Baier, it is essential to pay attention to the â€social interests of the working classesâ€ in order to combat the extreme right in Europe.Â Climate change must also not be forgotten in the fight for social justice. â€œEcological reorganisation must go hand in hand with the reduction of social inequalities,â€ Baier said.With these priorities for his campaign, Baier rules out for the time being that the current President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, will gain the support of the Left group in the European Parliament because â€œshe is not the right personâ€ to implement them.Von der Leyen is seeking a second term as president of the European Commission after the election in the summer, for which she also needs a majority in the European Parliament.Enshrining the right to decent and affordable housing, tackling Airbnb-type platformsâ€œIn our manifesto, we have several demands regarding the housing crisis, starting with enshrining the right to decent and affordable housingâ€ so that â€œadequate housing becomes a fundamental right in the primary law of the European Unionâ€, argues Baier, revealing that he will be travelling to around ten EU member states to campaign.According to the candidate, the measures also include imposing limits on rents and creating a European fund to help municipalities and cooperatives create housing.â€œWe would like the European Union to invest in the housing sector and we are in favour of strict and rigid regulation of [the activities of] Airbnb-type platforms,â€ he says.With regard to rents, the party proposes the creation of an EU directive â€œthat obliges member states to introduce legal limits on rents and to ban fixed-term tenancies and forced evictions from primary residencesâ€ and also the exemption of â€œpublic housing financing from the rules of the internal market and competitionâ€, so that countries can provide more aid to the sector.Time to â€œnegotiateâ€ in Russia-Ukraine war, backing Pope Francisâ€™ callThe head of the EUâ€™s main leftist political grouping has said it is time to â€œnegotiateâ€ an end to Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine, rallying behind a controversial call by Pope Francis for Kyiv to raise the â€œwhite flagâ€â€œI believe helping the Ukrainian people means now making attempts to end the war,â€ said Walter Baier. Baier underlined that his party – whose 26 full members include Germanyâ€™s Die Linke, Franceâ€™s Communists and Greeceâ€™s Syriza – had â€œabsolutely condemned the Russian aggressionâ€ in its manifesto for Juneâ€™s European elections. But in a joint interview with the European Newsroom on Monday, he said the conflictâ€™s â€œfrozenâ€ fronts required a new approach.â€œI would wish from the European Union... to take diplomatic efforts to start negotiations to achieve a ceasefire and to achieve the withdrawal of the Russian troops,â€ Baier said.â€œIn this regard, I fully support what Pope Francis was saying. Now itâ€™s the time to end the war, and now itâ€™s the time to negotiate and stop killing,â€ said the Austrian politician.In an interview broadcast earlier this month, the Argentine pontiff urged Kyiv, which has been fighting invading Russian forces for more than two years, to â€œraise the white flag and negotiateâ€.The Ukrainian government reacted with fury, even while the Vatican insisted the words â€œwhite flagâ€ were intended to mean a cessation of hostilities, not a surrender.Analysts see no immediate prospect of negotiations to find a breakthrough in the Ukraine war, with Russiaâ€™s Vladimir Putin emboldened by the erosion of Western support for Kyiv – while Ukraine is determined to keep fighting to recapture territory.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kbFAJeYkIEgVideo: FENA, Language: EnglishOn Western Balkans and EU EnlargementÂ When asked about the Austrian governmentâ€™s opposition to expanding the Schengen Area to include Romania and Bulgaria, Walter Baier found clear words.Â  â€œAllow me to answer now as an Austrian. I find the position of the Austrian government shameful. Itâ€™s unjust, itâ€™s unfair and itâ€™s ineffective,â€ Walter Baier said about his home countryâ€™s opposition to expanding the Schengen Area to include Romania and Bulgaria.Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer (Ã–VP, centre-right) has consistently maintained, including at the March 6-7 congress of the European Peopleâ€™s Party in Bucharest, that Vienna does not agree with the expansion of the Schengen Area as long as it is not functional in his governmentâ€™s opinion.According to a decision made at the end of 2023, Romania and Bulgaria will enter the Schengen Area from March 31 with air and sea borders. Bucharest authorities have stated that in 2024 they will continue the steps for Romaniaâ€™s full integration – also with land borders – into the European area of free movement.Earlier this month, the Belgian Presidency of the Council of the EU announced that it would continue to work for a full accession of Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area, in line with the recommendations of the European Commission.In the interview with the European Newsroom, Baier pointed out that the European Left can play a constructive role in fulfilling the criteria of the countries of the Western Balkans for joining the European Union.Baier recalled the Copenhagen criteria, which were set in 1993 as basic conditions for EU accession, emphasising the importance of respect for human rights and the rule of law. â€œI would also add respect for trade union rights and labour rights. I think that the European Left Party, which is in contact with left forces in different countries of the Western Balkans, can play a constructive role in creating these conditions, which are laid down in the Copenhagen criteria,â€ Baier pointed out.This article is published weekly.

European Commission plans 'gradual' integration of new EU members,"The European Commission on Wednesday recommended that future members of the European Union should be gradually integrated into the bloc through a ""reversible"" process.Brussels (dpa) - The idea is ""frontloading certain benefits and obligations of EUÂ membership"" before a country becomes a full member. Such ""gradual integration"" should be ""merit-based and reversible,"" said a commission report published on Wednesday. The commission is to ensure that ""both the EUÂ and future Member States are well-prepared"" for enlargement.Previous waves of enlargement, from 2004 onwards, have included transition periods that allowed existing members to limit labour market access for citizens of new member states for up to eight years. But such transition periods were not reversible, because the new countries were already full members and the restrictions had to be lifted by a set date.Besides labour market access for citizens, EU membership gives new member states decision-making power over EU laws, complicating an already messy legislative process. Enlargement also adds another country in which the commission needs to ""maintain undisputed respect for and continued application of the EU's core values,"" the report notes.In recent years, the commission has withheld EU budget payments to Hungary and Poland over rule of law concerns. Both countries joined the European Union in 2004.The commission's new approach offers ""enhanced avenues for 'gradual integration' of enlargement countries into selected EU policies, already before their accession.""But full access to the EU's market would require ""full adherence to a single comprehensive set of rights and obligations, which cannot be 'Ã  la carte,'"" the report said.The current candidates for EU membership are Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia, Albania, and the former Yugoslav republics of Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Turkey is also officially a candidate, though talks have stalled. (March 20)",1
"Nuclear energy is back – proponents adopt declaration in Brussels
","At the first-ever Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels, a number of countries pushed for nuclear power as a way to achieve carbon neutrality in the bloc by 2050 â€“ but opponents warn of the risks of expanding its production. At the same time, renewable energy also remains key to the EUâ€™s energy and climate debate. How divided is Europe on nuclear power?Promoting nuclear power was long taboo in Brussels, but a high-profile Nuclear Energy Summit sent the message that atomic energy – now touted by its champions as key to fighting climate change – is back. At the summit, 32 countries that currently operate nuclear power plants (NPP) or are looking to expand on nuclear energy all over the world adopted a Nuclear Energy Declaration. According to a press release, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the countries reaffirm their â€œstrong commitment to nuclear energy as a key component of our global strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from both power and industrial sectors, ensure energy security, enhance energy resilience, and promote long-term sustainable development and clean energy transitionâ€.The IAEAâ€™s first summit held to promote nuclear energy brought together representatives from some 50 countries – from the EU but also the United States and China – and 25 leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron. IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi recalled that at the climate conference COP28 it was agreed to â€œaccelerateâ€ the deployment of nuclear energy. Commenting on the summit, German leading climate politician for the Greens in the European Parliament, Michael Bloss, said: â€œNuclear power is a costly dead-end. Itâ€™s a massive subsidy game that simply doesn't pay off.â€ He added that â€œbuilding nuclear plants is incredibly expensive, takes ages, and doesnâ€™t even produce enough electricityâ€.Michael Bloss, MEP Greens/EFAIn the EU, the nuclear debate divides member states. One group – including Germany, Spain, Austria and Luxembourg – is clearly against its development, while another group – including France, Finland, Hungary and Romania– defends its potential.Proponents of nuclear energy promote it as a way to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, in accordance with the EUâ€™s climate targets. Those against expanding nuclear energy in Europe point at the high risks, as shown by the reactor disasters in Chernobyl (1986), which was part of the Soviet Union then, and in Fukushima, Japan (2011).Back in 2021, European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen made headlines by arguing the EU needed nuclear power as a â€œstable sourceâ€ of energy, and Brussels went on to label it among its list of sustainable investments.Nuclear reactors are currently in operation in twelve of the 27 EU member states, and two new nuclear power plants are under construction in Slovakia and France. By far the most are located in France. Poland also intends to restart a nuclear energy program and the Czech Republic, too, is planning to build new reactors, although it is not clear yet how many.France: the EUâ€™s nuclear championIn the past two years, atomic pioneer France has been decisive in crafting friendlier regulation and putting nuclear back on the EUâ€™s agenda. 56 of the 100 nuclear power plants in Europe are in France. The construction of 14 or possibly more new plants is being considered.As a nuclear power, France does not only rely on nuclear power for energy supply: Franceâ€™s Ministry of Defense recently announced that it wanted to enrich material containing lithium in two reactors at the NPP in the small town of Civaux in central France. The rare gas tritium, â€œa rare gas essential to the weapons of deterrenceâ€, will then be extracted from it.France is the only member of the European Union to possess nuclear weapons, after the United Kingdom officially left the bloc in 2020. The French Ministry of Defence has announced a collaboration with Ã‰lectricitÃ© de France (EDF), the countryâ€™s main energy company, to produce tritium.By early 2023, France was spearheading the launch of a â€œnuclear allianceâ€ of a dozen EU members including Poland, Bulgaria, Finland and the Netherlands, with a goal to weigh in on policy.France and Bulgaria signed an agreement in February in the field of nuclear energy, enabling industrial companies from both countries to participate in the maintenance of existing power plants and in new projects.In January, Bulgarian Energy Minister Rumen Radev and US Assistant Secretary of Energy for International Affairs, Andrew Light, also signed an intergovernmental agreement on cooperation on a nuclear project at the Kozloduy NPP site and a civilian nuclear programme in Bulgaria. On March 21, the Bulgarian Parliament voted conclusively to ratify the agreement.Franceâ€™s EDF is also one of the bidders for a new reactor in Dukovany (Czech Republic), along with South Korean company KHNP. The Czech government expects official bids in April. Contracts are expected to be signed in late 2024 and early 2025 and the first reactor to start operating in 2036.European nuclear energy ambitions growRomania intends to become a regional leader in the field of nuclear energy, its President Klaus Iohannis said at the Nuclear Energy Summit in Brussels. He emphasised that climate change represents â€œa global challengeâ€, which requires coordinated action and ambitious measures.Neighbouring Serbia does not have any experience with nuclear energy, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ said at the summit. He said Serbia faced three problems: a lack of know-how and experts on the use of nuclear power, a lack of funding and the present mindset of the people. He added that Serbia is interested in getting at least four small modular reactors (SMRs), but noted that it would need financial support from leading EU states.In Slovenia, a nuclear power plant has been operating in KrÅ¡ko, near the border with Croatia, since 1983. It generates about 40 percent of the countryâ€™s electricity, half of which belongs to Croatia, which co-owns the plant. In November, Slovenian citizens are expected to vote in a consultative referendum on the construction of a new nuclear power plant (Jek2), also in KrÅ¡ko.Sweden currently has six working nuclear reactors, in Forsmark, Oskarshamn and Ringhals, all built in the 1980s. Six older reactors were closed down between 1999 and 2020. Among them the BarsebÃ¤ck power plant, which – located in southern Sweden, close to Denmark – for many years was criticised by the neighbouring country. In Sweden, the question of nuclear power has been one of the main political issues during the last couple of years. Instead of phasing out the system, which was decided after a non-binding referendum in 1979, the current right-wing government is preparing for a heavy buildup with new reactors, both big and small. After many years of criticism, nuclear power is getting increasingly popular among the population and the political parties. Wind turbines in a wind farm stand out of the morning fog. Photo: Jan Woitas/dpaRenewables remain key in energy debateDespite the EUâ€™s more accommodating stance, the nuclear vs. renewables debate is still fuelling a standoff between Paris and Brussels: France failed to meet EU-set renewable targets in 2020, but is refusing to make amends – arguing that its carbon footprint is low enough due to nuclear power.Franceâ€™s stance is disliked by many environmental activists – and by EU countries like Spain, Austria, Germany and Luxembourg which together form a â€œFriends of Renewablesâ€ alliance within the bloc.German Green MEP Michael Bloss said: â€œWe need to ramp up efforts on expanding renewable energy. Reviving the nuclear debate now will only stall progress. Thatâ€™s how weâ€™re jeopardising our leadership in the Green Deal.â€German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has rejected calls for a return to nuclear power in Germany, pointing to high costs and long construction times. Electricity coming from nuclear power plants costs many times more than electricity from wind power, solar energy or other production sources, said Scholz.Despite having no nuclear power plants, Portugal has extensive legislation on nuclear matters, especially in the radiological field. There are many bodies in different ministries with responsibilities in this area – for example for controlling Spainâ€™s Almaraz nuclear power plant that uses water of the Tagus river (which runs in both countries) for cooling.The investment is targeted at renewable power sources which supplied 61 percent of Portugalâ€™s electricity in 2023, up from 49 percent a year earlier, hitting a new record after periods of heavy rains, strong winds and good doses of sunshine, grid operator REN said.Looking outside of the EU, North Macedonia, for example, also does not have any nuclear plants, but it has committed to a coal phase-out by 2027. North Macedonia has drafted the first laws and agreements on strategic investments in the energy sector, to facilitate and speed up investments in renewable electricity plants.

Eurozone countries expect economic recovery with inflation falling,"EU leaders in the eurozone expect falling inflation to bring an economic recovery but acknowledged ""economic activity is subdued in the near term""Â in a statement on Friday.Brussels (dpa) - The European Union economy needs to be ""more resilient and competitive""Â for the bloc to remain influential, European Council President Charles Michel said on X, formerly known as Twitter.Michel chaired the Brussels meeting of countries using the euro single currency convened to tackle sluggish economic growth in the eurozone.As well as working closer on public spending rules, EU leaders agreed to advance work towards improving the resources and efficiency of bloc's financial markets.Eurogroup President Pascal Donohoe said after the meeting he had ""never seen such an interest"" in the bloc's financial markets from EU leaders before.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde updated leaders on the bloc's inflation situation.A full meeting of the EU's 27 member states also discussed migration after assessing the bloc's economic worries as well as methods to appease the bloc's protesting farmers, angry over environmental regulations and falling incomes.On Thursday, the assembled prime ministers and presidents agreed to call for a ceasefire in Gaza, to use the revenues of seized Russian assets to help Ukraine, to bolster Europe's defence industry, and to open accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina.

EU regulator's block on Lufthansa's deal with Italy's ITA continues,"The European Commission has continued to block German airline Lufthansa's plans to acquire a minority stake in Italian airline ITA. The EU's competition watchdog warns of negative effects for consumers due to reduced competition.Brussels – EU anti-trust regulators maintain their objections to Lufthansa's planned minority stake in the Italian airline ITA Airways, the European Commission said on Monday. The top competition watchdog in the European Union reported concerns that customers could face higher prices and lower quality airline services in and out of Italy due to restricted competition.The commission first blocked Lufthansa's move to take a minority stake in ITA in January over similar competition issues and opened an investigation into the matter. Short-haul airline routes between Italy and central European countries were highlighted in the commission's report with Lufthansa and ITA competing on direct and indirect flights.Limited competition from Ryanair was the alternative for the region, the commission said. Reduced competition on long-haul routes between Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States was also noted. ITA's dominant position at Milan airport would also be reinforced.ITA was formed in 2020 after a restructuring of the failed Italian flag carrier Alitalia, which the government in Rome took over in March of the same year when various takeover bids failed. After months of negotiations, Lufthansa agreed with the Italian state last May to take over a minority stake of 41%. In return, ITA is to receive â‚¬325 million ($352 million) in equity from Lufthansa.Lufthansa already operates several hubs with the four airlines that currently comprise its network: Lufthansa, Austrian, Swiss and Brussels Airlines. Lufthansa and the Italian state may now respond to the commission's report and have until April 26 to suggest solutions to competition issues. A final decision is to come in June. (25 March)",1
Bosnia and Herzegovina: EU leaders agree to open membership talks,"The EU leaders' decision to initiate negotiation talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) marked a historic moment for the country. Seen as a political move amid shifting geopolitics, particularly after Ukraine was granted candidate status for EU membership, Bosnia still faces many hurdles on its path to EU accession.EU leaders agreed on Thursday to open talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) on joining the bloc, although negotiations will not begin until the Balkan country has passed more key reforms.""Congratulations! Your place is in our European family. Today's decision is a key step forward on your EU path"", European Council head Charles Michel wrote on X (formerly twitter), as leaders met at a summit in Brussels on March 22.https://twitter.com/CharlesMichel/status/1770903519828029902""Now the hard work needs to continue so Bosnia and Herzegovina steadily advances, as your people want,"" Michel said.More reformsBiH has been an official candidate for membership since 2022, but had to implement a number of reforms before it was given the green light to move to the next stage. Last week, Brussels said the country had completed some of the steps required, but some judicial and electoral reforms remain outstanding.Russia's war on Ukraine has reinvigorated the EU's drive to enlarge in eastern and central Europe, with member states agreeing in December to open talks with Ukraine and Moldova.The drive for new members is part of an effort to push back against Russian and Chinese influence in the EU's backyard.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Bosnia was now ""fully aligned"" with the EU's foreign and security policy, had improved its management of migration flows and had adopted laws to combat both money laundering and the financing of terrorism.She welcomed BiHâ€™s agreement to include the judgments of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in national criminal records.Von der Leyen noted further steps towards dialogue and reconciliation in the aftermath of the country's 1992-1995 war, with the creation of a new peace-building committee.Starting negotiations is only the beginning of a long process of further painstaking reforms that usually last for many years before a country finally joins the EU. The president of the Serb-majority entity Republika Srpska, Milorad Dodik, who remains a Kremlin ally, has held enormous sway over the Serb entity for years and has frequently stoked ethnic tensions and thus jeopardising Bosnia's path to the EU.Bosnia's regional neighbours, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania, are already ahead in their efforts to join, but all remain a long way from membership. Barriers to membershipThe decision to open accession negotiations was met with strong opposition from a group of member states, including the Netherlands, Denmark, France and Estonia, which argued that BiHâ€™s progress on the European path was still limited.The Dutch parliament was pondering to block the start of accession talks, but didn't tie Prime Minister Mark Rutte's hands in the end. Rutte warned that a veto would cause ""enormous damage"" to the Netherlands and convinced a majority to opt for a more lenient resolution. The parliament asked Rutte to block agreement on the negotiation framework, a procedural step before the real talks can start, until BiH has met the eight additional requirements set by the European Commission late last year. Thus, he was able to agree on the symbolic green light for the opening of the accession negotiations.On the other hand, the â€œFriends of the Balkansâ€ group, which includes several states such as Austria, Croatia, Italy, Hungary and Slovenia, has accelerated Sarajevo's progress in the integration process. ""It is a big step forward, in what we call reunification, the opening of negotiations for Bosnia and Herzegovina's accession to the EU"", said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob described the European Council's decision to open accession negotiations with the EU as an important step on Bosnia and Herzegovina's path towards the European family. The decision, he said, was also an important and encouraging message to the whole Western Balkans region, contributing to its stability, development and a better future. According to Juraj BlanÃ¡r, SlovakiaÂ´s Minister for Foreign and European Affairs, BosniaÂ´s accession to the EU is also in SlovakiaÂ´s interest. He recalled that the Western Balkan countries have been waiting for EU membership for more than two decades. Calls for reforms, predictable accession timetables for Ukraine, Moldova The outgoing Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa was among those who took a more cautious approach to enlargement: Although he did not oppose EU membership, for Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans, for example, he said on many occasions that the EU cannot speed up the process and decide on the basis of emotions - specifically referring to Ukraine.On October 6, after the informal European Council summit in Granada, Spain, Costa said that for â€œenlargement to be a success, it is fundamental to conclude the internal reforms"", advising against â€œmaking the reforms just for the sake of the enlargementâ€, adding that both processes â€œshould advance in a synchronised wayâ€. Costa also expressed concern that current fiscal architecture would not be able to cope with so many different economies, adding that this was why they were against setting a deadline for EU enlargement reforms were made.Romanian President Klaus Iohannis called for a predictable accession timetable for Ukraine and Moldova, for the rapid adoption of the negotiation frameworks proposed by the Commission and for organising the first intergovernmental conferences with the two candidate countries.Â Croatia strongly advocating BiHâ€™s accessionThe European Council's decision to open accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina is an incentive for the country to continue with reforms, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said, adding that changing the election law and ending the outvoting of Croats are key for that, as Croats believe not to be fairly represented in the institutions.""This decision [...] is a brilliant incentive for further reforms and catching up so BiH can enter the convoy which Ukraine and Moldova joined a little earlierâ€, PlenkoviÄ‡ said to Mostar-based Herceg-Bosna Radio-Television.PlenkoviÄ‡ said that BiH can accelerate its progress towards the EU by implementing reforms, as he believes that the electoral reform is the key issue. ""It's key to resolve the issue of legitimate representation of Croats in the BiH Presidency because this anomaly has existed since 2006.[...]  It's a message of disrespect for a constituent people and a distortion of the spirit, letter and agreement from Dayton [peace agreement]."" BiH has an electoral system based on three constituent ethnicities. Bosniak political parties advocate that the ethnic principle be abandoned in the electoral process. The Croats, who are three times less numerous than the Bosniaks in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, are afraid of being outvoted by the more numerous Bosniaks, which has already happened four times in the election of members of the collective presidency.Bulgaria calls on North Macedonia to recognize its minoritySpeaking at the Bucharest congress of the European People's Party (EPP), Bulgarian Deputy Prime Minister Mariya Iwanowa Gabriel vowed Bulgaria's support for Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia on their path towards EU accession. The process of EU enlargement towards the Western Balkans was the subject of a meeting between Bulgarian Prime Minister Nikolay Denkov and Slovenian President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar on February 27. ""Our region has a huge potential for development if we work together"", Denkov said, specifying that while Bulgaria supports EU enlargement, the candidate states must fulfil their commitments.On March 6, BulgariaÂ´s Foreign Ministry called on North Macedonia to implement the political commitments made in the 2022 compromise, which proposed that North Macedoniaâ€™s constitution shall be amended to recognize the Bulgarian minority in the country, thus clearing the way to EU membership talks.Enlargement for the remaining Western Balkans?The EUâ€™s Special Representative for the Belgrade-Pristina Dialogue, Miroslav LajÄÃ¡k, pointed out that the EU has opened the door for enlargement, including the Western Balkans region. ""The atmosphere in Brussels and the member states has really changed. The members are now seriously interested in enlargement. The doors are opening. Now it's about taking advantage of that opportunity. It's a geopolitical issue for Europe. Without the Balkan region, there is no complete integration"", he said.The European Council stated that internal reforms will be addressed at an upcoming meeting, aiming to adopt conclusions by summer 2024. Regarding North Macedonia, the US Special Representative to the Western Balkans Gabriel Escobar advocated for the country to become a full EU membership candidate. ""North Macedonia has been a very solid partner, both bilaterally and in multilateral fora such as NATO and the OSCE."" he posted on X. https://twitter.com/USEmbassySkopje/status/1768289576118825125He added that the US administration expected the new incoming government to be committed to NATO, EU accession and the fight against corruption.This article is published weekly.

"Institute says German economy is “struggling” and lowers forecasts
","A leading German economic research institute has significantly lowered its economic forecast for Europe's largest economy in the coming year.Berlin - The Kiel Institute for the World Economy (IfW) spoke on Wednesday of ""headwinds"" for the economy from within Germany and abroad.""The economy in Germany is struggling,"" said Stefan Kooths, from the IFW.The institute expects growth of only 0.1% this year. In the autumn they had assumed that gross domestic product would increase by 1.3% in 2024. The institute has left its forecast for next year virtually unchanged at 1.4%.In 2023, economic output in Europe's largest economy fell by 0.3%.  The IfW experts say that productivity in Germany has been ""treading water.""Private consumption is less dynamic than expected, and exports have declined despite rising global economic activity. The construction industry is also going through a deep trough.Although the economy should start to recover in the spring, the overall momentum will not be very strong.The institute also sees ""political uncertainty"" continuing to weigh on companies' investment activity. The German government is currently struggling to finalize a growth package, with Finance Minister Christian Lindner and Economy Minister Robert Habeck each having their own, different ideas.The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce says that the mood in the country's economy remains poor. Their Managing Director Martin Wansleben blamed high energy costs, and pointed to ""a worsening shortage of skilled labour and geopolitical uncertainties that are weighing on export business.""There is some good news for consumers, with the experts saying they believe the phase of very high inflation rates since the middle of last year is over. They expect consumer prices to rise by 2.3% this year and by 1.8% next year.",1
EU moves to tighten rules on Ukrainian agricultural imports,"In the latest concession to European farmers, the 27 EU member states have decided to impose stricter tariff rules on imported Ukrainian agricultural products. European farmers, who protested in Brussels again this week, were angry about unfair competition resulting from cheap imports.On Wednesday, the 27 EU member states agreed on a new compromise on customs requirements for certain Ukrainian agricultural products, the Belgian presidency of the Council of the EU announced.According to diplomats, the compromise stipulates that fewer goods than originally planned will be allowed to be sold duty-free into the EU. The products affected include eggs, poultry, sugar and maize. France and Poland had unsuccessfully sought to have wheat included in the list of Ukrainian farm products subject to the caps.Goods affected by the requirements will only be allowed to be imported into the EU duty free up to a certain amount. When this amount is reached, tariffs will apply again.Instead of basing the duty-free caps for those goods on average volumes from 2022 and 2023, France had been asking for 2021 to be included in the range to work out averages. According to diplomatic sources, the reference period will now also include the second half of 2021, when fewer of the affected Ukrainian goods were sold to the EU. This will mean that tariffs on Ukrainian produce will kick in sooner.The changes apply to an extension of one year, from June, of an EU arrangement that allows Ukrainian agricultural goods to enter the bloc duty-free.In a statement on Thursday, lobby group Copa-Cogeca called the deal a ""half-response"" that didnâ€™t go far enough. It called for automatic tariffs on wheat and barley in addition to lower quantities of goods like eggs, poultry and sugar that can enter the EU duty free.https://twitter.com/COPACOGECA/status/1773312393759609222Negotiators from the member states and the European Parliament already agreed on new customs requirements for Ukrainian goods last week, against the background of pressure from local farmers within the EU who don't want to lose revenue. Parliament is now due to give its final approval to the member statesâ€™ latest compromise agreement.Striking a balance: helping Ukraine or EU farmers?Since the start of 2024, farmers across Europe have protested against rising costs, the EU's environmental policy, and cheap food imports, including those from Ukraine.Farmers returned to Brussels with their tractors on Tuesday in protest against EU regulations and falling profits. They have been protesting in countries across the EU, from Belgium to France, Spain, Italy and Poland, over a long list of burdens they say are depressing revenue.The background to the debate is that the EU exempted Ukrainian goods from tariffs shortly after the start of Russia's war on its neighbouring country in 2022. This was intended to strengthen the Ukrainian economy.The EU is now also looking to impose tariffs on Russian grain imports to the bloc. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU did not want Russia to earn grain revenue from the bloc, or to ""influence"" the EU's market.EU leaders seek to restore balance between supporting Ukraineâ€™s economy and protecting EU agricultural producers. EU agricultural ministers met in Brussels on Tuesday to try to appease the farmers' anger with officials signing off on measures to loosen conditions for access to subsidies from the bloc's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).""In the Czech Republic as well, we see how the confidence of Czech and European farmers in the European Union has been shaken, and my concern is to be able to restore this confidence,"" the Czech Agriculture Minister Marek VÃ½bornÃ½ told Czech journalists.Farmers from Poland drive their vehicles towards the German-Polish border. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpaPolish blockade strains ties with UkrainePolish farmers have been blocking Ukrainian agricultural goods in protest to what they saw as unfair competition, while France has been making compromises to its own farmers to put down a revolt in the sector.Poland and Ukraine were closer to resolving a conflict over farm imports, Warsaw said Wednesday, on the eve of bilateral talks on the issue that has angered the countryâ€™s farmers. ""We can say there's been a certain rapprochement between the respective positions, but of course ... each is fighting for himself,"" Poland's Agriculture Minister CzesÅ‚aw Siekierski told AFP.The border blockades and grain dispute have strained ties between the neighbours, even as Poland has shown staunch support for Ukraine since the Russian invasion. Warsaw has been calling for an EU ceiling on Ukraine imports, after having imposed one unilaterally last year.The Danish minister for Agriculture Jacob Jensen said: â€œThere are things in this world that are more important than anything else. On the security and foreign policy front, we must support Ukraine as much as we possibly can.â€Jacob Jensen, Minister for Agriculture of DenmarkHe added that â€œwe do this militarily, but we must also do it in terms of ensuring that Denmark and the EU do not put obstacles in the way of them being able to sell their goods and support the economy.â€ Jensen acknowledged that there may be local markets, such as Poland, that are particularly challenged.Concessions to farmers mount ahead of EU electionsItaly emphasised its flexibility to take into consideration both the needs of Ukraine as well as the concerns expressed by the other EU member states and the agricultural sector. It supported the Belgian presidency's proposal – to extend the reference period for duty-free caps to also include the second half of 2021 – and highlighted the need for the Commission to enhance the monitoring of the impacts of wheat and cereal imports from Ukraine, with the activation of general safeguards even if problems were to affect only one member state.Slovenian Agriculture Minister Mateja ÄŒaluÅ¡iÄ‡ emphasised that the proposals for changes to the CAP should take into account the natural conditions and specificities of individual EU member states, in order to make it easier to adapt and find quick solutions. ""We consider that to be welcome in order to make farming easier in Slovenia,"" she said.Slovenia supported the agreement on stricter customs rules for Ukrainian goods. As a small country, it was highly susceptible to price fluctuations and therefore very sensitive to any additional volumes of agricultural products on the EU common market, the Slovenian Ministry of Economy said.The latest in a string of concessions to European farmers come less than three months before bloc-wide elections for the European Parliament. Surveys predict the vote will result in a surge of support for far-right parties that are using farmers' discontent as part of their campaigning.The European Parliament now has to look at the member statesâ€™ agreement before voting on it next month, with a view to it coming into effect before the current exemption period runs out on June 5. If no new regulations are put in place by then, the special rules will no longer apply.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
"China profiting from EU climate policy on cars, says EPP chief Weber","Last year, EU member states decided to ban the sale of new combustion engine vehicles from 2035. Meanwhile, the number of Chinese electric carmakers entering the European market is growing.Berlin (dpa) – China is profiting from the European Union's climate policy, German lawmaker and head of the centre-right European People's Party (EPP) Manfred Weber said. The European party he heads has spoken out in favour of the combustion engine.It is clear ""that the ban on the combustion engine was a serious industrial policy mistake from which China is benefiting,"" the EPP leader told the German Funke media group newspapers. We want to ""remedy this after the European elections,"" Weber said in reports published on Sunday.He was referring to a decision by EU member states last year to ban new cars with combustion engines, despite efforts by Berlin to block the move. Germany is a major producer of cars with combustion engines and its car industry is a key sector in the German economy.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently said the combustion engine decision would be reviewed in 2026.The Green Deal, as EU climate policy measures are known, should not become a ""China Deal,"" said Weber, noting the growing number of electric carmakers from China entering the European market. German carmakers including Volkswagen and BMW are lagging behind their Chinese rivals in terms of e-car sales.Germans are only slowly embracing e-cars, the countryâ€™s Federal Motor Transport Authority data shows, with nearly 1.41 million purely battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) registered on 1 January in Germany, some one in 35 currently driving on German roads.Growth in electric car sales could slow in 2024 since the cancellation of state subsidies. At just under 50,000, new BEV registrations in January and February were well below the average figures for the previous year. However, the German governing coalition, which includes the Green Party, hopes to have 15 million electric cars on the road by 2030. (31 March)",1
Europe braces for more defence,"More than two years into Moscowâ€™s war against its neighbour, Ukraine, Kievâ€™s troops are struggling to hold back the Russian army as Western deliveries of weapons have faltered.â€œWar is no longer a concept from the past, it is real,â€ Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk warned in an interview with European media outlets last week. Just recently, on March 24, the Polish military had detected a violation of its airspace for a total time of 39 seconds by a Russian missile, after Polish airspace had already been violated at the end of December. â€œThe most worrying thing is that every scenario is possible. I know it sounds devastating, especially for the younger generation, but we have to get used to the fact that a new era has begun: the pre-war era,â€ Tusk said. Kiev has warned its stocks of munitions are running low, as it is incessantly asking for patriots, ammunition, missiles and aircraft to defend itself against the Russian advance.In an interview with the Financial Times, the presidents of Latvia and Estonia, Edgars RinkÄ“viÄs and Alar Karis, urged the other European allies to do more to prepare for a possible armed confrontation with Russia, examining everything from conscription to a special defence tax and a significant increase in military spending.In particular, for the Latvian head of state, European countries should discuss the return of compulsory military service in order to increase the number of defence forces. â€œIt is necessary to seriously discuss conscription,â€ RinkÄ“viÄs said, emphasising that armed forces across Europe have difficulties recruiting. Another element is a return to the spending levels â€œof the Cold War eraâ€. â€œHere, in this part of Europe and the world, we understand that we need to get to three percent,â€ RinkÄ“viÄs explained to the British newspaper. Karis cited that the US accounts for 68 percent of all defence spending within NATO, 860 billion dollar last year compared to 404 billion dollar for European members and Canada. â€œWe have to do something,â€ he warned, â€œat least make it 50-50.â€ Tensions between Germany, France and Poland over how best to support Ukraineâ€œWe stand together,â€ German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on March 20 at a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. â€œWe will support Ukraine for as long as necessary,â€ the German chancellor said, adding that he would also ensure that the NATO alliance does not become directly involved in the fighting. The German leader disagrees with Macronâ€™s belief that NATO allies should leave open the possibility of deploying combat troops to Ukraine at some point in the future. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said to the Italian Senate that she is also not in favour of sending NATO troops to combat as this would be â€œa dangerous escalation that must be avoided at all costs,â€ she said. Scholzâ€™s meeting with Tusk and Macron came amid public disagreements and tensions between Germany and its allies over how best to support Ukraine. Scholz has come under international criticism for his refusal to send long-range Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine, which he argues would risk escalating the conflict.â€œTo put it bluntly: as German chancellor, I will not be sending any soldiers from our Bundeswehr to Ukraine,â€ Scholz said in response to Macronâ€™s comments, using the German name for the countryâ€™s military.Polandâ€™s defence minister has backed Macronâ€™s stance and again criticised Scholz on March 20 for his refusal to send Taurus missiles to Ukraine.Donald Tusk, Prime Minister of Poland, makes a press statement after a joint meeting in the German Chancellery. Photo: Christoph Soeder/dpaGermany to increase defence budgetGerman Finance Minister Christian Lindner sees scope of up to nine billion euros in the federal budget from 2028 to increase the defence budget. With disciplined budget management, the debt ratio will then once again be below the 60 percent of economic output prescribed by the EU, the liberal leader told the German Press Agency dpa. â€œIf we fall below this limit, then the repayment of coronavirus debt planned from 2028 could be discussed again.â€ The money could flow into the defence budget instead.The federal government had taken out emergency loans totalling around 300 billion euros in 2020, 2021 and 2022 due to the coronavirus crisis and the war in Ukraine. Repayment is actually scheduled to begin in 2028 and run for more than 30 years. Currently, a debt repayment of nine billion euros per year is planned, according to  Lindner. â€œHowever, if the burden of the pandemic on the debt level has already been overcome by then, the repayment could be significantly reduced,â€ he announced. â€œThis would make billions available, which will help us achieve the leap to the NATO target in the federal budget after the end of the special programme for the Bundeswehr.â€ According to the latest calculations by NATO, Germany achieved a rate of 1.66 per cent in 2023.France pushing for production increaseMeanwhile, the French government is pushing defence companies to ramp up production to meet the needs of its own army and to ensure continued support to Ukraine after more than two years of war with Russia.Franceâ€™s defence minister Sebastien Lecornu said Paris would deliver â€œhundredsâ€ of armoured personnel carriers and anti-aircraft missiles as part of a new aid package to Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders.â€œTo hold such an extensive front line, the Ukrainian army needs for example our VAB vehicles: itâ€™s absolutely essential for troop mobility,â€ Lecornu told the La Tribune newspaper in an interview published on Saturday. France is currently phasing out its VAB tank fleet – some of them more than 40 years old – with new Griffon armoured vehicles, but Lecornu said the older models were â€œstill operationalâ€.â€œWe are also developing remotely operated munitions in a very short timeframe, to deliver them to Ukraine starting this summer,â€ Lecornu added.EU reaffirms Ukraine supportâ€œWe reaffirmed the unity of Europe,â€ European Council President Charles Michel summed up the first day of the summit in Brussels on March 21. Michel promised that the 27 member states want to â€œmove forward quicklyâ€ on the revenues from Russian assets, that they â€œunderstand the seriousness of the situation and are determined to do more for Kievâ€. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that with the agreement on the revenues from the assets, three billion euros could be available this year to be spent on the purchase of military equipment to be sent to Kiev. The first billion euros could be spent as early as July if â€œwe are quick to take the necessary decisionsâ€.   Regarding defence, Michel assured â€œa paradigm shift in the European projectâ€, which was based on cooperation and prosperity, while defence â€œwas left to national competencesâ€. â€œToday,â€ he emphasised, â€œwe have decided to strengthen the European pillar.â€How are member states gearing up their defence?  The Romanian Army participates with 400 troops and 50 vehicles in the military operations of the European Union, stated the Chief of the Defense Staff, general GheorghiÈ›Äƒ Vlad, during a meeting attended by the Secretary of State for defence policy, planning and international relations, Simona Cojocaru, and the president of the EU Military Committee, General Robert Brieger, on Thursday. Brieger highlighted Romaniaâ€™s contribution to European collective security, as well as the efforts made within the various initiatives of the Strategic Compass.Slovenian Defence Minister Marjan Å arec has expressed the wish for Slovenia to no longer be just a buyer, but also to become a seller and producer of military equipment. In June 2023, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) signed contracts with leading defence companies for a new drone and the development of a combat station. In 2023, the MoD signed 80.9 million euros worth of military equipment contracts with Slovenian companies, almost 60 million euros more than in 2022, including companies importing military equipment. The Ministry is also intensively increasing Research and Development (R&D) funding, which amounted to 11.7 million euros in 2023 and is expected to reach 23 million euros this year. Sloveniaâ€™s estimated defence expenditure for 2023 is 845 million euros, representing 1.34 percent of GDP, and is expected to reach two percent of GDP by 2030.Bulgariaâ€™s outgoing Defence Minister Todor Tagarev underscored on March 29 that the countryâ€™s defence budget for 2024 has increased by over 60 percent compared to 2022. At the end of this year there could be 20,982 soldiers and 4,500 employees in the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, a proposal by the by the ministry of defence states. This is an increase of 279 soldiers compared to the currently approved number, according to the Slovak Republic Ministry of Defence.In Portugal, the lack of new recruits and soldiers leaving the three branches of the Armed Forces has been a prevalent issue. At the same time, Portugalâ€™s spending on defence is still very low compared to what NATO wants it to be. According to NATOâ€™s secretary general report from last year, published on March 14, Portugalâ€™s spending in defence, in percentage of its GDP, was at 1.48 percent, still below the two percent that is requested for all 31 countries. Last year, the former Minister of Defence, Helena Carreiras, admitted that the country would only be able to reach that target in 2030. Portugal isnâ€™t a key player in manufacturing in the defence industry, opting only to participate in the effort to acquire more ammunition as a buyer, together with other EU countries.Last Friday, the Portuguese Chief of Staff of the Navy, Henrique Gouveia e Melo, spoke out in favour of the compulsory military service, which officially ended in 2004. His views were later supported by the Chief of Staff of the Army, Eduardo FerrÃ£o. However, several military associations discarded the idea, preferring to focus on career appreciation with higher wages and more attractive conditions.North Macedonia to ramp-up productionThe Minister of Defence of North Macedonia, Slavjanka Petrovska, said that the domestic military industry is increasing production capacities to compete on the NATO market. North Macedonia joined the NATO initiative for the support of ammunitionâ€™s production and defence industry, which will enable the country to receive necessary armaments much faster for much more favourable prices.The Ministry of Defence signed an agreement for cooperation with the only company for production of small-calibre ammunition in North Macedonia, â€œATS AMMOâ€ from Samokov, for development and production of drones. Additionally, the Ministry of Defence procured eight multi-purpose transport helicopters manufactured by the Italian company â€œLeonardoâ€ for 249.9 million euros. The first helicopter is set to be delivered during the second half of 2026.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
German customs detains ship with EU-sanctioned Russian cargo at Baltic Sea port,"German customs detained a ship in a Baltic Sea port on suspicion it was carrying Russian goods sanctioned by the EU. Following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the bloc imposed numerous sanctions on the country, including on trade with the EU.Rostock, Germany (dpa) – German customs authorities have detained a cargo ship that arrived from Russia at the German Baltic Sea port of Rostock because of suspicions about the ship's contents, authorities announced on Tuesday.The ship, a 193-metre-long freighter, had arrived at the port on March 4 for repairs due to technical problems with its propeller, likely caused by voyaging through icy seas, German authorities said.German customs officials pointed out that the ship's cargo, like all goods brought into the European Union, was subject to customs supervision and inspection. German customs officials also contend that restrictions on foreign trade imposed by EU sanctions on Russia apply as well.""Due to EU-sanctioned goods on board, the ship has received a detention order from customs. Leaving the port is therefore prohibited,"" the Rostock Port and Seamen's Office announced on Tuesday.According to a report by the Ostsee-Zeitung newspaper, the ship was on its way to the United States and was loaded with birch wood and enriched uranium for US nuclear power plants, among other things. The newspaper said its information had been confirmed by multiple unnamed sources, and placed the value of the cargo at around 40 million euros (43 million dollars).After Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU imposed a raft of sanctions, seeking to halt the Kremlin's war. However, there is no EU import ban on uranium.The sanctions in place apply to a total of more than 1,700 people and over 400 organisations. Steel, steel products and iron, gold and diamonds, including jewellery, cement, asphalt, wood, paper, synthetic rubber and plastics may not be imported under the restrictions, for example.

German transport minister says more bicycle infrastructure needed,"At a meeting of EU transport ministers in Brussels, German Transport Minister Volker Wissing called for more cycling infrastructure in Germany and the EU. He also advocated the use of synthetic fuels for cars to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Brussels (dpa) – With more electric bicycles, or E-bikes, now on the roads, German Transport Minister Volker Wissing said Germany needs to consider expanded infrastructure for cyclists.""Due to the new ranges achieved with the electrification of bicycles, we also need new transport infrastructure,"" Wissing said on Wednesday at a meeting of EU transport ministers in Brussels. Cycling paths and parking spaces for bicycles are among the transport infrastructure that Wissing said may need to be expanded.Wissing, a member of the free-market conservative Free Democratic Party (FDP), said that it is also important to strengthen the railroads. But he also argued that young people would continue to obtain driving licenses and that cars would continue to be used in the future.He made it clear that road traffic must emit fewer greenhouse gases more quickly, and once again called for greater consideration of so-called e-fuels instead of just battery electric vehicles in the future.By using e-fuels, or synthetic fuels that are made in a more climate friendly way rather than traditional petrol or diesel, internal combustion engines could theoretically be operated in a climate-neutral way.However, e-fuels for cars are also criticised because experts say that those kinds of fuels are relatively energy intensive to produce and will be more urgently needed in the maritime shipping and aviation industries.""We need such fuels,"" Wissing said at the meeting of EU transport ministers on Wednesday in Brussels, noting that Germany is organising an international conference on ""e-fuels"" later this year."" We need the diversity of drive systems in order to make faster progress in the decarbonisation of transport,"" he said. (3 April)",1
"EU financial police arrest 22, seize funds in 600-million-euro fraud case","Financial police in several EU countries has arrested 22 persons for allegedly using a network of fictitious companies to apply for money from the NextGenerationEU recovery programme. Rome (dpa) – Financial police in Italy, Austria, Romania and Slovakia have arrested 22 people and seized around 600 million euros in connection with a European Public Prosecutor's Office (EPPO) investigation of criminal organisations trying to defraud the EU.On Thursday, the prosecutor's office said that eight people are in custody and 14 are under house arrest. Two further suspects have been banned from working and trading. The majority of the suspects have a criminal record.The suspects are alleged to have used a network of fictitious companies to apply for money from the EU-funded NextGenerationEU recovery programme and then embezzled it, the EPPO said. The crimes took place between 2021 and 2023, the office alleged.Specifically, the alleged criminal organisation was concerned with funds from the Italian National Recovery Programme or PNRR.Using fictitious companies and with the involvement of front men, the suspects applied for large sums of money for various project initiatives, according to the police statement. They are also accused of laundering huge illegal profits.The Venice financial police played a leading role in the investigation, reportedly acting on a request from the EPPO and enforcing a court order to freeze assets totalling more than 600 million euros.The NextGenerationEU recovery programme, worth more than 800 billion euros, is intended to help EU countries get back on their feet after the coronavirus pandemic. As a particularly hard-hit country, Italy is to receive the largest sum from the programme at almost 200 billion euros.In order to receive the aid, member states must submit a plan with concrete investment and reform projects.

"Recycling and waste management in Europe: See it, say it, sort it?","The UN recently stated that one billion meals worldwide get thrown out daily and just one percent of rare earth element demand is met by e-waste recycling, according to the International Telecommunications Union and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research. While the EU is working hard to cut waste, up recycling and double the Unionâ€™s circularity rate by 2030, experts are unsure whether these efforts are enough. Every year, all economic activities and households in the EU generate more than two billion tonnes of waste. That is equivalent to 4.8 tonnes of waste per capita.According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), the overall recycling rate in 2020 stood at 46 percent. This figure includes three waste streams: municipal, packaging as well as electrical and electronic waste. In 2021, 64 percent of packaging waste, 49 percent of municipal waste and 39 percent percent of so-called e-waste was recycled. However, the majority of waste in 2021 was still disposed of through landfill operations and incineration. â€œWe are still far from the ambition to double the Unionâ€™s circularity rate by 2030,â€ the EEA said, adding that there was a â€œlow or moderate likelihoodâ€ that EUâ€™s ambitions would be â€œachieved in the coming yearsâ€. The EUâ€™s plan for a circular economy aims to lessen the strain on natural resources by doubling its circular material use rate (CMUR) between 2020-2030. CMUR reflects how much recycled waste contributes to the total material used in the economy.At the heart of the problem, according to the EEA, are business models in which products have a very short lifespan – if they are even used at all. At the same time, with its circularity rate of 11.5 percent in 2022, Europe still uses more recycled materials than any other region in the world.EU legislation on waste, including more than 30 binding targets for the 2015-2030 period, is a key driver in increasing the levels of recycling in the Union. In March, the Union made further progress in waste regulation in a bid to meet the blocâ€™s climate goals, aiming at increased recycling and cutting of plastic. On March 25, the Council of the EU adopted a revision of the Waste Shipment Regulation. According to this EU states are to export less waste to third countries and recycle more themselves.Under the new rule, waste may only be exported to countries outside the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) if the destination country explicitly agrees and can prove that the waste is processed in an environmentally friendly manner to try to reach the goals of circular economy and climate neutrality.According to figures from the statistics office Eurostat, the EU exported over 32 million tonnes of waste to non-EU countries in 2022. Of this, 39 percent went to Turkey (12.4 million tonnes), followed by India (3.5 million tonnes), the United Kingdom (2.0 million tonnes), Switzerland (1.6 million tonnes) and Norway (1.6 million tonnes).What are recent developments in the EU?On March 13, the European Parliament approved a proposal to curb food and textile waste. EU lawmakers voted to slash 40 percent of the food waste generated by households, retailers and restaurants by 2030, while toughening rules on textile waste linked to so-called â€œfast-fashionâ€. Brussels estimates that the 27-nation bloc generates 60 million tonnes of food waste a year – or 131 kilograms per person.On March 4, EU negotiators agreed on the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation (PPWR), to cut back on packaging waste by five percent by 2030, compared to the amount in 2018. The aim is to reduce this further by ten percent in 2035 and 15 percent by 2040. Single-use plastics in cafÃ©s and restaurants will be banned from 2030. The text is a key element of the EUâ€™s environmental goals under the Green Deal. â€œThis regulation aims to reduce waste caused by packaging, making it more sustainable, while ensuring the highest waste management standards,â€ the government of Belgium, which holds the rotating EU presidency, said on X.https://twitter.com/EU2024BE/status/1764715924966216185Still, according to a new report the OECD anticipates that the amount of plastic packaging will triple by 2060. Some environmentalists argue that increased recycling does not address the root problem.Looking at waste across the bloc: give-and-take? While some EU countries focus on expanding their recycling capabilities, import – or export – of waste is an important part of other nationsâ€™ economies.SwedenIn Sweden, a massive high-tech sorting plant dubbed â€œSite Zeroâ€ has been in operation since late 2023, described by the organisation as â€œthe world's largest and most modern facility for plastic recyclingâ€. Mattias Philipsson, CEO of Swedish Plastic Recycling, a non-profit organisation owned by the plastic industry, said the site has â€œthe capacity to handle the equivalent of all of Swedenâ€™s plastic wasteâ€.In 2022, only 35 percent of plastic waste was recycled, according to the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, less than the EU average of 40 percent. The incineration of plastic waste, which is used to produce both heat and electricity, accounts for about seven percent of Swedenâ€™s greenhouse gas emissions.PortugalIn 2021, according to the most recent official data, 71,182 tonnes of hazardous waste left Portugal for recovery and 1,385 for disposal. Usually, that type of waste requires special disposal treatment. 1,066 million tonnes of non-hazardous waste were shipped or exported.According to data from the Portuguese Environment Agency, Spain is the main country of destination, receiving 80 per cent of the total non-hazardous waste while Belgian incinerators received 90 per cent of the hazardous waste. Regarding exports outside the EU, Portugal only exports non-hazardous waste to Morocco (597 tonnes for recovery). The country also imports waste: 264,874 tonnes of hazardous waste came in, most of it for recovery (244,959) and disposal (almost 20,000 tonnes). The country also received 1.817 million tonnes of non-hazardous waste. SloveniaAccording to the Slovenian Environment Agency, Slovenia has generated an average of around135,000 tonnes of hazardous waste per year between 2012-2021, accounting for one to three percent of all waste. During this period, the country exported an annual average of 61,400 tonnes of hazardous waste for final treatment/disposal, mainly to EU and Balkan countries, while it imported an average of 34,200 tonnes of hazardous waste per year. RomaniaAccording to official statistics, Romania is currently ranking 26th among the 27 EU member states when it comes to recycling, with its recycled municipal waste exceeding by only 13 per cent of the total waste.By implementing a Guarantee-Return System (SGR) in November 2023 to collect beverage packaging, more than 220 million packages were returned in the first three months. At present, two regional centres are operating with another five set to open in the next three months.BulgariaWaste import designed for utilisation is extremely important for the Bulgarian economy and, in particular, for the processing industry, according to Environment and Water Minister Julian Popov. This waste was predominantly of non-hazardous nature and of high quality and value as raw material, he said.In 2021, the amount of household waste generated in Bulgaria decreased by 25 percent compared to 2010, according to the National Report on the State and Protection of the Environment but it still fell short of the 51 percent recycling goal, according to data by the Bulgarian Executive Environment Agency.  The trend of meeting the recycling targets for electrical and electronic equipment waste has been maintained. The increase in recycled materials utilised in the country's economy is up to 4.90 percent, the report shows.In November 2023, the European Commission called on several countries, including Bulgaria, to properly implement EU rules on waste treatment.Models present creations by French fashion designer Maud Beneteau during a fashion show at the Carthage Museum at the launch of the haute couture brand ""Outa"", completely made from recycled plastic. Photo: FETHI BELAID/AFPTextile waste: recycled plastic â€œnot circularityâ€To square the recycling circle, fashion brands have been using recycled plastic – to the frustration of the food industry, which pays for the collection of used PET bottles.â€œLetâ€™s be clear: this is not circularity,â€ the beverage industry wrote in a withering open letter to the European Parliament last year, denouncing the â€œworrying trendâ€ of the fashion industry making â€œgreen claims related to the use of recycled materialâ€.Less than one percent of textiles worldwide are recycled at present, the EU says, with 12.6 million tonnes of textile waste generated in the EU each year.A recent EEA study showed that four to nine percent of textiles introduced to the European market ended up being destroyed without ever having been used, leading to 5.6 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.Nearly half of all textile waste collected in Europe ends up in African second-hand markets or more often it is tipped into â€œopen landfillsâ€, according to EEA figures from 2019. Another 41 percent of the blocâ€™s textile waste goes to Asia, mostly â€œto dedicated economic zones where they are sorted and processedâ€.NGOs said much of Europeâ€™s waste clothes sent to Asia go to â€œExport Processing Zonesâ€, which Paul Roeland of the Clean Clothes Campaign NGO said were â€œnotorious for providing â€˜lawlessâ€™ exclaves, where even the low labour standards of Pakistan and India are not observedâ€. Switched off: e-waste efforts lack energyAround 62 million tonnes of old or unwanted gadgets were thrown out in 2022.The volume of so-called e-waste, which includes mobile phones, TVs and vapes, is â€œrising five times faster than documented recyclingâ€, according to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research (UNITAR), who define e-waste as any discarded product with a plug or battery.The amount recorded in 2022 was over 80 percent higher than in 2010. â€œBillions of dollars worth of strategically valuable resources squandered, dumped. Just one percent of rare earth element demand is met by e-waste recycling,â€ they warned.Food Waste: ""global tragedy""Households around the world threw away one billion meals every single day in 2022 in what the United Nationsâ€™ latest Food Waste Index Report on March 27 called a â€œglobal tragedyâ€ of food waste. More than one trillion dollars worth of food was binned by households and businesses at a time when nearly 800 million people were going hungry.It said that more than one billion tonnes of food – almost one fifth of all the produce available on the market – was wasted in 2022, most of it by households. â€œIf food waste was a country, it would be the third biggest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet behind the US and China,â€ said Richard Swannell from non-profit organisation WRAP, who co-authored the report with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).The report is just the second on global food waste compiled by the UN and provides the most complete picture to date.This article is published weekly.

TUI moves share trading from London to the Frankfurt stock exchange,"TUI's move from the London stock exchange to Frankfurt should help the travel group to comply with EU rules on air traffic rights, facilitated by having its headquarters within the bloc.Frankfurt (dpa) – The world's largest travel group TUI is once again a German company, listed on the Frankfurt stock market.""Frankfurt is our stock exchange again as of today,"" TUI Group CEO Sebastian Ebel said on Monday.The company was listed in London for almost 10 years. The initial share price was 7.73 euros. The shares will still be listed in London until June, when trading there will be discontinued. Only 22 percent of share trading still took place in London in 2023.The Group expects cost savings from concentrating on Frankfurt, higher demand for its shares, and thus rising share prices as a result of its inclusion in the MDAX, the German index for medium-sized companies, which it hopes to rejoin on June 24.The move should also help the Group to secure the conditions for air traffic rights in the European Union in the future. The EU requires that airlines such as the group's TUIfly, which operates within the EU, to be majority-owned and controlled by owners from the EU. This will be easier to ensure with a head office in Frankfurt, the company said. (April 8)",1
Big tech in the crosshairs of EU digital legislation,"Ever since the introduction of two landmark EU digital laws â€“ the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) â€“ the European Commission has targeted big tech companies and online platforms over various compliance concerns.In the EU, two major laws regulating big tech companies and online platforms are currently in force – the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA).Â  Recently, the European Commission has been clamping down on companies covered by the rulebooks to ensure that the digital laws are being enforced.The Commission has identified a number of concerns which will be at the forefront for the coming weeks and months: some about adverse effects on competition in digital markets – under the DMA – and others about negative effects for usersâ€™ experience on digital services and platforms – under the DSA.The DSA is a content moderation law that forces big tech to do more to confront illegal and harmful content, as well as fake online material. It came into effect for very large online platforms and search engines in August 2023, and entered into full force for all online platforms in the EU in February 2024. The DMA is designed to limit the market dominance of big tech by regulating the behaviour of companies the Commission deems to be â€œgatekeepersâ€ in the digital economy. A gatekeeper is a company that holds a powerful, entrenched position in the EUâ€™s digital economy, acting as an intermediary between many users and businesses. The rules took effect on March 7.The latest legal action came at the end of March, when the European Commission opened investigations into Apple, Google parent company Alphabet and Meta (â€œFacebookâ€) because it suspects that they are not complying with the DMA.https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1772202440953123231â€œThese decisions to open non-compliance investigations come only two weeks after the implementation deadline has passed and show that DMA compliance is something that we take very seriously,â€ European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager said after announcing the probes.â€œThe timing of these announcements, while the DMA compliance workshops are still ongoing, makes it look like the Commission could be jumping the gun,â€ said the head of the Computer and Communications Industry Association (CCIA) Europe, Daniel Friedlaender. The tech lobby groupâ€™s members include Apple, Google and Meta.Big tech scrutinised over competition concernsUnder the DMA, the Commission has designated six â€œgatekeepersâ€: Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, Tiktok-owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft.Under the launched investigations, the Commission believes that Apple and Alphabet/Google have not taken effective measures to allow mobile application developers to freely communicate with their customers to provide them with offers outside of the app stores of these two companies (the App Store and Google Play) and without having to pay them a fee. The Commission also suspects that Alphabet/Google favours its own Google Shopping, Google Flights or Google Hotels in searches over rivals.Furthermore, Meta is being investigated over its recently-introduced policy of asking users to choose between paying to use its services and consenting to their personal data being shared between the companyâ€™s services – such as Facebook and Instagram – for use in targeted advertising.In parallel to the investigations opened under the DMA, the Commission also announced the launch of â€˜investigative initiativesâ€™ to verify whether Amazon favours its products on the Amazon Store and, again on Apple, whether Appleâ€™s new pricing structure complies with the DMA.The European Commission intends to conclude its investigations into Apple, Alphabet/Google and Meta under the DMA within 12 months. If after completing the investigation their suspicions are confirmed, Brussels will explain to the companies what measures they must take or what the Commission itself will adopt, which could mean a fine of ten percent of their global turnover or 20 percent if they repeatedly violate the regulations.The screens of a tablet (L) and a smartphone show news on the website of Russian TV channel RT. Photo: Fernando Gutierrez-Juarez/dpa-Zentralbild/dpaDisinformation and deepfakes loom ahead of EU electionsLast month, the EU also demanded more information from TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, Google, YouTube, Snapchat and Bing on what measures they are taking to tackle risks of artificial intelligence, including from deepfakes – on this occasion under the Digital Services Act. The Digital Services Act is the EUâ€™s biggest tool for content moderation. Under it the bloc has designated 22 digital platforms as â€œvery largeâ€, including Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and X. The latter has already been under investigation since December over content moderation.The call for companies to take measures against AI-related risks is part of a raft of guidelines published under the landmark content law by the European Commission for digital giants to tackle risks to elections including disinformation. The Commission has unleashed a string of measures to clamp down on big tech, especially regarding content moderation.Brussels especially fears the impact of Russian manipulation and disinformation on elections taking place in the blocâ€™s 27 member states on June 6–9.â€œWith todayâ€™s guidelines we are making full use of all the tools offered by the DSA to ensure platforms comply with their obligations and are not misused to manipulate our elections, while safeguarding freedom of expression.â€Thierry Breton, European Commissioner for Internal MarketFor years tech titans have self-regulated under codes of practice on disinformation but must now comply with EU rules or risk fines of up to six percent of a platformâ€™s global turnover. Companies covered by the European Commissionâ€™s request had to provide the Commission with the requested information by 5 April for election protection issues will have to inform it by April 26 for the remaining issues.Individual EU member states also implement the DSA in their own national legislation, which is not always uncontroversial in domestic politics. In Romania, for example, a national law for the application of the DSA entered into force on March 22. The law creates a mechanism through which public authorities or institutions with competence in certain sectors or fields of activity can issue orders for the removal of certain content considered illegal under national rules and for fines in case of non-compliance. According to the law, the National Authority for Management and Regulation in Communications (ANCOM) is responsible for all aspects related to the supervision and enforcement of the DSA. The Romanian political opposition, however, accuses ANCOM of setting up an â€œinternet policeâ€.This article is published weekly.

Von der Leyen urges EU red tape to be cut to boost competitiveness,"According to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the EU must â€œstep up a gearâ€ in order to safeguard its position in the field of competitiveness worldwide.Berlin (dpa) – European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted cutting bureaucracy amid efforts to make the European Union more competitive, in remarks to German business leaders in Berlin on Tuesday.""We continue to be the economic area that exports the most worldwide. But I'm saying clearly that we have to step up a gear to secure what has been achieved and to remain ahead. We have to become faster, more digital and cleaner,"" the German politician said.Cutting EU red tape was making progress, she said, with reporting requirements for companies being reduced.Rainer Dulger, head of the Confederation of German Employers (BDA), said the EU had made life difficult for companies with over-complicated regulation. ""We need to change that,"" he added.According to Dulger, competitiveness had to return to the top of the agenda in Europe. ""We have to be faster, we have to become more digital, and we must also become simpler,"" he said. The right EU decisions could make Europe a growth driver, he added. The EU should stop its increasing intervention in member states' social policies, the head of the BDA concluded. (9 April)",1
EU competition watchdog approves 2 billion euros of German state aid,"The European Commission has approved a German state aid scheme worth 2 billion euros to help industrial businesses reduce their carbon emissions and switch to more renewable energy sources.Brussels (dpa) – On Wednesday, the European Commission, the top competition regulator in the European Union, approved a German state aid scheme for industry worth 2.2 billion euros.The German support scheme is designed to help industrial companies reduce their carbon emissions and support their transition away from fossil fuels towards renewable energy sources.To be eligible to receive German state aid, projects must reduce carbon emissions by at least 40 percent compared to current levels, a statement from the Commission said. Additional conditions require companies to electrify their production process or swap out fossil fuels for renewable hydrogen energy or fuels produced from renewable hydrogen.In the aftermath of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the bloc's competition watchdog loosened usually strict competition rules so EU countries could help businesses with subsidies. The German scheme was approved on this basis.EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said the scheme will also help Germany reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels from Russia.According to the Commission, subsidies may not exceed 200 million euros per recipient and must be granted by December 31, 2025.

EU's Migration Pact: Parliament adopts sweeping asylum reform,"After nearly a decade of negotiations, the EU Parliament has reached an agreement on a reform of its asylum policies, with tougher measures for individuals from countries considered relatively safe. The approval was far from assured, highlighting the significance of the decision.â€œI do hope that we will get it,â€ EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson said Tuesday in an interview ahead of the vote on the asylum reform. â€œThis has been a marathon,â€ she said with regard to getting the package to the voting phase.The EU parliament on Wednesday adopted a sweeping reform of Europeâ€™s asylum policies that will both harden border procedures and force all the blocâ€™s 27 nations to share responsibility.The parliamentâ€™s main political groups overcame opposition from far-right and far-left parties to pass the new migration and asylum pact. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the vote, saying it will â€œsecure European borders (...) while ensuring the protection of the fundamental rightsâ€ of migrants.A political breakthrough came under the Spanish Council Presidency in December when a weighted majority of EU countries backed the reforms, overcoming opposition from Hungary and Poland.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Greeceâ€™s migration minister Dimitris Kairidis both called the reform â€œhistoricâ€. Kairidis said that the Greek government had supported the effort from the very beginning and the decision was historic for â€œthe European unificationâ€, as he told the Athens News Agency.French President Emmanuel Macron said Europe was acting â€œeffectively and humanelyâ€ while Italian Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi hailed what he termed â€œthe best possible compromiseâ€.But there was dissent when Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n derided the reform as â€œanother nail in the coffin of the European Unionâ€.â€œUnity is dead, secure borders are no more. Hungary will never give in to the mass migration frenzy! We need a change in Brussels in order to Stop Migration!â€ OrbÃ¡n said in a post on X.Criticism from NGOsMigrant charities also slammed the pact, which includes building border centres to hold asylum-seekers and sending some to â€œsafeâ€ countries outside the EU.Amnesty International said the EU was â€œshamefullyâ€ backing a deal â€œthey know will lead to greater human sufferingâ€ while the Red Cross federation urged member states â€œto guarantee humane conditions for asylum seekers and migrants affectedâ€.The vote itself was initially disrupted by protesters yelling: â€œThe pact kills, vote no!â€, while dozens of demonstrators outside the parliament building in Brussels held up placards with slogans decrying the reform.The parliamentâ€™s far-left grouping, which maintains that the reforms are incompatible with Europeâ€™s commitment to upholding human rights, said it was a â€œdark dayâ€.It was â€œa pact with the devilâ€, said French MEP Damien Careme, a lawmaker from the Greens group.In January, Elma Saiz, the Spanish Minister for Inclusion, Social Security and Migration defended the migration pact in the face of criticism from several left-wing parties that denounced the loss of rights for migrants. Saiz described the pact as â€œa step forwardâ€ as it will allow greater coordination at the European level and a better integration of migrants in the labour market. Measure to relieve migrant influx in the south Under current EU rules, the country of arrival bears responsibility for hosting and vetting asylum-seekers, and returning those deemed inadmissible, a system that has put southern states under pressure and fuelled far-right opposition.New border centres would hold irregular migrants while their asylum requests are vetted under the new system. And deportations of those deemed inadmissible would be sped up.The reform would require EU countries to take in thousands of asylum-seekers from â€œfrontlineâ€ states such as Italy and Greece. Alternatively, they could provide money or other resources to the under-pressure nations. At least 30,000 asylum-seekers a year will come under this relocation system. An annual financial compensation of 600 million euros ($650 million) would be fixed for those preferring to pay instead of host.The first-entry countries, such as Italy, von der Leyen assured that from now on â€œthey will no longer be aloneâ€ in the face of the challenges posed by immigration. â€œThe pact takes our needs into account,â€ Piantedosi stressed. â€œIt is the best possible compromise. (...) Italy played an important role as did the European Peopleâ€™s Party, EPP,â€ Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani commented. In an interview, a day before the final vote, Commissioner Johansson pointed out that with the new pact also â€œa number of loopholes with regard to secondary movementsâ€ would be closed. It is already planned that, after a two-year transposition period, â€œif a person arrives in Portugal and asks for asylum in Portugal, they have to stay in Portugalâ€, explained Ylva Johansson in response to news agency Lusa. This came at a time when there are fears that the country could be a gateway to the EU for migrants who then want to settle in countries like Germany or France.The package establishes an emergency response in the event of unexpected migration surges, the same sort of crisis the EU faced in 2015-2016 when more than two million asylum-seekers entered the bloc, many of them from war-torn Syria and Afghanistan. Asylum requests stood at 1.14 million in 2023, the highest level since 2016.Tusk vows to â€œprotectâ€ Poland against EU migrant relocationPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk on Wednesday said his government would â€œprotect Poland against the [European Union] relocation mechanismâ€.Polandâ€™s right-wing PiS party, in power until the October 2023 elections, was a fierce critic of the reforms, and the new governing alliance led by Tusk, despite its largely pro-EU views, has maintained that stance.Migration dealsIn parallel with the reform, the EU has reproduced the same sort of deal it struck with Turkey in 2016 to stem migratory flows. The EU has reached accords with Tunisia and, most recently, Egypt that are portrayed as broader cooperation arrangements. Many lawmakers have, however, criticised the deals. Bulgaria, which borders Turkey, has been strongly affected by migrant flows from Turkey. This year it has seen a drop in illegal crossings compared to the same time in 2023, according to the then outgoing Interior Minister Kalin Stoyanov. On March 22, he said that this year there were 5,777 illegal crossings compared to 18,474 the year before. Bulgariaâ€™s Schengen accession was initially vetoed in 2022 by Austria and the Netherlands as it was seen as a transit route for many immigrants to Central and Western Europe.OpponentsMarine Le Pen, the figurehead of Franceâ€™s far-right National Rally, complained the changes would give â€œlegal impunity to NGOs complicit with smugglersâ€.She and her partyâ€™s leader who sits in the European Parliament, Jordan Bardella, said they would seek to overturn the reform after EU elections in June, which are tipped to boost far-right numbers in the legislature.OrbÃ¡nâ€™s government reaffirmed Hungary would not be taking in any asylum-seekers.â€œThis new migration pact practically gives the green light to illegal migration to Europe,â€ Hungaryâ€™s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said before the vote, adding that Budapest â€œwill not allow illegal migrants to set foot here in Hungaryâ€.The Slovak Republic unequivocally rejected the new EU Migration Pact and said it did not agree with the compulsory redistribution of illegal migrants, Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj BlanÃ¡r said after the vote on Wednesday. Czech MEPs have voiced support for some elements of the migration package, while rejecting others. Their stance reflects criticism that the proposals fall short of comprehensive solutions to the migration challenge and lack ambition.

EU condemns Iran's attack on Israel as 'unprecedented escalation',"EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has condemned Iran's attack on Israel last weekend. EU foreign ministers will meet on Tuesday to discuss security in the Middle East region.Brussels (dpa) – On Sunday, the European Union condemned Iran's direct aerial attack on Israel in the ""strongest termsâ€.""This is an unprecedented escalation and a threat to regional security,"" the bloc's chief diplomat Josep Borrell said on behalf of the EU. ""We call on all parties to exercise utmost restraint.""Â In this highly tense regional situation, further escalation can be in no one's interest, Borrell said in a statement. He also reaffirmed the EUâ€™s commitment to Israel's security. ""The EU remains firmly committed to contribute to de-escalation and security in the region and is in close contact with all sides to this end.""Borrell spoke to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian to convey these messages and urged Iran not to escalate further, Borrell wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.He has called an extraordinary meeting of EU foreign ministers for Tuesday to address security in the region.

EU wind farm probe puts Brussels-Beijing relations on edge,"The European Commission has announced investigations into wind farms in several EU member states, fearing unfair competition from Chinese subsidies. Beijing, however, lashed out at the blocâ€™s â€œprotectionistâ€ behaviour â€“ putting pressure on EU-China relations.Last week, the EU announced investigations into Chinese suppliers of wind turbines in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria, the latest move by Brussels targeting the country over green tech subsidies suspected of undermining fair competition.The blocâ€™s competition chief, European Commission Executive Vice-President Margrethe Vestager, announced the inquiry during a speech at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton in the US state of New Jersey.â€œChina is for us simultaneously a partner in fighting climate change, an economic competitor, a systemic rival. And the last two dimensions are increasingly converging,â€ Vestager said in her speech.According to industry lobby group WindEurope, Chinese wind turbines are currently being offered in Europe at prices up to 50 percent lower than European-made ones, at a time when Brussels is seeking a major increase in renewable energy with the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In its renewable energy production, the EU seeks to move away from over-reliance on cheaper Chinese technology.In Spain, for example, the China Three Gorges Group is involved in the sales processes of two major renewable energy projects currently underway in the Spanish market, which together represent around 1,500 MW of green power. In both bids, the group is competing with some of the big names in European electricity, such as Naturgy, Engie and Verbund.On Friday, Chinaâ€™s commerce minister accused the European Commission of pursuing â€œprotectionistâ€ actions at the expense of green initiatives by launching investigations into Chinese subsidies.â€œWe canâ€™t understand how the European Commission on the one hand carries the flag for green sustainable development and on the other hand undertakes protectionist operations,â€ Chinaâ€™s Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao said at an Italy-China economic forum in the city of Verona.Franceâ€™s Le Maire: ""Europe must regain economic powerâ€Fearful of the impact on their own economies, the EU and the United States are keeping a close eye on Beijingâ€™s growing economic advance.â€œOur economies cannot absorb this. It is not only dangerous for our competitiveness. It also jeopardises our economic security. We have seen how one-sided dependencies can be used against us. And this is why Europe, and not only the US, is reacting,â€ Vestager said in New Jersey.The EUâ€™s probe into wind parks comes on the heels of recent criticism from the US over Chinaâ€™s excess industrial capacity. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen recently said that Washington â€œwill not acceptâ€ underpriced Chinese goods flooding the global market.The US is concerned that Beijingâ€™s subsidies are leading to more production capacity than global markets can take in, resulting in a surge of cheap exports in sectors such as solar and electric vehicles and thus stifling the growth of those industries elsewhere.Last week, the Economy Ministers of Germany, France and Italy – the three largest economies in the eurozone – met near Paris for the third trilateral meeting on Europeâ€™s economic power and current challenges to economic security – including from China.â€œEurope must regain economic power, it must regain risk and innovation, and it must regain prosperity,â€ French Minister for the Economy and Finances, Bruno Le Maire, said. â€œNo one can accept that Europeans see their relative prosperity diminished compared to that of Americans.â€ He added that China and the US â€œwill not give Europe any discountsâ€ and stressed that â€œthere is not a second to loseâ€ in defining an EU economic strategy.Electric trains in Bulgaria, solar panels in RomaniaThe new investigations into wind turbines follows earlier EU investigations into Chinese subsidies for solar panels, electric cars and trains, as trade tensions with Beijing escalate. The initiative was launched under new rules in place since last year that aim to prevent foreign subsidies from undermining fair competition within the EU.The EU opened its first probe under the Foreign Subsidies Regulation in February, targeting a subsidiary of Chinese rail giant CRRC, which took part in a tender in Bulgaria to supply electric trains. That investigation was closed after the subsidiary withdrew from the tender.A second probe targets Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers seeking to build and operate a photovoltaic park in Romania, partly financed by EU funds.â€œJust last week, we opened investigations into bids by Chinese companies that may unduly have been advantaged in public tenders for solar panels in Romania,â€ Vestager said in her speech.Under the EUâ€™s Foreign Subsidies Regulation, companies are required to notify their participation in public procurement tenders in the EU when the estimated value of the contract exceeds 250 million Euro and when the company has been awarded foreign financial contributions of at least four million Euro from at least one third country in the three years preceding the notification.The Foreign Subsidy Regulation came into force on July 12, 2023. The rules allow the Commission to tackle the distortions caused by foreign subsidies and therefore enables the EU to ensure a level playing field for all businesses which carry out their activity on the domestic market, while remaining open to trade and investments.Following the preliminary examination of all submissions, the Commission considered that it was justified to initiate an in-depth investigation for two bidders in the Romanian tender, as there were sufficient indications that both had received foreign subsidies distorting the internal market.An electric vehicle is charging at a charging station. Photo: Eduardo Parra / Europa Press (ARCHIVE photo)Ongoing electric vehicle stand-offIn her speech in Princeton, Vestager also referred to the EUâ€™s long-standing concerns about unfair competition from Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.â€œIn October last year, the European Commission launched an anti-subsidy investigation into the import of electrical vehicles from China. If we determine that those electrical cars have been illegally subsidised, we will impose remedies,â€ Vestager said.According to the Commission, Chinese electric cars are normally around 20 percent cheaper than models built in the EU. The anti-subsidy investigation could now lead to punitive tariffs being imposed.Last week, German car manufacturers said they are against possible European punitive tariffs on the import of electric cars from China. The German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) called for a willingness to engage in dialogue on both sides to avoid harming the sectorâ€™s development.â€œAnti-subsidy measures, such as additional tariffs, would not solve the challenges for the European and German automotive industry. On the contrary: the purpose of countervailing duties envisaged by the European Commission could quickly have a negative impact in the event of a trade conflict,â€ VDA president Hildegard MÃ¼ller told the Sunday edition of the German newspaper Die Welt.According to Germanyâ€™s Center Automotive Research, German car manufacturers sell 30Â­ to 40 percent of their output on the Chinese market. In the event of European punitive tariffs, these manufacturers could therefore be the first target of possible Chinese countermeasures.A preliminary announcement by the Commission is planned by June 5, the newspaper reported.This article is published weekly.

German interior minister praises Romania's efforts on EU asylum cooperation,"German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser met with her Romanian counterpart to discuss the countries' cooperation on migration and asylum. As part of efforts to fully join the borderless Schengen zone, Bulgaria and Romania have recently made progress in protecting the EU's external borders.Berlin/Bucharest (dpa) – German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has praised Romania's efforts toward European solidarity on asylum issues as part of its bid to fully join the Schengen zone, Europe's free movement area.""I would like to express my gratitude for the good cooperation in this area,"" the minister said after talks with her Romanian counterpart, Interior Minister CÄƒtÄƒlin Predoiu, in Bucharest on Tuesday.Germany is supporting Romania and Bulgaria, where Faeser visited the border with Turkey on Monday, in their endeavours to fully join the Schengen zone.Since March 31, both EU member states have removed air and sea border controls. However, Austria has so far prevented the introduction of Schengen rules at land borders with its veto. Predoiu said he hopes that this issue can be resolved this year.Bulgaria and Romania's recent progress in protecting the EU's external borders is said to have already led to smuggling gangs increasingly looking for alternative routes and them now demanding more money for smuggling people through one of the two countries. The increasing number of arrivals of smugglers' boats on Cyprus and Crete is currently a cause for concern for the interior ministers of the EU member states.Additional refugee movements are to be expected, particularly in view of the escalation in the Middle East and the economic crisis in Egypt and Lebanon. According to the UN Refugee Agency, the asylum seekers who arrived in Italy in the first two months of this year came from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt.According to the European border protection agency Frontex, just under 5,500 unauthorised arrivals were detected on the so-called Western Balkans route in the first three months of this year, 64% fewer than in the same period last year.

Survey: Brexit is hampering business for German companies in Britain,"The volume of British-German trade has fallen significantly after Brexit, according to a survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany. The United Kingdom left the European Union in 2020, which had a negative impact on bilateral trade with the bloc.London (dpa) – Brexit and its consequences continue to put a strain on German trade relations with Britain.""Increased administrative costs, logistics costs and customs duties are proving to be ongoingly painful,"" according to a survey by the British Chamber of Commerce in Germany (BCCG) and the auditing firm KPMG, which was made available to dpa in London.New regulations have led to an increasing decoupling of Britain from the European Union. The results were presented on Thursday as part of the Ludwig Erhard Summit in the Bavarian town of Tegernsee.""The decline in the volume of German-British trade is dramatic,"" said KPMG division head Andreas Glunz. Since the Brexit referendum in 2016, the trade volume has fallen from 38 million tons to 22 million tons.British exports to Germany rose again in 2022 for the first time since Brexit. However, this was mainly due to peak prices for crude oil and gas, which replaced the loss of supplies from Russia.The British government wants to declare hundreds of laws from its period of EU membership, which spanned nearly five decades, invalid. BCCG President Michael Schmidt also warned against further decoupling in light of geopolitical crises.""We urgently need to bring the politics and economies of both countries closer together again and build bridges,"" said Schmidt.Britain left the EU at the end of January 2020 and has no longer been a member of the EU customs union and single market since 2021. Despite a last-minute trade agreement, there have been major problems in the bilateral exchange of goods with the EU, especially at the beginning. (18 April)",1
"Study says Germany, EU risk missing their own clean hydrogen goals","According to a study by PwC Strategy&, the EU is far from meeting its own 2030 clean hydrogen targets. The report also said that Germany is not on track with its plans.Munich (dpa) – Clean hydrogen as an energy source is indispensable for achieving global climate targets, but Germany and the European Union are in danger of missing their own hydrogen targets, according to a study published on Monday.""Germany is clearly lagging behind its plans,"" management consulting company PwC Strategy& wrote in its report. While an electrolysis capacity of 10 gigawatts (GW) is planned by 2030, not even 0.1 GW is in operation today and projects with 0.55 GW have been financed, the study showed.Electrolysis is the process by which water is split into hydrogen and oxygen with the help of electricity. The process takes place in an electrolyser and produces carbon-free hydrogen energy.In order to reach its target, Germany would have to build 1 to 2 GW of electrolysis plants and 200 to 400 wind turbines every year. In the past two years, however, only 0.25 GW of additional capacity has been financed.According to PwC, the EU wants to use at least 20 million tons of clean hydrogen by 2030 and produce half of it in Europe. However, ""the EU is a long way from achieving this,"" the report said. It would have to build 120 GW of capacity to achieve this.Only 0.2 GW of plants are currently in operation, while plants with a capacity of 3 GW are under construction or financed. In view of its own targets, the EU would have to build plants with a capacity of 20 GW every year. (22 April)",1
Council of Europe slams UK asylum pact with Rwanda,"The United Kingdomâ€™s House of Lords has approved a bill to establish a controversial asylum pact with Rwanda. The Council of Europe â€“ a human rights body independent of the EU â€“ has strongly criticised the bill.Brussels/Strasbourg (dpa) – The Council of Europe, a European rights body, has sharply criticised the United Kingdom for its controversial asylum pact with the central/eastern African country Rwanda.""The United Kingdom government should refrain from removing people under the Rwanda policy and reverse the Bill's effective infringement of judicial independence,"" said the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, Michael O'Flaherty, in Strasbourg on Tuesday. The law raises questions about the human rights of asylum seekers and the rule of law in general, he said.The Council of Europe is independent of the European Union and was founded in 1949 to protect democracy, human rights and the rule of law in Europe.The British bill, which was approved by the House of Lords (the upper house of the United Kingdomâ€™s parliament) on the night from Monday to Tuesday after lengthy opposition, declares Rwanda a safe third country by law. In doing so, the government wants to prevent appeals against deportations before British courts.The asylum pact with Rwanda stipulates that irregular migrants will no longer be given the opportunity to apply for asylum in the UK. Instead, they are to be taken to Rwanda and apply for asylum there.The regulation is intended to deter people from making the dangerous crossing across the English Channel in small boats. However, opponents doubt that the law will deter migrants.""Managing asylum and migration is undoubtedly a complex endeavour for states, but it must always be done in full compliance with international standards,"" O'Flaherty said.The British law ""is another representation of an ongoing trend towards externalisation of asylum and migration policy in Europe, which is a matter of concern for the global system of protection of the rights of refugees,"" he said.In 2022, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which is part of the Council of Europe, prevented the UK from sending asylum seekers of different nationalities by plane to Rwanda.

EU pushing for new sanctions against Iran,"On Monday, EU foreign and defence affairs ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss assistance for Ukraine and further sanctions on Iran in light of both its recent strike on Israel and its support of Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine. EU foreign and defence ministers discussed support for Ukraine – following US lawmakersâ€™ approval of a nearly 61 billion-dollar aid package – as well as sanctions against Iran for its attack on Israel and its arming of Russia.The ministers instructed EU High Representative For Foreign Affairs and Security Josep Borrell to submit concrete proposals for sanctions. These should make it possible to impose further trade restrictions on Iran in order to make it more difficult for the country to build and develop drones and missiles. There are also plans to impose sanctions on individuals, organisations and companies.â€œWe have reached a political agreement in order to enlarge and expand the existing drones [sanctions] regime to cover missiles and their potential transfer to Russia,â€ reported Borrell.He added that the sanctions will include production and will expand to shipments of drones and missiles not only to Russia, but also to the entire Middle East and the Red Sea region. The ministers also agreed to expand the list of drone components that member states are prohibited from exporting to Iran. An initial political agreement in principle for new Iran sanctions had already been reached last week following the recent escalation of the conflict between Israel and Iran. The heads of state and government at the EU Council summit had subsequently declared that â€œthe European Union will take further restrictive measures against Iran, in particular with regard to drones and missilesâ€. Iran has supplied Russia with drones.On the margins of the summit, Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob stressed that â€œthe only way to reach peace is for all of us to start to realise our responsibility together. This is the position we will continue to defend, not only in the Middle East, but also with regard to Ukraine and Russiaâ€.On April 23, the Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian condemned planned sanctions against his country for the large-scale attack on Israel as â€œunlawfulâ€ and â€œregrettableâ€. Iran had exercised its right to self-defence with the attack, Amir-Abdollahian wrote on X. He called for sanctions against Israel instead.Heightened tensions – what happened?The region has been plunged into turmoil since October 7, when Hamas militants launched an attack that led to the deaths of 1,170 people in southern Israel, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally based on Israeli official figures.Israelâ€™s retaliatory offensive has killed at least 34,012 people in Gaza, mostly women and children, the territoryâ€™s health ministry said on April 19.World leaders, politicians, NGOs and civilians have been calling for a ceasefire for months. Lebanonâ€™s powerful Iran-backed Hezbollah movement has engaged in near-daily exchanges of fire with Israel since the war started. There has also been a surge in violence involving Tehran-aligned groups in Iraq, Yemen and Syria.At the end of December, South Africa took Israel to the International Court of Justice, accusing it of violating the Genocide Convention during the ongoing Gaza war. In an interim ruling, the UN court ordered Israel to take protective measures to prevent genocide. The spectre of a regional war has only been accentuated in the past week following Iranâ€™s first-ever direct attack on Israel on April 13–14 in retaliation for a deadly air strike on Tehranâ€™s consulate building in Syriaâ€™s capital Damascus on April 1, that was widely blamed on Israel. Two generals and five other members of Iranâ€™s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the Islamic Republicâ€™s ideological army, were among those killed.Israel has said Iran launched â€œover 350 threats, ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, rockets and suicide dronesâ€. Nearly all the missiles and drones were intercepted by Israel and others, including the United States, Britain and France.Amidst these heightened tensions, some countries have set up processes to extract their countriesâ€™ citizens from Israel and the broader Middle East region if necessary, for example North Macedonia. Early on April 19, explosions were reported in central Iran, with senior US officials quoted in the press as saying that Israel was retaliating.Israelâ€™s ambassador to the United Nations on April 14, Gilad Erdan, urged the Security Council to designate the Revolutionary Guards as a â€œterroristâ€ organisation and to â€œimpose all possible sanctions on Iran before itâ€™s too lateâ€. Iranâ€™s envoy to the UN said Tehran had â€œno choiceâ€ but to respond to the April 1 attack.Iran, Tehran: Missiles are transported on lorries during the Army Day parade at a military base in northern Tehran. ARCHIVE 17.04.2024 Photo: Vahid Salemi/AP/dpa Calls for Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps to be put on EUâ€™s terror listAt the Monday meeting, the possibility of including the IRGC – a branch of the Iranian armed forces – to the EUâ€™s list of terror organisations was also a point of discussion.The Austrian Federal Minister for European and International Affairs, Alexander Schallenberg, was in favour â€œif it is possibleâ€. Although, he said it is something that â€œde factoâ€ the EU â€œalready doesâ€ because it has individually sanctioned several of its members.Designating the branch of the Iranian armed forces as a terrorist organisation is challenging. The IRGC would first have to be prosecuted by a national authority for terrorist activities under EU law to prompt this sanction.A recent court ruling in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, concerning the activities of the IRGC, is being examined by EU officials. This could open the way to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organisation.The Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister Hadja Lahbib stated that she supported the extension of sanctions against the Revolutionary Guards.Lithuanian minister Gabrielius Landsbergis said he was in favour of restricting the military industry of a country that â€œis fighting on two frontsâ€. â€œHow many fronts does Iran need to open for us to get serious about sanctioning them?â€ he asked, noting the Islamist regimeâ€™s involvement in Ukraine and its attack on Israel.In Sweden, the parliament formally decided last year to order the government to push for putting the IRGC on the EUâ€™s list of terror organisations.

ARCHIVE 04.10.2022,  Photo: Ilia Yefimovich/dpa Review of further EU sanctions against violent Israeli settlersEU chief diplomat Borrell stated on Monday that the EU will once again address the sanctions against Israeli settlers responsible for violence against Palestinians in the West Bank.On Friday, the European Union imposed sanctions on four Israeli settlers and two groups of â€œextremistâ€ Israeli militants for violence committed against Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem.â€œAttacks against Palestinians are also increasing in the West Bank. We will have to look again at sanctions against violent settlers. Last week we approved a small package of measures,â€ Borrell told the press upon his arrival at the Council of EU Foreign and Defense Ministers.While Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib supported evaluating more sanctions against Israeli settlers, she considered it insufficient, asking to go further and also sanctioning those arming and defending violent settlers. â€œThe whole system has to be affected,â€ she said.Stalled Israel-Palestine ceasefire talks, but â€œhope not lostâ€Regarding the situation in Gaza, Borrell after the Monday meeting said that â€œthere is no progress on the release of hostages, there is no prospect for a ceasefire, and there is no real easing of the humanitarian catastropheâ€œ.Borrell said that European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez Lenarcic, had provided â€œsome examples of how humanitarian support is being obstructedâ€, even though the EU is calling for â€œunhindered accessâ€.â€œThe humanitarian catastrophe for the Palestinian people continues. I want to insist that there will be no lasting stability in the region as long as the war in Gaza continues,â€ Borrell stressed.The EU chief diplomat further said that ministers agreed to invite the Israeli foreign minister as well as the new Palestinian Prime Minister to the upcoming Foreign Affairs Council.The Qatari Prime Minister, Sheikh Mohamed bin Abdelrahman bin Jassim Al Thani, whose country is an important mediator in trying to reach a ceasefire in the Gaza war, said on Monday at the first ever high-level EU-Gulf Cooperation Council security forum that he has not lost hope of achieving that despite negotiations with Israel and Hamas not yet having produced results.This article is published weekly.

European Parliament calls for stricter air pollution limits,"In their last plenary session in Strasbourg before the EU elections, MEPs approved a provisional agreement reached in February to tighten rules on air pollution. According to the European Environment Agency, poor air quality is a major health risk.Strasbourg (dpa) – The European Parliament gave the green light on Wednesday for stricter limits on air pollution. Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) voted in the French city of Strasbourg in favour of new upper limits to apply for emissions like particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulphur dioxide (SO2), among other pollutants.Representatives of the EU member states and the European Parliament had reached a provisional agreement in February.The new rules are intended to ensure that air pollution in Europe does not harm human health, the parliament said.In future, citizens should be entitled to compensation if they fall ill due to non-compliance with limit values.The limit values for certain particulate matter and sulphur dioxide are to be halved.""By updating air quality standards, some of which were established nearly two decades ago, pollution will be halved across the EU, paving the way for a healthier, more sustainable future,"" said Socialist MEP Javi LÃ³pez, who was responsible for the file in the European Parliament.Following the vote in the plenary session of the European Parliament, the EU member states still have to confirm the new rules. This is usually a formality and is scheduled for next week.According to the European Environment Agency (EEA), poor air quality remains the greatest health risk as a result of environmental conditions.According to the latest figures, there were some 253,000 deaths in the EU in 2021 related to particulate matter levels above the recommended limits of the World Health Organization (WHO).The German Association of Cities is calling for polluters to be held more accountable. They support the goal of reducing pollutants in the air, Managing Director Helmut Dedy told dpa. ""However, this will only succeed if pollutants are also stopped directly at source,"" Dedy said. ""Industry, car manufacturers, the energy sector and agriculture are the main contributors to air pollution.""",1
"Interview with Renew’s lead candidate Valérie Hayer: No coalition with right-wing parties
","On Tuesday, April 23, the European Newsroom spoke in StraÃŸbourg to ValÃ©rie Hayer, leader of the liberal group Renew, about the upcoming European elections, the geopolitical situation of Europe and the EU Enlargement in the Western Balkans. In an interview with the European Newsroom, conducted by EFE, ValÃ©rie Hayer, leader of the liberal group Renew, firmly ruled out a future coalition with right-wing parties in the European Parliament.Â Hayer emphasised Renew's commitment to upholding liberal values and expressed concern about the rise of far-right ideologies in European politics.With the upcoming European Parliament elections in June, Hayer urged voters to be wary of the far-right's agenda, highlighting the potential consequences for European unity and progress.Looking to the future, Hayer stressed the importance of strategic autonomy for Europe and argued for less dependence on external powers and a greater focus on climate initiatives.With regard to EU enlargement, Hayer emphasised the need for performance-based accession and internal EU reforms to make enlargement effective.The interview was followed online by several enr news agencies, among them AMNA, ANSA, BTA, HINA and STA. A number of enr agencies published the interviews in their respective wires. ",1
ValÃ©rie Hayer: European liberal leader rules out coalition with parties to the right of the EPP,"The leader of the liberal group Renew, ValÃ©rie Hayer, is ready to continue the current coalition with the Peopleâ€™s Party and the S&D. However, a coalition with the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) is out of the question, she told the European Newsroom. The head of the European Liberalsâ€™ list for the elections to the European Parliament next June, ValÃ©rie Hayer, ruled out a future European coalition that includes the Conservative parties and Reformists (ECR), among them Giorgia Meloniâ€™s Fratelli dâ€™Italia and the Spanish right wing party Vox.Â In an interview with the European Newsroom on Wednesday, Hayer insisted that for her group it is unthinkable to sit at the negotiating table with ECR, which she called extreme right in its entirety. In that assessment she included Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni personally.Hayer stands at the forefront of the call for the right to abortion to be included in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. She challenges in particular the approval of the Italian Parliament to authorise militant anti-abortion associations to intervene in abortion clinics to convince women not to have abortions. â€œThe Italian Parliament has adopted an amendment that allows anti-abortion militants to intervene in clinics that perform abortions to discourage women from having an abortion. A coalition agreement with the ECR, which includes the Fratelli d'Italia, which includes (tomorrow) Eric Zemmour's ReconquÃªte, (...), is therefore out of the question,â€ the liberal candidate said about future coalition arrangements in the EP.â€œI am very confident about Renewâ€™s position in the next European Parliament,â€ the 38-year-old French politician, a close associate of President Emmanuel Macron, said.Shift to the right in European elections?Hayer, who also chairs the Renew group in the European Parliament, warned that the ultra-conservatives and the extreme right will be able to add enough seats to form a blocking minority with their foreseeable gains at the polls on June 9.â€œI say to voters throughout Europe: beware of the temptation of the far right, because the far right wants to unravel Europe, to undo the European project. It would mean withdrawal, loss of competitiveness, loss of jobs. It would have meant, under the mandate we passed, probably no recovery plan that benefited all our businesses and all our citizens throughout Europe,â€ Hayer said.Asked if she extends this warning to her counterpart in the European Peopleâ€™s Party in the European Parliament, , after the occasions in which the EPP has sought support on its right to counteract a more progressive majority, Hayer said that she has â€œconfidenceâ€ in the will of the European People's Party to continue working towards a pro-European coalition. This has been expressed to Weber himself.â€œIt is in our DNA to fight against extremes,â€ stressed the French politician, who said she trusted that the Renew Europe group will continue to be useful in achieving majorities in the next legislature. She warned that Renew will not sign any â€˜blank chequesâ€™ with regard to support for the future nominee to head the European Commission.The groupâ€™s objective after the elections, she said, will be â€œto return to European Parliament in the largest possible numbers to maximise the influenceâ€ of the formation and ensure that the work program of the future Commission focuses on its priorities: improving the strategic autonomy of the European Commission, defend competitiveness and support liberal democratic values.Europe needs â€˜strategic autonomyâ€™â€œThe geopolitical risk, the risk of Trumpâ€™s return (to the White House) is a reality. We need to give ourselves the means to decide for ourselves, as Europeans at the level of the European Union, to build this strategic autonomy so that we are no longer dependent on other powers. As we have seen with our energy supply, we were dependent on Russia. We are no longer dependent on Russia. [It means] no longer depending on Asia for our battery supplies, and no longer depending on the United States for our common defence,â€ Hayer stressed.Another of the challenges of the next legislature will be, for Hayer, to build the next phase of the European Green Deal after having focused the last five years on the design of it. â€œNow we have to implement this legislation. Making sure that no one is left behind, which means supporting and giving opportunities to our businesses,â€ she explained.â€œWe are simplifying and speeding up processes, making life easier for companies that want to develop wind or photovoltaic energy projects, or electric batteries. We must implement and create the regulatory and financial conditions so that the environmental transition becomes a reality and we achieve climate neutrality by 2050 in all sectors,â€ she said.EU enlargement in the Western BalkansSpeaking about EU enlargement, Hayer said that there has been a lot of progress in that area recently because of the situation in Ukraine.She pointed out that the rule on which the process of accession to the Union is based on merit applies to both Ukraine and the Western Balkans. It is also important for the EU to implement reforms so that it can function after enlargement.â€œWe Europeans ourselves must undertake reforms if we are to be more effective in our decision-making processes,â€ said the French politician.She warned that the presence and influence of Russia and China can be seen in the Western Balkans, and that expansion is also a â€œgeopolitical toolâ€.Alongside Hayer, the leading liberal candidates are Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann from Germany and Sandro Gozi from Italy. The liberal Renew faction in the European Parliament actually consists of three parties: the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats in Europe (ALDE), the French Renaissance of President Emmanuel Macron and the EDP (â€œEuropean Democratic Partyâ€), to which the Free Voters also belong.

Reaching young EU voters through social media,"Social media is one of the most popular places for young people to be socially and politically active, and politicians are increasingly exploring ways to engage with young voters online ahead of the EU elections.The Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is growing in popularity among the younger generation and is becoming a factor in the upcoming European elections, politicians and experts say ahead of the EU elections – despite ongoing privacy and security concerns at the EU level.Young voters are more likely than the average population to find information on social media, claimed digital expert Ingrid Brodnig and Markus Zimmer, CEO of the Austrian social media market research agency BuzzValue, in an interview with the Austrian Press Agency APA at the end of last year.MEPs are now also trying to get on TikTok in order to reach young voters. The German Greens, for example, plan to reach out to younger voters through TikTok in their campaign for the European Parliament elections in June.The Green Party's top candidate for the European elections, Terry Reintke, said the move was intended to show how important young and first-time voters were to the party, whose main focus has traditionally been on environmental issues.While there had been concerns over using TikTok for campaigning, the Greens did not want to ""leave this space to the far-right"", said party managing director Emily BÃ¼ning.Last year, the European Commission and the European Parliament banned their staff from using TikTok on their work mobile phones for security reasons. TikTok has long been accused of inadequate data security and a lack of protection for young users. Terry Reintke (l), German and European lead candidate for the Greens in the European elections presents the Greens' campaign with party co-leaders Omid Nouripour and Ricarda Lang and party Managing Director Emily BÃ¼ning.  Photo: Kay Nietfeld/dpaâ€œDo what countsâ€In the European elections, Germany's Greens are campaigning under the slogan ""Do what counts.""The party's focus would be on the future of the European Union's Green Deal, aimed at making the bloc carbon-neutral by 2050, Reintke said. She accused conservative and far-right forces of ""taking an axe to the Green Deal.""German Greens co-leader Omid Nouripour said the party would focus on three themes, ""peace and security, prosperity and safeguarding the climate, and democracy and freedom.""The party also plans to put up posters across Germany with slogans promoting democracy and freedom to counter the ""massive shift to the right"" it expects to see in the elections.Opinion polls for the European elections in Germany put the Greens at between 11 percent and 16 percent, well short of the 20.5 percent they secured in the 2019 European elections, their best result to date.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Gen Z going to the EU ballots.

The big challenge: mobilising young people for the European elections,"In an interview with the Spanish news agency EFE in February, Jaume Duch Guillot, Director-General of Communication and spokesperson for the European Parliament, talked about the importance of getting young people to vote in the 2024 EU elections and the challenges of getting them to go to the ballot box.In the June elections, young people have ""a lot of responsibility"" and ""they are the ones who should have the most interest"" in the result because ""what is going to happen in the next five or ten years is going to affect them a lot, more than anyone"", said the European Parliament's Director-General for Communication and spokesperson, Jaume Duch Guillot, in an interview with EFE in February.""They feel European, they are European, they live in a European environment, but that does not mean that they have achieved this forever and that this cannot go backwards if they are not taken care of,"" said Duch, who hopes to mobilise young Europeans a few weeks before the elections with the help of celebrities whom they admire in entertainment or sports.Mobilising young people to go to the polls from June 6 to 9 is crucial, and even more so at a time when the double phenomenon of Russian interference and Euroxenophobic movements overlap. ""Practically every day we see campaigns, sometimes more or less organised, sometimes more or less large, of disinformation in relation to the European electionsâ€, noted Duch.Â He added that ""Russia has been promoting and in some cases even financing anti-European movements for many years, clearly not only Eurosceptic movements, but I would even say Euroxenophobic movements.""This phenomenon ""is very harmful. And fighting against it is a very complicated undertaking"", he said, adding that the fight requires ""a lot of coordination and making an effort to mobilise political forces and the entire society.â€According to a Eurobarometer survey commissioned by the European Parliament in June 2019, the record participation in the last European elections in May 2019 (50.66 percent for the EU as a whole) was driven by youth: the largest increase in participation was recorded in the age groups under 25 and between 25 and 39.Across the EU, participation among the under-25s increased by 14 percentage points to 42 per cent and among the 25-39s by 12 points to 47 per cent.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Gen Z going to the EU ballots.

"Gen Zers can vote in EU elections for the first time – but will they?
","The clock in the countdown to the 2024 European Parliament elections is ticking. Millions of young EU citizens will be eligible to vote. New data shows the likelihood of them actually going to the polls â€“ and what issues they care about most. Data published by the European Union's statistical office, Eurostat, on 4 April shows that millions of young EU citizens will be able to vote for the first time in June's European Parliament elections. Across the bloc, more than 400 million people are eligible to cast their vote in the 10th parliamentary election since the first direct elections in 1979. In the first post-Brexit European elections, the number of elected Members of Parliament (MEPs) is set to increase from 705 to 720. According to the available data, the highest numbers of first-time voters are expected in Germany (5.1 million), France (4 million) and Italy (2.8 million). The lowest numbers are expected in Malta (20.000), Cyprus (3.000) and Estonia (70.000).On April 17, the European Parliament published its 2024 Spring Eurobarometer survey, the last before the EU elections in June. Among other things, the survey evaluated how interested EU citizens are in the elections, how likely they are to vote and which issues they consider important in the run-up to the elections. A total of 26,411 EU citizens aged 15 and over were interviewed across the 27 EU member states. Looking at young people, the data for 15-24 year-olds shows how voters in Generation Z view the upcoming elections.Presentation of the final Eurobarometer survey data of public opinion before the 2024 EU elections. Photo: Emilie GOMEZ/Â© European Union 2024 - Source : EPSpring Eurobarometer: priorities and likelihood to voteAccording to the survey data, 51 percent of respondents aged 15 to 24 said they were interested in these elections, compared to an average of 60 percent of all EU citizens. 48 percent of respondents in this age group said they considered it highly important to vote in the EU elections, a slightly lower result compared to the average of 53 percent of all EU citizens. At the time of the survey, when asked how likely they would be to vote in the EU elections, 63 percent of respondents in the 15-24 age group said they would be likely to vote if the elections were to be held a week later. 71 percent of all EU citizens said they would do the same. For comparison, the overall turnout for the 2019 elections was 50.66%.The survey also highlighted citizensâ€™ priorities ahead of the EU elections. For young voters aged 15-24, the three most important topics that should be discussed as a matter of priority during the election campaign were action against climate change (33 percent), the fight against poverty and social exclusion (31 percent) as well as support for the economy and the creation of new jobs (29 percent).When asked which values the European Parliament should defend in the next five years, respondents in the 15-24 age group highlighted peace (42 percent), the protection of human rights in the EU and worldwide (28 percent) and democracy (27 percent). Asked whether they agree that voting is important to ensure a better future for the next generations, the youngest respondents scored higher than those in other age groups, with 86 percent of them agreeing compared to 84 percent of all EU citizens. A large majority of 15-24 year olds also agreed that voting is important to keep democracy strong (86 percent) and that the current international context makes voting even more important (83 percent).How young are the youngest voters?EU-wide, voters under the age of 18 will be able to cast their ballot in June in five countries: in Austria, Belgium, Germany and Malta from the age of 16 and in Greece from the age of 17.The extension of voting rights to 16 and 17 year olds is in line with a long-standing demand from youth organisations. In its own campaign in the context of the upcoming European elections, the Brussels-based European Youth Forum – a platform of youth organisations in Europe – has called for a general lowering of the minimum voting age to 16 for all local, regional, national and European elections. The organisation argues that young people are already underrepresented in the European Parliament. According to the organisation, the average age of MEPs is 50, but only six out of 705 MEPs are under 30.In the 2019 European elections, 42 percent of under 25-year-olds across the EU voted. While this was a significant increase in turnout for this age group compared to 2014, it was still lower than the total voter turnout of 50.66 percent.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Gen Z going to the EU ballots.

EUÂ Commission to provide another â‚¬68m in aid for Palestinians in Gaza,"This brings the total amount of EU aid for Palestinians in Gaza and the wider region to â‚¬193 million since the beginning of the year. The EU is also involved in airdropping supplies. Brussels (dpa) - The European Union is releasing another â‚¬68 million in humanitarian aid for Palestinians affected by the ongoing war in Gaza, the European Commission said in Brussels onÂ Friday.""In light of the continued deterioration of the severe humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and the steady rise of needs on the ground, the Commission is stepping up its funding to support Palestinians affected by the ongoing war,""Â the EU's executive said in a press release.The additional sum is intended to ""scale up the desperately needed food assistance, nutritional, health, water and sanitation and shelter support, amongst others.""This brings the total amount of EU aid for Palestinians in Gaza and the wider region to â‚¬193 million since the beginning of the year.Besides financial aid, the EU is also involved in airdropping supplies provided by member states and allies into the sealed-off coastal region.The Commission says it has further funded the transport of more than 130 tonnes of shelter, health, water and sanitation supplies donated by Ireland and humanitarian partners.Gaza has been under constant Israeli bombardment since the October 7 attacks, when militants led by Palestinian extremist organization Hamas killed some 1,200 people in Israel.Almost 35,000 Palestinians have been killed since the outbreak of the war.

States seek renewed EU action against Russian disinformation,"On Monday, the German European Affairs Minister, France's Deputy Minister for European Affairs and Poland's Foreign Minister met, declaring they would not tolerate any attempts to interfere in democratic processes. They also raised the idea of an European media platform. Paris (dpa) - Germany, France and Poland want to step up the fight against Russian attempts at disinformation in the run-up to the European elections in June.Russia's disinformation campaign is intended to undermine democracy and cast the European Union in a bad light, the three countries say.At a meeting near Paris on Monday, German European Affairs Minister Anna LÃ¼hrmann, France's Deputy Minister for European Affairs Jean-NoÃ«l Barrot and Poland's Foreign Minister Adam Szlapka declared that they would not tolerate any attempts to interfere in democratic processes.The three countries are campaigning at the EU level for large online platforms and search engines to take faster and more efficient action against new disinformation campaigns that are uncovered by national authorities.""I believe it is crucial that we take more decisive action against disinformation,"" said LÃ¼hrmann at the meeting of the representatives of the so-called Weimar Triangle countries. ""It is important that our democracy is resilient and that we do not act naively when confronting an actor who already has many means at his disposal.""She said that if the EU wants to protect democracy, it must take action against concrete disinformation and exchange information on protective measures, but also invest in prevention. ""We need to strengthen media literacy and the critical handling of information in our societies and make it easier for citizens to access credible information that they can trust.""The three countries also raised the idea of a European media platform comparable to the French-German TV channel ARTE, which could contribute to the fight against disinformation and provide high-quality information for all EU citizens. ""We believe it is important to discuss a European media platform that would enable citizens to access media content more jointly in a pan-European context,"" LÃ¼hrmann said. (April 29)",1
20 years of the EU's Eastern Enlargement,"Two decades of EU membership are a reason to celebrate. On May 1, 2004, ten Eastern European states joined the bloc â€“ the EUâ€™s biggest enlargement to date. However, amidst the festivities, attention turns to regions like the Western Balkans, who are still on the waiting list for EU accession.On the 20th anniversary of their accession to the European Union, the Eastern European states celebrated their EU membership. On May 1, 2004, ten countries joined the EU: Czechia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Cyprus and Malta.Poland found its place on May 1, 2004, said Foreign Minister RadosÅ‚aw Sikorski on Wednesday at a meeting with his German colleague Annalena Baerbock in the German-Polish sister cities Frankfurt (Oder) and Slubice: â€œAmong friends, among allies, in Europe, at home. This is what generations of Poles have fought for.â€ Baerbock emphasised that the entire European Union had benefited from the enlargement to include the former Eastern Bloc countries.Baerbock added that European integration â€œdoes not fall from the skyâ€, but rather needs strong and courageous responsibility. According to her, because of the ongoing war in Ukraine the continent â€œcannot afford grey areas in Europeâ€. â€œThe EU must be reformed to be stronger in security policy, to speak with one voice, and at the same time accept those countries that also want to become part of this union of freedom and security,â€ she said.Â Annalena Baerbock (Alliance 90/The Greens), Federal Foreign Minister, and Radoslaw Sikorski, Foreign Minister of Poland, take part in a press conference on the 20th anniversary of Poland's accession to the EU. Photo: Patrick Pleul/dpaA joint statement by the presidents of the Baltic states on Wednesday read: â€œWe have experienced tremendous economic growth, stability and security, while at the same time representing a remarkable success story of European integration and transformation."" The heads of state Alar Karis (Estonia), Edgars RinkÄ“viÄs (Latvia) and Gitanas NausÄ—da (Lithuania) went on to write: â€œThe inscription â€˜European Unionâ€™ appeared on the passports of our citizens, marking a triumphant return to our rightful historical place as members of the European family.â€On Tuesday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier celebrated the historic anniversary together with Czech President Petr Pavel in Prague. Both heads of state spoke out in favour of admitting further candidate countries to the European Union. â€œIf we leave the Western Balkan states, Ukraine, Moldova and Georgia at the door for too long, we will hand them over to players like Russia, who do not mean well by Europeans and Europe at all,â€ warned Pavel. Steinmeier also said: â€œThe states of the Western Balkans, Ukraine and Moldova belong to a free Europe and to our Union.â€Charles Michel: Enlargement a geopolitical imperativeThe European Union and the candidate countries must be ready for enlargement by 2030, said the President of the European Council, Charles Michel on Monday at the ceremony to mark the 20th anniversary of EU enlargement in 2004. He added that the next wave of EU enlargement represents a geopolitical imperative and â€œa date with historyâ€. He emphasised that enlargement is the cornerstone of the EU's strategic sovereignty.Â â€œCandidate countries and EU Institutions have a lot of work to do. I repeat my firm belief that we must be ready to enlarge, on both sides, by 2030,â€ Michel said. He explained that for the candidates this means implementing the necessary reforms and resolving all bilateral disputes, and for the EU reforming the program and budget and the decision-making process. â€œWe are working hard with the 27 member states to prepare the strategic agenda. It will serve as a foundation for the next five years.â€Necessary reformsIn this sense, the Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib and the European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency, VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, advocated promoting decisions by qualified majority instead of unanimity in the areas of Defense and Foreign Affairs. They were â€œabsolutely existentialâ€, in the words of JourovÃ¡, who anticipated that the right of veto will be one of the central topics of the discussions on enlargement.Â Others, she said, will be the future of Article 7 – the procedure that allows a member countryâ€™s rights of membership to be suspended due to problems with the rule of law, open until now to Hungary and Poland – as well as the budget, given that it will be necessary for countries have the capacity to absorb European funds.  â€œThe EU is above all a union of values, not an ATM,â€ Lahbib said, adding that the EU must energise its single market and reform its decision-making processes to react more agilely and â€œsolve the problem of sometimes abusive vetoesâ€.At a meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels on Tuesday, the representatives of all the ten candidate countries for accession were included for the first time –- Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, Kosovo, Turkey and Ukraine. JourovÃ¡ also highlighted at that conference that this was â€œa good rehearsalâ€ of what it would be like to debate with 37 members.Turkey became an EU candidate in 1999 – and has probably never been further away from membership than it is today. Theoretically, a candidate country can never become a member.Member states currently have differing priorities regarding the accession – with the war in Ukraine being one significant factor: A number of Danish MEPs for example, from the Greens in SF to ruling party Venstre expressed support for EU expansion to 30 countries or more. Morten LÃ¸kkegaard, the leading candidate for the governing party Venstre said he would like Ukraine, Moldova and North Macedonia to be the first to join the EU. He warned of a potential Russian influence post-Ukraine conflict and said he was opposed to Turkeyâ€™s membership.â€œThereâ€™s a â€˜beforeâ€™ and an â€˜afterâ€™ to the war in Ukraine. If we don't get these countries on board, they will soon fall under Putinâ€™s clammy hand.â€ Western Balkans still waitingThe  Western Balkan region includes Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo. In Brussels, Montenegro is considered to be the furthest along in the accession process. EU enlargement is not expected until the end of the decade at the earliest. The EU has been conducting accession negotiations with Montenegro since 2012.In March, the EU decided to start accession negotiations with Bosnia-Herzegovina (BiH). However, the first accession conference is only to be organised once the country has implemented unfulfilled reform requirements, for example in the fight against corruption and organised crime. Despite continuous efforts, promises, and significant progress, due to frequent internal political disagreements, BiH faces challenges on its path to EU membership.â€œOur generation is now faced with the task of defending and strengthening the European project of peace and freedom, even if it costs an incredible amount of energy,â€ Baerbock said. She added that reforms are necessary for this to succeed. This would also include fewer veto options in the EU Council.North Macedonia has been an EU candidate for 17 years. In line with the EUâ€™s criteria for accession negotiations, the nation must fully embrace the EU acquis and push forward reforms, especially in areas like judicial reform and combating corruption and organised crime. Regional collaboration and positive neighbourly relations are crucial for North Macedoniaâ€™s enlargement process. Efforts to engage inclusively in regional cooperation and uphold bilateral agreements, such as the Prespa Agreement with Greece and the Treaty on Good Neighborly Relations with Bulgaria, are pivotal.North Macedonia has pledged to enact constitutional amendments aimed at bolstering the rights of minorities. The focus is on integrating citizens, like Bulgarians, residing within the stateâ€™s borders into the constitutional framework.The opposition however opposes the necessary constitutional changes, and parliamentÂ failed to secure the necessary majority for constitutional changes, stalling North Macedoniaâ€™s European aspirations.Slovenia - still high support for EUBy joining the EU, Slovenia has fulfilled one of the key strategic foreign policy objectives it set after independence. Support for the EU among Slovenians remains high and above average compared to other EU members, and there are no parliamentary parties that are considered eurosceptic. Yet some insiders believe that in recent years there has been too little systematic investment in European policy and the main drivers of economic growth to make Slovenia one of the more successful and visible members of the union.Among the new member states, Slovenia has also grown economically, but much slower than the other countries that joined the EU at the same time or even later. At the time of EU accession, Slovenia was at 88 percent of the EU average, measured in terms of GDP per capita; now it is at 91 percent. Over the 20 years of membership, Slovenia has received a total of 13.5 billion euros from the EU budget and paid in 8.7 billion euros, leaving a surplus of 4.8 billion euros in EU funds over that period. But it has made good use of the benefits of the internal market, which has boosted trade in goods and services.Successful European integration – with unresolved issuesOn Tuesday, Slovak President Zuzana ÄŒaputovÃ¡ described the integration into the Union and NATO as one of the most important and successful moments of Slovakia in its modern history. â€œIt was a success of the whole country, of all its citizens,â€ the head of state stressed. She recalled that the importance of membership was reflected in the countryâ€™s everyday life. â€œThrough the development of infrastructure, job opportunities, but also a safer Slovakia,â€ she added.Â ÄŒaputovÃ¡ also stated that although the EU and NATO have undergone changes over two decades, the same rules that applied when Slovakia joined still apply in both groupings. â€œEach member country must remain a functioning democracy,â€ she reminded.Von der Leyen: States like Czechia teach EU lot about Russiaâ€™s behaviour In an interview end of April with several news agencies, among them the Czech News Agency CTK, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that â€œthanks to the bitter experience that countries in Central and Eastern Europe had with the Soviet Union, the EU has learned a lot about the patterns of behaviour of the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin and has become more vigilantâ€.Von der Leyen added that the European Union is not perfect, â€œbut the benefits of EU membership are enormousâ€. The enlargement also changed the status of the EU itself. It gained much more weight and importance. â€œOf course we are much stronger by 27 than we were with 15 [of us] at that time,â€ von der Leyen said.Von der Leyen stressed that the living standards of EU residents increased, people stayed in Poland instead of migrating to the western countries. The enlargement of the EU by ten countries has also had huge economic benefits. The EU market has become one of the largest internal markets in the world and trade within the EU has increased by 40 percent compared to 2004. â€œIn the ten new member states, six million new jobs have been created in those 20 years, and unemployment has halved,â€ von der Leyen said.This article is published weekly.

European Commission prolongs green light for state aid to farmers,"Normally, the EU's aid rules prevent member states from giving companies an advantage over competitors. The extension announced on Thursday only applies to agriculture and fisheries. Brussels - The European Commission on Thursday said it is extending by six months temporary measures allowing European Union countries to pay state aid to farmers affected by market shocks.The decision means governments will be allowed to give struggling agricultural companies aid worth up to â‚¬280,000 until the end of 2024. The equivalent limit for the fisheries and aquaculture sectors is â‚¬335,000.The EU's strict state aid rules normally prevent member states from giving companies an advantage over their competitors, as a safeguard against anticompetitive mercantilism.But after Russia's all-out invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the commission decided to temporarily loosen those rules to help Europe's economy withstand the shocks of sanctions and Russian counter-sanctions.The commission is now phasing out those temporary measures. Most are due to expire at the end of June.The extension announced on Thursday only applies to agriculture and fisheries. It means those two sectors will continue to benefit from the looser state aid rules until the end of December, whereas the measures for other industries are due to expire on June 30.However, specific provisions geared towards reducing Europe's fossil-fuel dependence aren't due to expire until the end of 2025.Amidst angry protests by farmers over the last several months, EUÂ politicians have been emphasizing the need to ease the burden on the agricultural sector.

German member of European Parliament seriously injured in assault,"AÂ German politician was putting up campaign posters ahead of the upcoming European Parliament elections in the eastern German city of Dresden when he was attacked and seriously injured by four assailants, police and his party said on Saturday.Dresden, GermanyÂ - The incident occurred Friday evening. Matthias Ecke, who is a Social Democrat lawmaker in the European Parliament, was taken to hospital with serious injuries and required an operation, his party said.Police said they have not identified the attackers. A special state violent crime task force has taken over the investigation into the attack, according to Saxony's Interior Ministry.News of the attack prompted outraged reactions from politicians from several of Germany's political parties, who decried the violence.At a democracy congress for the upcoming European elections in Berlin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Saturday that the attack on Ecke was depressing.""Democracy is threatened by something like this, and that is why shrugging our shoulders is never an option,"" said Scholz. ""We must stand together against it.""The fact that such things happen also has something to do with the speeches that are made and the moods that are created, said Scholz, referring to the right-wing populist Alternative for Germany (AfD).The SPD's leaders in Saxony blamed the AfD and other right-wing extremist groups for sowing hatred against democratic politicians and warned that right-wing supporters ""are now completely uninhibited"" and see democratic politicians as ""fair game.""Minutes before Ecke was attacked on Friday, according to the police, a group of four unidentified assailants had attacked a 28-year-old Green Party campaign worker while he was putting up posters in the same part of Dresden.The perpetrators punched and kicked him, and the 28-year-old was also injured.Due to similar descriptions of the attackers and the proximity of the attacks in both time and location, investigators believe that the same group carried out both assaults.The SPD party organization in Saxony said that other campaign teams placing posters had faced insults and attempts at intimidation and that posters had been destroyed.The attack is an ""unmistakable alarm signal to all people in this country,"" the co-chairs of the SPD in Saxony, Henning Homann and Kathrin Michel, said in a statement.""The series of attacks by thugs on poster teams of democratic parties is an attack on the foundations of our democracy. The violent action and intimidation of democrats is the tool of fascists.""German democracy ""must not tolerate this,"" the SPD leaders said. ""And it is also clear that we will not be silenced!""Saxony's state premier, Michael Kretschmer of the centre-right Christian Democrats (CDU), warned that political street violence was a reminder of the darkest periods in German history.""It is shocking and an attack on our democratic values, the attack on SPD top candidate Matthias Ecke appals me deeply and cannot be justified by anything,"" Kretschmer said in a post on X (formerly Twitter).The party's national co-chairs, Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil, described Ecke's beating as an ""insidious attack"" on the entire party and all campaign workers ""who passionately stand up for our democracy and the rule of law.""""The perpetrators want to intimidate us as representatives of a democratic society. But they will never succeed,"" Esken and Klingbein said in a statement on Saturday.German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, also a member of the SPD, said that if authorities confirm that the attack on Ecke was politically motivated, ""then this serious act of violence is also a serious attack on democracy.""There have also been several violent incidents during election campaigns across Germany, most recently on Thursday evening in the western German city of Essen, where the Green Party member of parliament Kai Gehring and his party colleague Rolf Fliss were attacked after a party event.",1
Von der Leyen warns China's Xi on 'market distorting practices',"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has warned Chinese President Xi Jinping that the European Union will not tolerate Beijing's ""market distorting practices"".Paris - Xi was scheduled to meet von der Leyen and French President Emmanuel Macron at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace on Monday morning. He arrived in the French capital on Sunday on a six-day European trip which will also include stops in Serbia and Hungary.Chinese state subsidies for its electric vehicle and steel industries pose a serious threat to European industries and could even lead to ""de-industrialization in Europe,"" von der Leyen said, in comments made public.""China is currently manufacturing, with massive subsidies, more than it is selling due to its own weak domestic demand,"" von der Leyen said. ""This is leading to an oversupply of Chinese subsidized goods, such as EVs [electric vehicles] and steel, that is leading to unfair trade,"" she added.Von der Leyen said ""current imbalances in market access are not sustainable and need to be addressed.""The European Commission announced last year that it would examine possible tariffs on electric cars from China. Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has signed a deal to begin manufacturing cars in Hungary, where Xi will end his European trip on Friday.Von der Leyen emphasized that the EU is not seeking to ""decouple from China,"" describing Europe's relationship with China as ""one of the most complex, but also one of the most important.""According to reports from Paris, Xi's state visit will focus on the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, economic issues and climate protection. Cooperation in the fields of culture, sport and science are also on the agenda.Following the meeting at the Ã‰lysÃ©e Palace, Macron and Xi plan to meet in the afternoon for one-on-one talks. A Franco-Chinese business meeting and a state banquet are scheduled for the evening.",1
Europe Day 2024: In the shadow of the pollsÂ ,"On May 9, the calendar marks Europe Day, commemorating the Schuman Declaration in 1950. The historical plan was a proposal to place the French and the West German production of coal and steel under one single authority, which would later become the European Union. Less than a month out from the European elections, what does this Europe Day have in store?Â â€œMay 9, Europe Day, is not just a day of remembrance, but also a day to consider our shared future. The dayâ€™s proximity to the elections makes it a more meaningful occasion than everâ€, explained the European Parliament in a press release. The date, May 9, commemorates French Foreign Minister Robert Schumanâ€™s historic declaration in 1950 on the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community, which later became the European Union. Since 1985, this day has been marked with celebrations and festivities throughout Europe.Â Â â€œUse your vote.

Or others will decide for youâ€: the campaign slogan of the European Parliament and the blue-starred EU flag will be projected onto monuments on the night of Europe Day – among them the Colosseum in Rome, the Grand Place in Brussels to the Samuel Beckett Bridge in Dublin, Vilniusâ€™ town hall or Bratislavaâ€™s Presidential palace.â€œWith these illuminations taking place in cities across the continent, the European Parliament and national and local authorities are working together to send a united message to 440 million European citizens about the importance of these European elections for everyoneâ€™s futureâ€, read the European Parliamentâ€™s statement. Since the illuminations are on public display, they are directed at every person, not solely those who are eligible to vote. Between June 6 and 9, EU citizens are called to vote for 720 members of the European Parliament. Last October, the EU Agency for Cybersecurity had already called for vigilance ahead of the June elections saying â€œinformation manipulation campaigns are considered to be a major threat to election processesâ€.Â Disinformation and propaganda have been a matter of discussion in the run-up to the elections, as well asÂ  on social media. Experts say, far-right populist parties are way ahead of their traditional rivals in the race for voter attention on social media, where disinformation is stirring fear and rage around key issues in the European elections.Celebrations across Europe: Inclusion, anniversaries and the looking into the future of the blocCelebrations of Europe Day are touching the domains of art, culture, politics and more. Through music, dance, discussions, screenings and other formats thousands of people commemorate peace, unity and the European idea. Member states and candidates are hosting festivities in a plethora of cities, often in collaboration with national entities, EU institutions or civil society.The European Commission and the European Parliament already opened their doors to interested visitors in Brussels on May 4 and in StraÃŸbourg on April 27. For the first time, the European Parliament will mark Europe Day celebrations on its Luxembourg premises with a â€œdemocracy villageâ€, cultural performances and a new Europa Experience exhibition opening to the public on May 9.In Italy, for the first time since the establishment of Europe Day, three historic Italian villages will be lit up in blue.Â  A key event will be held in Romeâ€™s Piazza del Campidoglio with a debate, readings and music.To celebrate Europe Day, the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation, JosÃ© Manuel Albares, will take part in the event â€˜Why Europe Mattersâ€™ on May 8 in Madrid, with a performance of the EU anthem Ode to Joy by the Philharmonic Orchestra and dialogues on the impact and future of the EU. In Slovenia, this yearâ€™s celebration of Europe Day will mark 20 years of EU membership. The main celebration of the anniversary will take place on May 9 in Europe Square, shared by Italy and Slovenia. 20 years ago, the then Prime Minister of Slovenia Anton Rop and the President of the European Commission at the time, Romano Prodi, counted down the seconds until Sloveniaâ€™s accession to the EU on the square.In Bulgariaâ€™s capital Sofia, visitors will have the opportunity to try local food and drinks from EU member states and enjoy music and dance from different parts of Europe. As part of the LUNAR festival, a 3D light show will illuminate the National Art Gallery Palace.EU-candidate Albania also celebrates Europe Day annually. On May 4, Europe Week launched in ShkodÃ«r with a focus on inclusiveness, diversity and human rights. Europe Week will come to a close on May 9 with a Europe Fair in Albaniaâ€™s capital Tirana. International Charlemagne Prize and Charlemagne Youth PrizeIn the German city ofÂ Aachen, traditionally the award ceremony of the International Charlemagne Prize for services to Europe is held on Ascension Day. This year Ascension Day also falls on May 9. First awarded in 1950, this yearâ€™s award will go to Chief Rabbi Pinchas Goldschmidt, who is the President of the Conference of European Rabbis (CER), and the Jewish people in Europe.According to the Board of Directors of the Society for the Conferring of the International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen, the prize is awarded to Pinchas Goldschmidt â€œin recognition of his outstanding efforts to promote peace, the right of all peoples to self-determination, European values, tolerance, pluralism and understanding, and in acknowledgement of his significant commitment to interreligious and intercultural dialogueâ€.https://twitter.com/KarlspreisAC/status/1748300581637099676The chairman of the Charlemagne Prize Board of Directors, JÃ¼rgen Linden, emphasised that the Charlemagne Prize does not take a position on the Middle East conflict, but supports the opinion of the designated laureate Goldschmidt, who calls for a long-term ceasefire, lasting peace and the right of peoples to self-determination.Last yearâ€™s recipient was Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky.Since 2008, the Charlemagne Youth Prize is awarded two days prior to the Charlemagne Prize. Each year, the European Parliament and the International Charlemagne Prize Foundation launch a competition targeted at young people between 16 and 30 across all member states who actively participate in shaping Europe and promote European understanding.Â This year, Sisterhood Pathways, a project from Lithuania that is aiming at combatting violence against women in the Baltics has won the Charlemagne Youth Prize – taking home 7.500 Euros.This article is published weekly.

European Commission lists Booking.com as digital 'gatekeeper',"The European Commission has decided that travel website Booking.com will have to comply with requirements for designated gatekeepers under the EUâ€™s Digital Markets Act. It will also look into whether X should be considered a gatekeeper.Brussels (dpa) – On Monday, the European Commission announced it has decided to list travel website Booking.com as a ""gatekeeper"" under the European Union's digital competition law, the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The decision means Amsterdam-based Booking will have six months to adopt various pro-competition practices required by the DMA, such as allowing other companies to access data generated by the platform.A gatekeeper under the DMA is a company that holds a powerful, entrenched position in the EU's digital economy, acting as an intermediary between many users and businesses. Gatekeepers that fail to comply with their obligations under the DMA can face fines as high as 10 percent of their global annual revenue. Repeat offenders may be fined up to 20 percent.Booking is the seventh company to be designated a gatekeeper under the DMA. The other six were designated in September last year: Google parent company Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok-owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft.In addition to adding Booking to this list, the Commission said it is also opening an investigation into whether or not X should be considered a gatekeeper.According to the Commission's press release, X has argued that ""despite meeting the thresholds, X does not qualify as a[n] important gateway between businesses and consumers."" The investigation will take five months, the Commission said.However, the Commission has decided not to assign gatekeeper status to X's advertising service, X Ads, because ""although X Ads meets the quantitative designation thresholds under the DMA, this core platform service does not qualify as an important gateway.""

European Union loosens farm subsidy rules after months of protests,"Farmers have been protesting the EU's red tape across Europe. On Monday, member states agreed to relax environmental rules for farmers applying for subsidies through the bloc's Common Agricultural Policy. Brussels  - Member states of the European Union on Monday agreed to loosen the environmental regulations for farmers seeking subsidies under the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).The revision means farmers would face fewer hurdles when applying for CAP subsidies. For example, farmers would no longer be obliged to leave parts of their arable land fallow.Lively protests brought the EU's political centre in Brussels to a standstill in February, as farmers in convoys of tractors protested EU red tape. The CAP pays subsidies farmers rely on to stay afloat, but payments are conditional on strict environmental protection rules.On March 15, the European Commission responded by proposing to loosen some of the CAP's environmental regulations. The member states gave final approval to the proposals on Monday, which is extremely quick by EU standards. The European Parliament approved the measures on April 24.In addition to lifting fallow land rules, the revised CAP will require member states to offer additional financial support for farmers who voluntarily leave some land unused.The revision also loosens the rules requiring farmers to rotate the types of crops they grow. Farmers will be permitted to choose between rotating crops and diversifying them, provided the member state they work in has authorized this.Member states will also be allowed to exempt certain crops and soil types from rules on tillage, soil cover and crop rotation or diversification.EUÂ countries would also be allowed to relax environmental rules more broadly when extreme weather strikes.

"China's Xi Jinping tests European unity with tour to France, Serbia and Hungary","On his first European tour in five years, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited European leaders in France, Serbia and Hungary. While relations with Belgrade and Budapest are blossoming, Paris â€“ and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen â€“ failed to persuade the Chinese leader to soothe the EUâ€™s concerns over global trade and Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine.Chinese President Xi Jinping departed from Budapest on Friday, completing his first European tour since 2019, which also took him to France and Serbia.Â The Chinese leader sought to bridge gaps with France and the European Union, but has juggled this goal with trying to strengthen its trade alliances with Serbia – one of the most pro-Russian countries in Europe – and Hungary, which is one of the most fractious states within the EU.Serbia and Hungary are both seen as among the most sympathetic to Moscow in Europe. While not having made major breakthroughs with France or the EU, China significantly strengthened its ties with Budapest and Belgrade.Xi is travelling at a time when the continent is divided over how to deal with Beijingâ€™s growing power and the rivalry between the United States and China, although there are efforts to deepen relations in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.The EU is also carrying out several investigations into alleged illegal Chinese subsidies to companies operating in the EU bloc. One issue is a recent investigation into suspected unfair trade in biofuel from China in the single market, with Brussels ready to impose retaliatory measures, such as tariffs, if dumping is found. Alleged illegal subsidies to Chinese wind turbine manufacturers in Spain, Greece, France, Romania and Bulgaria are also being analysed. Beijing has slammed the moves as â€œprotectionismâ€.No breakthrough on Ukraine and EU trade issuesThe Chinese leader kicked off his tour in Paris on May 5, where he was welcomed with pomp, but also had to deal with uncomfortable questions about the Ukraine war and global trade rules. Analysts said Xi made an impression but no real breakthroughs on trade and Ukraine tensions. â€œThere was no breakthrough,â€ said analyst Ja Ian Chong from the University of Singapore, even though French President Emmanuel Macron had invited European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to Paris to press the Chinese leader over imbalances in global trade.On the war in Ukraine, Macron and von der Leyen urged Xi not to allow the export of any technology that could be used by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine and asked Beijing to do all it could to end the war. Xi, for his part, warned the West not to â€œsmearâ€ China over the conflict. During his three days in France, Xi avoided focusing the responsibility for the war in Ukraine on Russia.On trade, von der Leyen stressed the problem of Chinese overcapacity and the way that was leading to Chinese goods entering the European Union at prices too low for EU firms to compete with. â€œEurope cannot accept such market distorting practices that could lead to de-industrialisation in Europe.""European Commission President Ursula von der LeyenAt the talks in Paris, Xi hit back at accusations that Chinese overcapacity was causing global trade imbalances. He denied there was any problem of Chinese overcapacity in global trade and said China and Europe should address differences on trade through â€œdialogue and consultation, and accommodate each otherâ€™s legitimate concernsâ€, according to the Chinese foreign ministry.Serbia: sealing deals and backing territorial claimsXiâ€™s second stop was in the Serbian capital Belgrade, where China and Serbia signed a number of important agreements to seal the bilateral relationship.The visit coincided with the 25th anniversary of the 1999 US bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, which killed three people. The embassy was hit during a months-long, US-led NATO campaign targeting Serbian security forces who were at war with ethnic-Albanian insurgents in Kosovo. The US later apologised, saying outdated maps had led the pilot to strike the wrong target.Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ said Serbia would have Chinaâ€™s firm support on all issues raised in the UN. A joint statement signed by him and the Chinese president raised the level of bilateral relations from strategic ties to a community with a shared future in the new era as the highest form of cooperation between Serbia and China, he added.Â â€œI am proud to have been able to sign such a statement with Xi. We have enormous respect for China,â€ VuÄiÄ‡ said at a joint press conference.China has poured billions into Serbia and neighbouring Balkan countries, particularly into mining and manufacturing, and last year Beijing and Belgrade signed a free trade agreement.Serbia has also repeatedly supported Chinaâ€™s claims over Taiwan and in turn, Beijing has long backed Serbiaâ€™s territorial claims over the breakaway province of Kosovo. Along with Russia, China has prevented Kosovoâ€™s recognition at the United Nations.At the meeting in Belgrade, VuÄiÄ‡ declared that â€œTaiwan is Chinaâ€ and asked for Beijingâ€™s support in the face of the â€œpressures that Belgrade is facing due to its â€œautonomous policyâ€, without specifying the origin of these pressures.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n (R.) welcomes Chinese President Xi Jinping (L) at Budapest's Liszt Ferenc Airport. Photo: Vivien Cher Benko/Hungarian Prime Minister's Office/AP/dpaOrbÃ¡nâ€™s Hungary: Chinaâ€™s door into the EUThe last stop of the tour took place in Hungary, where the president was received by Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, with a view to intensifying cooperation on all fronts and strengthening the influence of the Asian giant in the region.China and Hungary signed a slew of intergovernmental agreements on the sidelines of the visit, though no details were provided by Hungarian state television, the only Hungarian broadcaster allowed to attend the ceremony. Even the outlines of the agreed â€œcomprehensive strategic partnershipâ€ are vague. OrbÃ¡n said the two countries wanted to work together in the nuclear industry, too. â€œThis has not been the case so far,â€ he said.Beijing sees Budapest as one of Chinaâ€™s entry doors into the EU to distribute its products in the bloc, including batteries for electric vehicles. That is why it has invested billions in a country that, with constant friction with Brussels, has become the largest recipient of Chinese investment in the area.Chinese car battery manufacturer CATL is building its second European factory near the eastern Hungarian city of Debrecen, while Chinese carmaker BYD is due to manufacture passenger cars in southern Szeged as early as next year.China has also helped finance a new railway line between Belgrade and Budapest as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the New Silk Road left by Italy in December. Hungary is the only EU country participating in Chinaâ€™s Belt and Road infrastructure and investment initiative.OrbÃ¡n, criticised for his authoritarian posture, is the EU leader most favourable to Russia and is inclined to align himself more with Beijing and Moscow, even at the cost of undermining the unity of the EU and NATO. The Chinese leader Xi called on Hungary, which takes over the EUâ€™s rotating presidency in the second half of the year, to â€œplay a bigger role in the EU and push for new and greater development of China-EU relationsâ€.Russian President Putin to visit BeijingWith Xi Jinpingâ€™s European tour at an end, he will soon have a high-profile visitor back at home. Following the start of his fifth term in office, Russian President Vladimir Putin will travel to China this week for his first foreign visit.The Kremlin leader is expected to arrive in Beijing on Thursday at the invitation of Xi and stay until Friday, Chinaâ€™s state news agency Xinhua reported. Putinâ€™s last official state visit to Russiaâ€™s eastern neighbour was almost six years ago.The choice of China as his first destination after his re-election in March underscores the close ties between the two nuclear powers and permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.Since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and the imposition of Western sanctions, Russia has been largely internationally isolated. However, China has not condemned the attack and has adopted a neutral stance towards the outside world, while continuing to back its long-standing partner.This article is published weekly.

EU and NATO officials criticise Georgia's 'foreign agents' law,"Georgiaâ€™s parliament has adopted its controversial â€œforeign agentsâ€ law, despite intense protests in the country. EU and NATO officials, including two European Commissioners, also heavily criticised the law.Brussels (dpa) – European Commission and NATO officials on Wednesday criticised Georgia's adoption of a law requiring foreign-funded organisations to register as ""foreign agents.""""The spirit and content of the law are not in line with EU core norms and values,"" said a statement by EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell and Enlargement Commissioner Oliver VÃ¡rhelyi.On Tuesday, Georgia's parliament passed the controversial legislation despite angry protests in the countryâ€™s capital city Tbilisi and urging by the European Union and the United States not to adopt it.Thousands of people once again took to the streets of the capital on Tuesday evening. One of their main concerns is that the law threatens Georgia's path to EU membership. Many also fear that in the former Soviet republic – as in neighbouring Russia – critical organisations and media will be silenced.""Despite large protests and unequivocal calls by the international community, the Georgian government ruling majority adopted the law 'on transparency of foreign influence' in parliament,"" the statement by Borrell and VÃ¡rhelyi said.The two Commission officials also condemned attacks on Georgian activists and journalists. ""The intimidation, threats and physical assaults on civil society representatives, political leaders and journalists, as well as their families is unacceptable. We call on the Georgian authorities to investigate these documented acts.""NATO spokeswoman Farah Dakhlallah also wrote on X that the law's passage ""is a step in the wrong direction and takes Georgia further away from European and Euro-Atlantic integration. We urge Georgia to change course and to respect the right to peaceful protest.""German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed similar sentiments on Wednesday evening. At a press conference with Swiss President Viola Amherd, he referred to his meeting with Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze in Berlin in mid-April. Scholz said that he had clearly stated at the time that he considered this law to be a mistake and that it should not be passed. ""Now that it has been passed, nothing has changed."" (15 May)",1
"Controversial new Migration and Asylum Pact to come into force in 2026, 15 EU countries demand even stricter rulesÂ Â ","On May 14, EU member states took the last hurdle to a stricter, controversial migration and asylum pact after nearly a decade of wrangling. The overhaul comes into force from 2026. However, 15 EU countries already expressed a desire to clamp down on illegal migration even further in a letter to the European Commission on Wednesday. The EU on Tuesday gave the final green light to a landmark overhaul of its migration and asylum policies that will see hardened borders and responsibility shared among member states.EU officials had been at pains to wrap up the migration reforms ahead of European elections scheduled for June. The issue has been politically divisive, especially since an influx of arrivals in 2015 that exposed the migration systemâ€™s weaknesses.The new body of law is the product of years of fierce debate, which came to a head in a tense European Parliament vote in April. The overhaul consists of ten pieces of legislation, which were supported by the vast majority of EU member states. Hungary and Poland voted against the entire package and countries such as Austria and Slovakia opposed particular parts. The Czech Republic, also a critic of the pact, abstained from all ten votes. Following confirmation by the EU countries, the new pact will now be published in the official EU journal. The member states will then have two years to put the rules adopted on Tuesday into practice. The European Commission will soon present a common implementation plan to help the member states in this process, the Belgian EU presidency said.The new laws require all 27 EU member states to take some responsibility for managing asylum applications – including those who voted against the reforms – but the package also makes the rules stricter for applicants. It establishes new border centres that will hold irregular migrants while their asylum requests are vetted. Deportations of those deemed inadmissible will be accelerated.â€œThese new rules will make the European asylum system more effective and increase solidarity between member states,â€ said Belgiumâ€™s asylum and migration minister Nicole de Moor.European Council president Charles Michel called the legislation â€œa milestone in the EUâ€™s response to manage migration and reform the systemâ€ on X, while German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called it a â€œhistoric agreementâ€. https://twitter.com/CharlesMichel/status/1790332469608112504In contrast to that, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala stated that while the pact was a first step towards tackling illegal migration, it was not enough. He said thatâ€™s the reason why the Czech Republic has co-founded a group of countries that want to tackle illegal migration more strongly.A sentiment shared by Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen who called the current situation with migrant flows towards Europe â€œunsustainableâ€ during a conference on migration challenges on May 6 in Copenhagen.  The pact is drawing criticism from migrant rights charities, some nationalist governments and researchers for different reasons. Rights group Amnesty International, for example, argued that it will â€œlead to greater human sufferingâ€.Migration researcher Judith Kohlenberger of the Vienna University of Economics and Business stated in an interview with the Austrian Press Agency that the reform was completely ignoring the fight against the causes of flight. â€œOn the one hand, we are fending off refugees, while on the other we are constantly helping to create the reasons for flight Â­Â­Â­– see the consequences of the climate crisis or economic policy. Europe is contributing to flight and labour migration,â€ emphasised Kohlenberg.According to her, the only positive thing about the EU asylum and migration pact, which is to be implemented over the next two years, is that the 27 member states have finally managed to reach a compromise on migration policy.â€œIt would have been a declaration of bankruptcy by the EU Commission if there had been no progress here.â€ This would play into the hands of the right-wing parties in the EU elections in June.The EU elections are expected to see a surge by far-right parties campaigning on the need to crack down on irregular migration. The far-right Swedish Democrats – a member of European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group in the European Parliament – for example chose â€œMy Europe is building wallsâ€ as their main slogan for the upcoming European elections.Petar Volgin, an MEP candidate for the far-right Bulgarian Vazrazhdane Party, said in an interview on Tuesday that â€œfloodingâ€ the country with migrants or, alternatively, â€œpaying exorbitant sums to keep them from coming here in the name of [Bulgaria joining the Schengen Area for air and sea travel]â€ must be taken out of the picture. Only then Bulgaria could reinstate its national sovereignty and strengthen its economy.Fabrice Leggeri, former Frontex executive director and third on the list of the French far-right National Rally party for the European elections, said he saw the June vote as â€œa referendumâ€. Frontex is the EU agency responsible for borders. Leggeri also rejected the idea that Frontex is a â€œsuper humanitarian NGOâ€ in an interview with Portuguese news agency LUSA, rather advocating for â€œpragmatismâ€ in migration management. Eurostat: Asylum applications in Europe on the rise Asylum applications in Europe are on the rise, according to Eurostat data. In 2023, 1.048.900 first-time asylum applicants were recorded which is an increase of 20 percent compared to 2022 (873.700), almost reaching the highs of 2015 and 2016. The highest number of first-time asylum applicants in 2023 in comparison to the population of each member state, was recorded in Cyprus (13 applicants per 1.000 people), followed by Greece and Austria (both six applicants per 1.000 people). Solidarity Mechanism: Take people in or pay up The mechanism is intended to relieve the burden on those countries where many refugees arrive – for example Italy, Greece or Spain. The plan is to redistribute at least 30,000 refugees from these countries to other EU states each year. If the countries do not want to take in refugees, they must provide support to the under-pressure nations, for example in the form of cash payments.In Slovenia, for example, this could mean that the country would likely have to take in 126 persons or contribute 2.8 million Euro annually.Slovakia has expressed its dissatisfaction with the new mechanism through its vote: The country voted against two proposals of the ten-point reform package – against the payment of 20,000 Euro for each unaccepted migrant and against compliance with certain asylum obligations – and abstained on eight less fundamental proposals.â€œIn particular, we did not agree on things such as the fact that if we refuse to take in migrants, we have to pay 20,000 Euro. From Slovakiaâ€™s point of view, the situation is still good today. With around 30,000 migrants to be redistributed, the impact on Slovakia would be around six million Euro, but with mass migration it would be tens of millions,â€ Slovak Finance Minister Ladislav KamenickÃ½ explained after the vote. The biggest problem for Slovakia is that the new pact does not mention a financial ceiling for such payments.Deals with third countries on the rise: 15 EU states demand further tightening of rulesIn parallel with the sweeping reforms, the EU is stepping up its deals with countries of transit and origin aimed at curbing the number of arrivals.In recent months, that has seen agreements inked with Tunisia, Mauritania and Egypt. Other examples of the trend towards outsourcing migration policies in Europe are the British Rwanda model or the bilateral Italy-Albania agreement. It entails sending migrants rescued in Italian waters to Albania while their asylum requests are processed. In February, the Albanian Parliament approved a draft law about tighter cooperation with Italy regarding migration.  Through a joint letter to the European Commission, dated May 15, fifteen EU states have demanded a further tightening of the blocâ€™s asylum policy, making it easier to transfer undocumented migrants to third countries, including when they are rescued at sea. The letter cited the example of the arrangement it made with Turkey in 2016 to take in Syrian refugees from the war in their home country. The coalition of countries was put together by the Czech Republic together with Denmark and Austria. The letter, which was signed by 15 interior ministers, was delivered to Brussels on Wednesday evening, a spokeswoman for the European Commission confirmed on Thursday. According to her, the Union executive will now deal with its content. In addition, it will also deal with the implementation of those legislations that are included in the recently adopted migration package.Signatories include Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Italy, Cyprus, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland, Romania and Finland. Italy and Greece receive a substantial number of the people making the perilous journey across the Mediterranean Sea to reach the EU – many seeking to escape poverty, war or persecution, according to the International Organization for Migration.The Tunisian coastguard intercepts small boats carrying migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean and tows them back to the coast of the southern Tunisian city of Sfax. Photo: Khaled Nasraoui/dpaExperts: Outsourcing needs clarificationThe new migration and asylum pact proposals such as third-country pacts will fall to the next EU executive which will take office after the European elections.Camille Le Coz, an expert from the Migration Policy Institute Europe, said that there were â€œmany questionsâ€ about how any such initiatives could work. Under EU law, immigrants can only be sent to a country outside the bloc where they could have applied for asylum, provided they have a sufficient link with that country. That rules out – for now – any programmes such as the United Kingdomâ€™s deal with Rwanda to send arrivals to the African country. Le Coz said that it still needs â€œto be clarifiedâ€ how proposals for any EU outsourcing deals would work as well as â€œwho the European authorities are working with and which third countries are likely to acceptâ€.Henrik Emilsson, migration researcher at MalmÃ¶ University, also classifies the idea of handling the asylum process outside of the EU as â€œpolitical slogansâ€ rather than something that can be done, at least on a short term. According to him, asylum centres outside the EU might even need a treaty change.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
EU loosens farm subsidy rules in bid to ease pressure on farmers,"Last week, EU member states approved new rules for the blocâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy, which allows farmers to apply for subsidies, albeit subject to strict environmental rules. The concessions from Brussels follow months of protests by farmers across the EU â€“ but the resistance to the EUâ€™s flagship green ambitions is not over.Less bureaucracy and fewer controls for farmers, exemptions from green obligations to access EU funds and revised procedures for modifying national strategic plans – the 27 EU member states last week approved the targeted reform of the blocâ€™s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), proposed by the European Commission in mid-March to respond to farmersâ€™ protests that have shaken Europe in recent months.Farmers have been holding the EU responsible for the – according to them– high environmental demands that they had to meet to receive subsidies from the CAP, as well as for the controversial Nature Restoration Law for the preservation of ecosystems – the latter playing a major role in the EUâ€™s Green Deal.The CAP pays subsidies farmers rely on to stay afloat, but payments are conditional on strict environmental protection rules.Lively protests against agricultural rules brought the EUâ€™s political centre in Brussels to a standstill in February, as farmers in convoys of tractors protested EU red tape. Even after recent concessions, farmersâ€™ protests do not subside in some countries, for example in Poland. On May 9, a group of eleven farmers started a protest in the Sejm, Polandâ€™s parliament, demanding a conversation with Prime Minister Donald Tusk about the EU Green Deal. They started a hunger strike a week ago. However, Tusk said in mid-May that he did not plan to meet â€œthis group of protestersâ€ because, in his opinion, â€œthey are not representative of Polish farmersâ€.After the Commission proposed to loosen some of the CAPâ€™s environmental regulations in march, EU member states now gave the final approval, which is extremely quick by EU standards. The European Parliament approved the measures on April 24.Whatâ€™s new for the CAP?The revision means farmers would face fewer hurdles when applying for CAP subsidies. For example, farmers would no longer be obliged to leave parts of their arable land fallow.In addition to lifting fallow land rules, the revised CAP will require member states to offer additional financial support for farmers who voluntarily leave some land unused.The revision also loosens the rules requiring farmers to rotate the types of crops they grow. Farmers will be permitted to choose between rotating crops and diversifying them, provided the member state they work in has authorised this.Member states will also be allowed to exempt certain crops and soil types from rules on tillage, soil cover and crop rotation or diversification. EU countries would also be allowed to relax environmental rules more broadly when extreme weather strikes.Farmers can retroactively apply the new regulations relating to environmental conditions for the year 2024, as indicated by the Council of the EU.Slovenia welcomed the measures in the CAP relieving the administrative burden on small farms. Farms smaller than ten hectares, which account for 80 percent of all farms in Slovenia, need not be checked for compliance with environmental protection-related conditions for financial support from the CAP.The Portuguese minister for agriculture, JosÃ© Manuel Fernandes, has pledged to speed up payments to farmers, introduce predictability and use all the funds available, particularly if it is support coming from the EU.Teresa Ribera, Spanish Minister for the Ecological Transition and the Demographic Challenge, described the flexibility of the environmental measures of the CAP, which has been undertaken in response to farmersâ€™ requests, as â€œadequateâ€. Ribera responded that the Minister of Agriculture, Luis Planas, responsible for agricultural policy in Spain, maintains an intense dialogue with farmers and highlighted that he â€œhas found a very appropriate way to reflect this request for flexibility on the part of farmersâ€.Resistance to EU green laws continuesWhile the European Commission sought to appease EU farmersâ€™ concerns regarding their environmental responsibilities by loosening the CAP, overall resistance to the Green Deal is far from over. The impact of the Nature Restoration Law in rural areas sparked heated debates in the European Parliament last year, and fueled agricultural anger at the start of 2024 despite the vast flexibilities introduced. The environment ministers of eleven EU states last week called on their counterparts to approve legislation requiring the restoration of damaged ecosystems, a key text of the Green Deal which is now blocked. After tough talks, negotiators from the European Parliament and member states agreed in mid-November 2023 on a watered-down version of this â€œnature restorationâ€ legislation, an agreement then ratified as is at the end of February by MEPs .But the final formal green light from the 27 EU member states, essential before this text comes into force, is still awaited. Due to lack of the required majority (15 countries representing 65% of the EU population), the subject was withdrawn from a meeting of EU ambassadors at the end of March.Environmental organisations such as Greenpeace have denounced the changes to the CAP, but French MEP JÃ©rÃ©my Decerle believes that the new regulation does not have to stop the EUâ€™s environmental agenda. â€œThere is no need to revise the (climate) objectives. We have to remain ambitious when it comes to the environment, because it is also useful and essential for farmers. But at the same time we must give sufficient technical, financial and human resources (to the sector),â€ he said in an interview with EFE.Geert Wilders (PVV), Dilan YeÅŸilgÃ¶z (VVD), Caroline van der Plas (BBB) and Pieter Omtzigt (NSC) stand during the presentation of the coalition agreement. The four parties PVV, NSC, VVD and BBB have agreed to form a government in the Netherlands. Photo: Koen Van Weel/ANP/dpa +++ dpa-Bildfunk +++Dutch farmers push for even fewer restrictionsIn the Netherlands, the anticipated new government coalition – consisting of the far-right populist PVV, liberal VVD, centre-right NSC and agrarian conservative BBB parties – intends to push for adapting European rules, for example for the use of fertilisers. â€œIn Europe, we will do everything with courage to adapt European guidelines so that they are workable and support the revenue model,â€ according to a coalition agreement presented last week.Furthermore, the anticipated coalition wants a â€œreassessmentâ€ of protected Natura 2000 areas to eliminate â€œscattered natureâ€. The parties want to get rid of the EU maximum of 170 kilos of nitrogen emissions from animal fertiliser per year that will apply in vulnerable areas.The Dutch action group for farmers, the Farmers Defence Force (FDF), was â€œvery happyâ€ with the presented coalition agreement. â€œFive years of protests have not been in vain, a crowning achievement of our work,â€ said leader Mark van den Oever.He pointed to a large upcoming demonstration by farmersâ€™ organisations in Brussels on June 4. â€œWe hope that we can achieve the same thing in Europe. Then the circle will be complete. We all have to go full throttle once more,â€ van den Oever said.Only after the elections for the European Parliament can new parties, such as the BBB, but also the NSC, submit a request to an existing European group to be part of it. The two parties are currently not represented in the European Parliament, as they were established after the last EU-wide elections in 2019.This article is published weekly.

"Survey: More EU citizens speak foreign languages, but fewer German","A new Eurobarometer survey published by the European Commission shows that while Europeans' foreign language skills have improved, the proportion of respondents who can speak German has fallen.Brussels (dpa) – The foreign language skills of EU citizens have increased in recent years, but not when it comes to German, a Eurobarometer survey published by the European Commission in Brussels on Tuesday revealed.In 2023, almost 60 percent of Europeans stated that they could hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue, up 3 percent on the previous survey from 2012, and almost 80 percent of 15-24-year-olds, up 5 percent.German is still one of the most widely spoken foreign languages in the EU: According to the survey, 10 percent of Europeans can hold a conversation in German, even if they are not native speakers. Compared to 2012, however, this is a drop of two points – and German proficiency has also fallen among 15-24-year-olds by four points to 12 percent.The situation is different with English: The language is spoken by almost half of Europeans as a foreign or second language and has also gained in popularity compared to the previous survey. It is striking that this knowledge is even more widespread among younger EU citizens at 70 percent.A total of 11 percent of non-native speakers in the EU can hold a conversation in French, putting the language ahead of German (10 percent) and Spanish, which 7 percent of respondents said they could.According to the European Commission, more than 26,500 people aged 15 and over in the 27 EU member states were interviewed for the survey. The surveys were conducted in person in all countries between September and October 2023 and were supplemented by self-completion interviews in the Czech Republic, Denmark, Malta and Finland.

Germany's far-right AfD bans EU top candidate from public appearances,"Maximilian Krah, the lead candidate for Germany's far-right AfD party in the EU elections, will no longer make public appearances after telling the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that not all members of the SS were criminals.Berlin (dpa) – Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has banned its lead candidate for the European election, Maximilian Krah, from making public appearances, following his comments that not all SS members were criminals.A party spokesman confirmed a report in the German Bild newspaper on Wednesday that the federal executive committee had banned Krah from making public appearances around two weeks before the EU election.Krah declared on the social media platform X that he would refrain from further election campaign appearances and would resign as a member of the federal executive committee. The move comes a day after the French far-right National Rally party said it no longer wants to sit in the same parliamentary group as the AfD over Krah's comments.Krah told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that not all members of the SS were criminals, referring to the Schutzstaffel (SS), a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.""I will never say that everyone who wore an SS uniform was automatically a criminal,"" said Krah. When asked whether the SS were war criminals, he replied, ""There was certainly a high percentage of criminals, but not all of them were criminals.""Nazi concentration camps were guarded and administered by the SS, which was heavily involved in war crimes. The organisation was declared a criminal organisation in the Nuremberg trials after the end of World War II. (22 May)",1
Germany and France call for reforms to EU economic policy,"The economy ministers of Germany and France have called for reforms to EU economic policy. A concept published on Thursday also calls for a shift away from fossil fuels, although the two countries differ on how to achieve this.Berlin (dpa) – German Economy Minister Robert Habeck and his French counterpart Bruno Le Maire jointly published a draft concept on Thursday calling for reforms to the European Unionâ€™s economic policy.The two ministers urged the need to cut red tape and promote greater economic growth over the next five years. Research into artificial intelligence (AI), biotechnology and aerospace needed to be stimulated, they said.The defence sector also needed to be boosted, along with greater cross-border cooperation. Investment from the European Investment Bank (EIB) was needed here, Habeck and Le Maire said.While the concept calls for rapid conversion of the energy sector away from fossil fuels, Germany and France are taking divergent approaches, with Paris relying on nuclear power and Germany having shut down all its nuclear power plants. The two countries nevertheless pledged to work together to find common ground to achieve the EU's climate and energy targets. (23 May)",1
All out for energy security: Two years of REPowerEU and the Electricity Market Reform,"In a bid to decrease dependence on Russian fossil fuels in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and disruptions in the global energy market, the EU launched the REPowerEU initiative in May of the same year. As the joint initiative just turned two, the European Commission released country reports tracking progress.Diversifying the EUâ€™s energy supplies, speeding up the green transition and improving the blocâ€™s energy security are the goals of the REPowerEU plan which celebrated its two-year anniversary recently.On Tuesday, EU ministers gave final approval to the electricity market reform – also geared towards improving the blocâ€™s energy security. The reform further promotes the expansion of renewable energies and should better protect consumers from escalating electricity prices in the future.Two years of REPowerEUÂ Faced with the difficulties and disruptions in the global energy market caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the European Commission launched the REPowerEU plan in May 2022. The plan foresees energy saving goals, the production of clean energy and the diversification of energy supplies – and ultimately ending the dependency on Russian fossil fuels. Since the adoption of the REPowerEU plan, the EU has successfully reduced gas supplies from Russia. The share of gas from Russia – by pipeline and Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) – made up 45 percent of all imported gas in 2021, but only 15 percent in 2023. The Union replaced it with gas from other third countries. Norway and the USA have become the largest gas suppliers.Seaborne imports of Russian crude oil, refined petroleum products and Russian coal imports have been banned through EU sanctions. Natural gas consumption: How much did member states reduce?In 27 country reports released for the two-year anniversary of REPowerEU, the European Commission compiled member statesâ€™ performances between August 2022 and January 2024. Each country report includes a country-specific analysis on a range of points, for example on the key energy figures, diversification of energy supplies, energy price developments or the natural gas demand reduction. The EU countries had agreed on a voluntary 15 percent reduction target of natural gas consumption and almost all countries have managed to lower their gas consumption. On EU level, the countries achieved a decrease of 18 percent.21 countries lowered their gas consumption even further than the agreed-upon reduction target, including Denmark (-40%), Finland (-39%), Latvia (-30%), Sweden (-29%), Lithuania (-29%), Estonia (-28%), the Netherlands (-27%), Luxembourg (-26%), Portugal (-23%), Slovakia (-22%), France (-20%), Romania (-19%), Austria (-19%), Hungary (-18%) and Bulgaria (-18%), Italy (-17%), Croatia (-17%), Czechia (-17%), Greece (-16%), Germany (-16%) and Belgium (-16%).Â Â According to the European Commissionâ€™s data, only five countries did not meet the 15 percent reduction target. Among those are Spain (-12%), Slovenia (-10%), Poland (-8%), Ireland (-4%) and Malta, the only country which increased its gas consumption by ten percent. According to the report, Cyprus does not use natural gas.Â Slovenia: Cutting down on consumption, but still reliant on Russian gasIn the case of Slovenia, the REPowerEU report pointed out that while the country â€œhas taken measures to strengthen alternative supplies of natural gasâ€, it â€œeffectively remains reliant on Russian gas imported through Austriaâ€.Data by the Slovenian Energy Agency shows that in 2023 Slovenia imported 68.3 percent of gas from Austria and 28.3 percent from Algeria, through Italy. The agency cannot say with certainty how much of the gas imported from Austria is of Russian origin.Â Even though gas importers have not had direct contracts for supply of gas from Russia for 2023 or 2024, the Energy Agency believes that the share of Russian gas was still predominant both in 2023 and in the first part of 2024.Moving forward on renewables with room for improvementÂ The EU and its member states are continuously working towards becoming more sustainable and less reliant on fossil fuels. What have countries achieved so far? In 2023, according to the European Commission, Portugal for example installed around 1.3 gigawatts of renewable electricity capacity, bringing the total to 18.4 gigawatts – in comparison to 5.1 gigawatts in 2021. Additionally, the annual growth rate of installed renewable energy capacity increased to 7.6 percent compared to 6.1 percent in 2021. However, the countryâ€™s energy mix still included 69 percent fossil fuels in 2022.Neighbouring Spain accelerated its transition towards a decarbonised energy system. According to Spanish grid operator Red ElÃ©ctrica, renewables accounted for 65.2 percent of the Spanish electricity mix in March - an all-time high. Still, the REPowerEU Spain report states that fossil fuels continue to play a central role in the countryâ€™s energy system, representing 70.1 percent of primary energy imported in 2021.Â Croatia quickly deduced its dependence on Russian gas imports by increasing its own production and intensifying the use of the existing LNG terminal. However, Croatia is still highly dependent on energy imports from countries outside the EU. Fossil fuels also continue to play an important role in Croatiaâ€™s energy mix, as they accounted for 72 percent of gross available energy in 2022.Â Moving into a greener direction, the country could soon start to produce green hydrogen: INA, the leading Croatian oil and gas company, recently signed two contracts related to renewable energy projects – one for the production of green hydrogen and the other for a bio-methane production facility. The completion of the construction of both plants is expected in 2026. The green hydrogen project, together with its solar plant and logistic capacity, will be co-financed via the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF).The EUâ€™s RRF is a tool providing grants and loans to support reforms and investments in member states. It should, among other things, help member states become more sustainable, boost progress with the green and digital transition and achieve the EU target of climate neutrality by 2050.â€¦just hang on for a yearIn Bulgaria, one of the major national energy reforms has been postponed by a year, which means the artificial maintenance of coal capacity will remain for at least another twelve months. This, in turn, could lead to the country not receiving the expected 1.3 billion BNG (around 665.15 million Euro) under the Bulgarian National Recovery and Resilience Plan which is funded under the EUâ€™s RFF. The energy reform is a mandatory requirement.Â While Bulgarian MPs justified this citing a lack of readiness to switch from a regulated to a free electricity market or funds, several media outlets and experts attributed the decision mostly to pre-election populism.Â According to the Belgian Energy Minister, the electricity market reform is ""paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market"". Photo: APA/HELMUT FOHRINGERA reformed energy market for security and a green futureThis week, the electricity market reform took its final hurdle after representatives from EU member states and the European Parliament had signed off on the market reforms last December.Belgiumâ€™s Energy Minister Tinne Van der Straeten described the day as a â€œmilestone for the EUâ€ on the path to a carbon-free and greener future. â€œBy adopting the electricity market reform, we are empowering consumers, ensuring security of supply and paving the way for a more stable, predictable and sustainable energy market.â€New long-term contracts between governments and electricity producers, under which the state would chip in if the market price drops below an agreed price, are central to the reform efforts.This is meant to incentivise domestic green and nuclear power production by ensuring a return on investments.It also protects consumers who, in the future, have the right to both fixed-price contracts and contracts with dynamic prices. This would allow consumers to opt for both secure, long-term prices and contracts with changing prices if they want to take advantage of price fluctuations – for example, to use electricity when it is cheaper for charging electric cars or for heat pumps.How does the electricity market work?Â The electricity market in the EU works according to the merit-order principle, defining the order in which power plants connected to the electricity exchange are used to deliver energy and to determine the market price.Those that can produce electricity at relatively low marginal cost, like wind farms, are used first to cover demand. But as demand rises beyond those initial sourcesâ€™ capabilities, higher marginal cost sources are used.The final price therefore depends on which sources need to be used to meet demand, as well as fluctuations in the costs of using those sources. For example, a surge in natural gas prices raises the cost of using gas-fired power plants.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
EU first in the world to tackle artificial intelligence with landmark regulation,"EU member states last week adopted the blocâ€™s landmark Artificial Intelligence Act, the first legislation in the world to tackle this cutting-edge technology. Now that the legislative phase is over, what challenges will countries face when implementing the unprecedented rules into national law?Last week, EU ministers unanimously gave their final approval to the Artificial Intelligence Act (AI Act), a landmark new law that regulates the use of the transformative technology in â€œhigh-riskâ€ situations, such as law enforcement and employment.â€œThe adoption of the AI Act is a significant milestone for the European Union. This landmark law, the first of its kind in the world, addresses a global technological challenge that also creates opportunities for our societies and economies,â€ said Belgian secretary of state for Digitisation, Mathieu Michel.Â At a global level, AI is also being closely watched. Last week, more than a dozen countries and some of the worldâ€™s biggest tech firms gathered in Seoul for an AI summit co-hosted by the United Kingdom and South Korea. They pledged to cooperate against the potential dangers of AI, including its ability to dodge human control.The EUâ€™s regulation allows or prohibits the use of AI depending on the risk it generates for people and identifies high-risk systems that can only be used if it is demonstrated that they respect fundamental rights. Which AI is being targeted by the law?AI systems for biometric categorisation based on political, religious, philosophical beliefs or race and sexual orientation will be prohibited. Systems that rate people based on their behaviour or personal characteristics or AI capable of manipulating human behaviour will be banned from use. Systems to expand or create facial databases captured indiscriminately through the internet or audiovisual recordings will also be prohibited. However, the regulation allows exceptions, so that security forces may use biometric identification cameras, always with judicial authorisation, for example to prevent a terrorist threat.Furthermore, the law stipulates that content generated with AI, such as AI-generated texts, images or videos, will have to be labelled as such. This should help protect viewers against misleading content, such as deepfakes.High-risk systems will have to obtain certification from approved bodies before they can be put on the EU market. A new â€œAI Officeâ€' will oversee enforcement at EU level. Failure to comply with the regulation can lead to fines up to 35 million Euro or seven percent of a companyâ€™s annual revenue, depending on the type of offender.Portuguese push to tackle AIThe European Commission proposed the first draft of the AI Act in April 2021. At the time, Portugal held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union. One of the ambitions of the Portuguese government – which had a socialist majority at the time – was to push for the adoption of the first EU law on AI, based on transparency and respect for usersâ€™ rights.â€œWe attach great importance to the legal framework for artificial intelligence. Right now, itâ€™s clear that artificial intelligence is the basis for enhanced productivity and has great potential for growth,â€ said the then Minister of Economy, Pedro Siza Vieira, in January 2021.The AI Act already received the backing of a majority of Members of the European Parliament in March 2024. The two rapporteurs for the file were Italian MEP Brando Benifei and Romanian MEP DragoÈ™ Tudorache.Following Tuesday's unanimous vote among ministers to finalise the AI Act, it must be signed by the presidents of the EU legislature and then published in the Official Journal of the EU. It then technically becomes law 20 days later, but its various provisions will come into effect gradually over the following two years.Challenges for the implementation phaseWith the legislative process for the AI Act at an end, EU member states will have to implement the regulation into their respective national legislation – with some representatives at last weekâ€™s meeting pointing out future challenges.â€œWe tried to find a balance between the two approaches so that artificial intelligence develops and so that, for example, smaller companies are not overwhelmed by bureaucracy, but at the same time so that the use of artificial intelligence in the European environment has its barriers,â€ said Czech Deputy Prime Minister for Digitisation and Minister of Regional Development Ivan BartoÅ¡, who represented the country during the meeting of EU ministers.The focus on the implementation process was echoed by Ivan IvanÄin, state secretary of the Ministry of Investment, Regional Development and Informatics of the Slovak Republic, who said â€œit represents an opportunity for learningâ€. He added that â€œat the same time, it is important to implement concrete steps that will create a solid foundation for further developmentâ€.Bulgariaâ€™s caretaker government supported the adoption of the AI Act. Bulgarian Entrepreneurial Association CEO Dobromir Ivanov noted that the AI Act is a step in the right direction, but stressed that it is important to watch what will be done from now on. He said that implementation should not be too restrictive or destroy local companies.Â During a discussion at the conference â€œygeiamou 2024 – The Health System and the Challenges of the Futureâ€ in Athens, Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis spoke about the application of AI in healthcare. In particular, he pointed out that when processing patient data with AI, for example, it is important to manage it securely.AI experts wantedSlovenian Minister for Digital Transformation, Emilija Stojmenova Duh, warned of the lack of AI experts. â€œAt the moment, not only in Slovenia, but in Europe in general, we do not have enough qualified experts, so we need to work on that.â€She thinks experts from all member states should participate in the EU regulatory authority for AI, which has already been set up by the European Commission. This will also make it easier to implement the act in member states, she said.In Romania, the construction of the first research institute on AI began last week at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The institute will focus on developing AI solutions for vital areas such as health, transport, cyber security and more, and will offer students and researchers cutting-edge resources and the chance to work on projects with global impact.Fact check: Fake news video created with artificial intelligenceWith the use of artificial intelligence, anyone can create artificial images or videos, which are often used to mislead viewers of such content – so-called deepfakes. In a video circulating online in February and March 2024, a news reporter is seen saying that French President Emmanuel Macron had to cancel his trip to Ukraine to meet President Volodymyr Zelensky because of an alleged plot to assassinate him.The fact-checking team by German Press Agency dpa explained that the video was fake and that both the audio – the presenter's voice – and the video footage had been altered using AI.

"Spain, Ireland, Norway formally recognize Palestinian statehood","In a watershed moment breaking with decasdes of previous policy, Spain, Ireland and Norway announced last week that the recognition would come into force on Tuesday. While the majority of UN member states recognize the state of Palestine, most EU states do not. Madrid/Tel Aviv (dpa) - Spain, Ireland and Norway formally recognized a Palestinian state on Tuesday in a coordinated effort denounced by Israel.The trio announced last week the recognition would come into force on Tuesday, a watershed moment that broke with decades of previous policy and showed the diplomatic chill Israel finds itself in.The act has powerful symbolic value given that most other Western European countries take the position that Palestinian statehood can only come after direct negotiations between the parties.Ireland""This decision of Ireland is about keeping hope alive. It is about believing that a two-state solution is the only way for Israel and Palestine to live side by side in peace and security,"" Irish Prime Minister Simon Harris said in a statement.""We had wanted to recognize Palestine at the end of a peace process however we have made this move alongside Spain and Norway to keep the miracle of peace alive.""The Irish government said full diplomatic relations between Dublin and Ramallah will be established. This includes appointing an an ambassador of Ireland to the state of Palestine.SpainIn Madrid, Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said Spain took the major step ""to help the Israelis and the Palestinians achieve peace.""He said it was not for Spain to decide the precise borders of another country's state, but that ""the West Bank and the Gaza Strip must be connected by a corridor, with East Jerusalem as its capital.""He said his government is opposed to the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and strongly condemns the attacks the militants launched on Israel on October 7. However, recognition is ""the only way to a two-state solution.""NorwayNorway began by formally recognizing an independent Palestine shortly after midnight.""For more than 30 years, Norway has been one of the strongest advocates for a Palestinian state. Today, when Norway officially recognizes Palestine as a state, is a milestone in the relationship between Norway and Palestine,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement.Eide said that the recognition was a clear expression of support for the moderate forces among Israelis and Palestinians. He also criticized Israel's approach the Palestinians. ""It is regrettable that the Israeli government shows no signs of engaging constructively.

The majority of  UN member countries have recognized a Palestinian state. Photo FENA/UN General AssemblyThe majority of United Nations member states recognize the state of Palestine. However, influential Western nations such as the United States, Britain, and most EU states do not.Denmark will not follow the example of Norway, Ireland and Spain and recognize Palestine as an independent state for the time being. The Danish parliament voted against such a bill on Tuesday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in response to an enquiry.A large majority in parliament denied the proposal. The bill was introduced in February by four left-wing parties, which were the only ones to vote in favour of the bill on Tuesday.Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz lashed out at the Spanish prime minister, writing on Tuesday on X that SÃ¡nchez was ""complicit in inciting the Jewish genocide and war crimes."" Katz was referring to a recent video in which Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Yolanda DÃ­az said Palestinians would be free ""from the river to the sea.""The slogan is considered anti-Semitic because it expresses the Palestinian claim to sovereignty from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, which would mean Israel does not exist. From the Israeli point of view, it is a call for the expulsion or killing of Jews in the state of Israel.Spain has long been one of the harshest critics in Europe of Israel's military action in the Gaza Strip. The left-wing government suspended all arms exports to Israel in October. It also recently decided to deny all cargo ships loaded with weapons for Israel entry to Spanish harbours in future.Momentum for recognizing Palestinian statehood has grown in several European countries as the war that began on October 7 with the Hamas attack on Israel, which left some 1,200 people dead and another 250 others taken hostage, drags on.Critics and allies of Israel have shown increasing frustration as the war continues to claim lives in Gaza amid mass displacement in the territory and worsening humanitarian conditions.The Hamas-run health authority says more than 36,000 people have been killed so far.",1
German government: Ukraine meets conditions for EU accession talks,"In December, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine. While the European Commission said in a recent report that the country needed to implement further reforms, the German government has now said that Ukraine has fulfilled these reforms.Brussels (dpa) – The German government has said that Ukraine has fulfilled the reform requirements necessary to initiate discussions about joining the European Union.""In the view of the German government, Ukraine fulfils all requirements to be able to open EU accession negotiations in June,"" German Minister of State for Europe Anna LÃ¼hrmann told dpa. ""We are therefore urging all member states to quickly agree on the negotiating framework,"" said LÃ¼hrmann, who is also a member of the Greens.In December last year, EU leaders  agreed to start accession negotiations with Ukraine and reaffirmed their commitment to continue providing strong support to the country and its people for as long as necessary.However, the most recent report from the European Commission revealed that Ukraine is falling short in implementing some reforms, especially in combating corruption and protecting minorities, which has led to the agreement that all reform requirements must be met before negotiations could begin.EU ambassadors plan to meet next week to discuss a potential negotiating framework. Hungary is seen as a potential obstacle.Ukraine, together with neighbouring Moldova, had applied to join the bloc in early 2022 in the wake of Russia's full-scale invasion. (30 May)",1
"EPP “not anymore a Christian Democratic force”, PES lead candidate Schmit says
","In an interview with the European Newsroom on Wednesday, the lead candidate of the Party of European Socialists (PES) found stern words for Commission President von der Leyenâ€™s European People's Party (EPP) and stressed the importance of showing voters an alternative to the far right. Shortly ahead of the European elections, Nicolas Schmit, PES lead candidate and European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, stressed that his party wants to show voters an alternative to the far right parties. In addition, the Luxembourg politician criticised the European People's Party for not excluding the possibility of cooperating with the extreme right after next weekâ€™s European elections, unlike other political groupings in the European Parliament.Â The EPP is â€œnot anymore a Christian Democratic forceâ€, but has become a conservative party open to cooperation with the extreme right, he told the European Newsroom (enr) on Wednesday.The EPP is the largest grouping in the European Parliament and the party of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen who is in the race for a second term.No room for hateful rhetoric The 70-year-old politician, satisfied with the course of the election campaign, is cautious but optimistic about his partyâ€™s result a week before the start of the European elections.â€œIf we keep the same [number of] seats, it will be fair, but I think we could still win a few more,â€ said Schmit, who is in the race to become the next European Commission president. The Socialists and Democrats (S&D) political group which represents PES in the European Parliament currently has 139 MEPs, making it the second largest.  The Social democrat declined, however, to reveal any of the pieces of his political familyâ€™s strategy for the renewal of the European Union's institutional leadership or the portfolios they hope to lead in the next Commission. He warned though of the â€œimbalanceâ€ that the second largest European party will have a minority number of commissioners because it does not form part of enough governments.With the election campaign drawing to a close, the Socialists will focus on showing voters that their party has ideas and projects in contrast to the far right. Further, Schmit said, it was necessary to inform the widest possible circle of voters not to support parties that promote hateful rhetoric.When asked about the recent attacks on Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico and German politicians he said that over the last years, there has been discourse of mainly – but not only – extreme right forces which does not respect â€œa certain level of dignityâ€. He added: â€œIf you see this kind of discourse developing, the next step will be physical violence and thatâ€™s where we are now.â€The Socialists, together with the Liberals, the Left and the Greens, recently condemned the violence in a joint statement and pledged not to cooperate with far-right parties after the elections. The EPP did not join this statement, and the leading candidate of this party, Ursula von der Leyen, does not exclude the possibility of cooperation with the extreme right. The fact that they didn't sign is a real shock for me. Nicolas Schmit, PES lead candidate and European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights â€œThe fact that they didnâ€™t sign is a real shock for me, because the Christian Democrats I know were among the fathers – and mothers, if I also take [former German chancellor] Angela Merkel in there – of the European integration process. Now they do not exclude alliances with those who are fundamentally against this project of Europe,â€ said Schmit.â€œThe EPP is not anymore the Christian democratic force that contributed to the deepening of integration. It has become a conservative party which does not exclude opening to the extreme right. This is a fact and this is a responsibility they take which is huge,â€ Schmit stated. Speaking to the European Newsroom, he added that Christian Democratic politicians such as Konrad Adenauer, first chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, and Alcide De Gasperi, first prime minister of the Italian Republic, must â€œturn in their gravesâ€. Both are regarded, among others, as founding fathers of the European Union.Giorgia Meloni, Italian Prime Minister. Speaking to the European Newsroom, PES lead candidate Schmit wondered whether she's a person to trust in sharing the same view on the future of Europe. Photo: Andrew Medichini/AP/dpaAll eyes on MeloniNicolas Schmit believes that there is no decent extreme right in the EU, as some describe the party of European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), headed by Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni. â€œMadame Meloni has, up until now, played a more moderate game in the [European] Council [..] but what she is doing in Italy shows that she is still the same, she has not changed,â€ he said, adding that â€œitâ€™s not this kind of transformation that – oh, now, Madame Meloni has become a great democrat and she has really broken with the fascist past of her party and herself.â€Schmit recalled that the Italian had said that she was bringing the revolution she was doing in Italy to Europe. He further warned that in Italy, Meloni has started with restrictions on abortion, controlling the public media and fewer rights for the LGTBIQ+ community.â€œSo, is this a person I can really trust to share the same fundamental view on the future of Europe? Itâ€™s to laugh [at],â€ said Schmit who later called Meloni a â€œwolf in sheep's clothingâ€. During the interview, Schmit also referred to the controversy over the migration agreements signed between the European Union and Tunisia to outsource the management of migration.He criticised the fact that, beyond the questionable content, von der Leyen gave the members of the Commission only an hour on a Friday afternoon to give their opinion on the pact. â€œMadame Meloni was better informed than me,â€ said Schmit.EU Enlargement: Focus on process itself rather than specific dates Further steps in the process of expansion to the East and the Western Balkans can also be expected in the upcoming legislative period of the EU. Schmit emphasised the importance of focusing on the enlargement process itself rather than setting specific dates for countries to become members, as this could create unrealistic expectations and potential disappointments. The Commissioner said that he was hoping the process could be accelerated and managed better, adding that the Commission had made proposals for the enlargment process which should â€œbe more dynamic, more step by step, more progressiveâ€.On the subject of EU membership candidate Georgia, who recently passed a controversial legislation on foreign influence, Schmit said that the country should not be prevented from entering the Union. However, it must be made clear that the adoption of this law is not in line with the efforts for EU membership. â€œGeorgia shows clearly what geopolitical situation we are [in]. It also shows very clearly that Russia has not given up to dominate, to create turmoil and to limit the sovereignty of what Russia considers its close neighbourhood,â€ Schmit said further.Schmit: Israeli response to Hamas attacks â€œdisproportionateâ€When asked about the current situation in Israel and Gaza, Schmit called not â€œto question what happened on October 7 which has been a terrible crimeâ€ while acknowledging that the Israeli response is â€œabsolutely disproportionateâ€. He pointed out that in addition to not respecting international law, it even goes beyond war law.Regarding this weekâ€™s trip to Israel by European Commissioner for Enlargement Oliver VÃ¡rhelyi, Schmit said that â€œcontinuing to talk, to visit and to exchange is always importantâ€. He added that â€œit's not by silence that you will reach anythingâ€.This article is published weekly.

"Interview with Nicolas Schmit, socialist lead candidate for the EU electionsÂ ","On Wednesday, 29 May, the European Newsroom spoke to Nicolas Schmit, lead candidate for the Party of European Socialists (PES) in the upcoming European elections and European Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights.As the 2024 European elections are just around the corner, the European Newsroom sat down with the Luxembourgish commissioner to talk about his campaign and his outlook for the next months.Schmit made no secret of his criticism of the European People's Party led by current Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, which did not rule out the possibility of cooperating with the extreme right. The EPP is â€œnot anymore a Christian Democratic forceâ€, but has become a conservative party open to cooperation with the extreme right, he told the enr.Â Asked about enlargement of the bloc to include countries like Ukraine, Georgia and countries in the Western Balkans, Schmit emphasised the importance of focusing on the process itself, rather than setting specific dates for countries to become members. According to him, this could create unrealistic expectations and potential disappointments.When asked about the current situation in Israel and Gaza, Schmit called not â€œto question what happened on October 7 which has been a terrible crimeâ€ while acknowledging that the Israeli response is â€œabsolutely disproportionateâ€.The interview was conducted by journalists from three news agencies participating in the enr: ANSA (Italy,) EFE (Spain) and STA (Slovenia). Other participating agencies followed the interview online, among them AFP (France), Agerpres (Romania), AMNA (Greece), Europa Press (Spain), HINA (Croatia) and Tanjug (Serbia).As a result, a number of them covered the interview by publishing news items on their respective wires.Following the interview, the enr jointly produced a Key Story, based on the news reporting by the respective agencies participating in the enr.

German defence minister visits EU-candidate Moldova in show of support against Russia,"German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius visited Moldova on Friday against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. Moldova has been a candidate for EU membership since June 2022. However, Russia still has considerable influence in the country.ChiÈ™inÄƒu (dpa) – On Friday, German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius visited Eastern European country Moldova against the backdrop of the Russian invasion of neighbouring Ukraine.He was received with military honours by his Moldovan counterpart Anatolie NosatÃ®i in the capital city ChiÈ™inÄƒu. Afterwards, Pistorius was scheduled to visit a barracks which forms part of German development projects to make the country more resilient in the face of Moscow's attempts at destabilisation.Pistorius was also to be shown several armoured transport vehicles paid for by Germany. The German government has also provided the country with medical equipment.Moldova's pro-European President Maia Sandu wants to push ahead with the country's integration into the European Union. The country has been an a candidate for EU accession after being granted the status in June 2022.At the same time, however, Russia continues to have great influence in the economically poor former Soviet republic, which has around 2.5 million inhabitants. Russian soldiers have been stationed in the breakaway region of Transnistria since the 1990s.There are renewed fears that Moscow could use unrest in the region as a pretext for escalation in the wake of its war against Ukraine.

Germany eases access for non-EU jobseekers,"Germany has introduced a new visa scheme for non-EU workers in an attempt to tackle an acute shortage of skilled labour in the country. In the European Union, the so-called EU Blue Card allows workers from non-EU countries to live and work in the bloc.Berlin (dpa) – On Saturday, Germany enacted a new visa scheme for skilled workers from outside the European Union that enables applicants to move to the country and look for a job for up to a year if they meet certain criteria.The new visa scheme is part of an extensive package of legislation aimed at tackling Germany's acute shortage of skilled labour. The first stage came into force in November 2023 and mainly included easing the way to a residency permit known as the EU Blue Card and for recognised skilled workers. The EU Blue Card allows non-EU citizens to live and work in the EU – similar to the Green Card in the United States – provided they meet certain qualifications.The new scheme in Germany, known as the job search opportunity card, is open to those with at least two years of vocational training or a university degree recognised by the country where the qualification was obtained. Knowledge of German or English is also required.Whether an applicant is eligible for the visa will be calculated based on their language skills, professional experience, age and ties to Germany. Once the card has been granted, applicants are able to enter Germany and search for a job for up to a year.That means participants are no longer required to present a contract with a German company before being able to enter Germany. They also don't have to present a qualification recognised by or obtained in Germany. This is intended to reduce bureaucracy and shorten procedures.""We are ensuring that workers and skilled workers that our economy has urgently needed for years can come to our country,"" German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said on Saturday.From Saturday, opportunities for jobseekers from the Western Balkans have also been expanded, including for non-skilled workers. However, a contract with a German company is still required under this scheme as a precondition to enter Germany. (1 June)",1
"Far-right on course for gains in 2024 European elections, polls show","Recent polls show that in the upcoming European Parliament elections, far-right parties across the EU are set to gain voters â€“ hence increasing their presence in the hemicycle. What are their views on the EU and how would this affect the functioning of the bloc after the elections?Between 6 and 9 June, around 370 million Europeans are called to the polls for what promises to be the most important election in the history of the EU. Internally, however, Europe deals with interference from Moscow and the rise of sovereignist, nationalist and extremist movements that could challenge the way the EU functions.For months, the far-right – often, but not exclusively, seen as the most critical of the EU – has been in constant growth in many EU member states, according to pre-election opinion polls. The latest projections on the composition of the European Parliament show that the majority that supported current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in 2019 – the EPP, The Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and Renew Europe – will hold their ground, although with a significantly thinner margin.Parties across Europe belonging to the Identity and Democracy (ID) group – which houses some of Europeâ€™s far-right parties – are expected to gain voters. The group includes Franceâ€™s National Rally party (RN), Belgiumâ€™s Vlaams Belang (VB), Italyâ€™s Lega (LSP), Austriaâ€™s Freedom Party (FPÃ–) and the Netherlandsâ€™ Party for Freedom (PVV), all of which are doing well in the national polls.Until recently, the German Alternative for Germany (AfD) also sat with ID. However, as of May 23, the AfD delegation has been expelled from ID with immediate effect. Their expulsion is expected to eat into the groupâ€™s overall gains, but MEPs representing the AfD would still join the Parliament as non-attached members. The European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) are also expected to gain seats, due to the predicted rise of the Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloniâ€™s Brothers of Italy (FdI) party.The Greens, the Liberals in the Renew Europe group and the Socialists and Democrats may emerge diminished from the polls.According to projections from Europe Elects in May, the Greens are at 56 seats compared to 74 in 2019 , the S&D at 138 compared to 154 in 2019 and Renew at 86 compared to 108 in 2019. The ID group is at 68 seats compared to 73 in 2019 and the ECR at 75 compared to 62 in 2019. According to the projections, the EPP remains stable at 180 seats compared to 182 in 2019. The number of non-attached MEPs – including AfD members who would otherwise have been included in the ID group – is expected to rise to 76 compared to 57 in 2019. EU-critical parties envision a different European UnionWhile â€˜United in diversityâ€™ has been the Unionâ€™s motto since 2000, multiple countries – or rather right-leaning parties – have toyed with the idea of leaving the EU and have been championing more nationalist ideals, resulting in campaigns for Frexit, Dexit, Nexit, Polexit and more.In Germany, the AfD had been doing well in the polls amid dissatisfaction with Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition, but support had dropped considerably after a series of scandals – including allegations that it plans to repatriate migrants. The AfD wants to partially reverse European integration. In its view, the EU should only be an economic and interest group of loosely connected individual states.Germany would suffer severe economic damage if it left the European Union, researchers from the German Economic Institute (IW) wrote in a report in May. An exit from the EU, the economists wrote in their analysis, ""would deliberately trigger a severe economic crisis and a lasting loss of prosperity for the population in Germany.""The leader of the French far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen (l) and the party's lead candidate for the upcoming European elections, Jordan Bardella (r), applaud during a meeting in Henin-Beaumont, northern France. Photo: Michel Euler/AP/dpaIn France, the lead candidate for the European elections of the National Rally party, 28-year-old MEP Jordan Bardella, has become extremely popular in the country – especially among young voters. Bardella is very critical on migration and has voiced opposition to the accession of new countries to the EU, such as Ukraine. The National Rally party also advocates for restrictions on the EUâ€™s Schengen zone.In Spain, Vox is the only party in the European Parliament that belongs to a Eurosceptic political family – the ECR. Although Vox has always avoided defining itself as a Eurosceptic party, focusing on the defence of an EU that respects the national sovereignty of its member states, several of the party's postulates do question some of the pillars on which the EU is based.Vox has also adopted a very critical line with the climate and environmental policies promoted by the EU, which it blames for harming farmers and ranchers.Internal cracks divide European groupsAs the far-right has gained ground in EU member statesâ€™ national politics, the pressure on relations within groups or parties at the European level has also increased.While the ID group also housed Germanyâ€™s Alternative for Germany (AfD), the party was expelled from the group in May following incidents involving its lead candidate for the European elections, Maximilian Krah. Krah commented that not all members of the Schutzstaffel (SS) were criminals. The SS was a major paramilitary organisation under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party.Following the incident, the National Rally party (RN) was the first to explicitly announce that it would no longer cooperate with the AfD in the European Parliament.Renew lead candidate Valerie Hayer at a press briefing of the Renew Europe Group in the European Parliament. Strasbourg, 12 March 2024. Photo: picture alliance / Panama Pictures Furthermore, in an interview with the European Newsroom in April, Renew Europe's lead candidate, ValÃ©rie Hayer, said that she ruled out a coalition with the ECR.Following the recent coalition agreement in the Netherlands, Hayer also announced that the country's liberal Peopleâ€™s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) membership of the group would be put to the vote. The VVD entered into a four-way coalition with Geert Wilders' far-right populist Party for Freedom (PVV) – which is part ofÂ  the ID group in the European Parliament –, the centre-right New Social Contract (NSC) and the agrarian right-wing Farmer-Citizen Movement (BBB). According to Hayer, the VVD no longer belongs to the Renew group after forming a coalition with the PVV.While the PVV is part of the ID group, it currently has no seats in the European Parliament.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Anti-EU currents.

"“Le Compromis”: AFP launched podcast about European Parliament
","European Newsroom member agency AFP has launched a podcast ahead of the 2024 European elections, focusing on the EUâ€™s directive on companiesâ€™ responsibility to respect human rights and the environment worldwide.On 17 May, Agence France-Presse (AFP) – a member of the European Newsroom – launched a podcast about the European Parliament entitled â€œLe Compromisâ€. The podcast looks into the EUâ€™s Corporate Sustainability and Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD).From June 6, Europeans choose their representatives in the European Parliament. This is one of the most important elections of the year worldwide. And for a good reason: European laws have an impact in 27 states and can change the world. For two years, journalist and producer Yann Ollivier immersed himself behind the scenes of the European parliament, to understand how they are made. Together with filmmaker Fanny Tondre, he followed the path of a crucial law, the corporate due diligence directive. This law obliges multinationals active in Europe to respect human rights and the environment worldwide.Â The story of its adoption was strewn with pitfalls, emotion, and sleepless nights, and it is worthy of the best political series. The story is told in podcast format in five episodes. In this series, Yann Ollivier follows the fight of the three women who defended this law in the European Parliament: rapporteur Lara Wolters and her co-negotiators Manon Aubry and Heidi Hautala.Â You can listen to the podcast here. It is also available on Spotify, Apple Podcasts and Deezer .More information about the podcast:Authors: Yann Ollivier and Fanny Tondre, with the participation of James KanterÂ Interviews: Yann Ollivier and Fanny Tondre, with the participation of James KanterEditing and production: Emmanuelle Giry and RÃ©gis DieboldÂ Mixing: RÃ©gis DieboldÂ Music: Charlie Nguyen KimÂ Editorial supervision: Julien GiraultÂ Editor-in-chief: MichaÃ«la Cancela-KiefferÂ This AFP Audio podcast is taken from the investigation carried out by the team of the film Le Compromis, broadcast by Arte, co-produced by FACTSTORY and ZADIG Productions.Â ",1
EU gears up for crucial European Parliament elections,"From Thursday to Sunday, voters across the European Union will go to the polls to elect the next members of the European Parliament. Campaigns are in full swing and the far right is expected to gain ground in the Parliament â€“ but in some member states, national issues appear to be taking centre stage.From Thursday to Sunday, June 6-9, some 370 million voters are called to the polls in the 27 European Union member states to elect the next 720 members for the European Parliament. The outcome of these elections will also help determine the composition of the next European Commission, whose current chief Ursula von der Leyen is hoping for a second term.The latest polls and projections show that the far right is poised to make significant gains in the European Parliament, with parties once on the fringes now growing in influence in the EU. Overall, however, Europeâ€™s political centre is expected to hold.With the start of the elections just one day away, election campaigns across the bloc are on the home stretch – but in some countries, the EU-wide vote is being overshadowed by national issues grabbing votersâ€™ attention.Far right set for gainsThe election is widely predicted to see a surge for extreme-right lawmakers, according to opinion polls that predict the two main far-right factions – the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and the Identity and Democracy (ID) group – winning around a quarter of the seats in the next Parliament.A backlash against climate change policies, rising migration, economic uncertainty, and anti-establishment anger are among a myriad of reasons put forward by analysts to explain the far-right surge.Already at the start of the year, the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) predicted a â€œsharp right turnâ€ with anti-EU parties winning in nine EU countries, including Belgium, Italy and France. In the Netherlands, Geert Wildersâ€™ far-right populist Party for Freedom (PVV) formed a coalition with three other parties last month after winning the general election in November.â€œToday there is room to build a different majority in the European Parliament, and for different policies,â€ said Italian prime minister and the leader of the right-wing Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, Giorgia Meloni, last week. At the EU level, FdI is part of the ECR group, of which Meloni is also president. Last week, she said she had several things in common with Marine Le Pen, the leader of Franceâ€™s right-wing National Rally (RN), which is part of the Identity and Democracy (ID) group.â€œIt is clear that there are points in common,â€ Meloni told the Trento Economy Festival. â€œThere are points of contact on combating illegal immigration, on the approach to the Green transition, on defence of the European identityâ€.The leader of the French far-right National Rally party, Marine Le Pen (l), and the party's lead candidate for the upcoming European elections, Jordan Bardella (r), stand together during a campaign event. Photo: Thomas Padilla/AP/dpaA bumpy ride in FranceFranceâ€™s far-right National Rally (RN) party holds a commanding lead for upcoming European Parliament elections, according to an opinion poll published on Sunday, June 2. The poll was conducted among 1,803 people between May 29 and 31.The extreme-right RNâ€™s lead candidate, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, is credited with 32.5 percent of voting intentions in the poll. ValÃ©rie Hayer, lead candidate for the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament and an ally of centre-right President Emmanuel Macron, came second with 16 percent, followed by centre-left socialist candidate RaphaÃ«l Glucksmann with 13 percent.Domestically in France, the election campaign has seen some bumps in the road in recent days.On Monday, 35-year-old Prime Minister Gabriel Attal faced accusations of deliberately seeking to eclipse Hayer in European elections when he unexpectedly appeared on a stage where she was taking part in a radio debate. Attal had already faced similar accusations last month when he, not Hayer, took part in a televised TV debate with Jordan Bardella.National issues steer attentionIn Spain, the latest pre-election survey by the Center for Sociological Research (CIS) predicted a victory for the Spanish Socialist Workersâ€™ Party (PSOE), but most other polls predict that the countryâ€™s conservative Peopleâ€™s Party (PP) will win the elections. However, the leaders of the main political parties focus on the countryâ€™s internal issues – such as the Amnesty law for the withdrawal of legal actions against several Catalan separatists and corruption cases – resulting in little attention for the European Parliament elections. Meanwhile, Portugal grapples with fears of low turnout. It is one of the EU countries that allows early voting, which was reinforced this year in an attempt by the Portuguese authorities to encourage people to vote. Many Portuguese went to the polls several days early last Sunday, following the countryâ€™s worst abstention rate during the 2019 elections, when around 69 percent of eligible people didnâ€™t vote. This was the worst rate since joining the EU in 1986. Slovenia will hold three referendums at the same time as the European elections, including on assisted voluntary end-of-life and legalisation of cannabis. In addition, the process of recognising Palestinian statehood was underway just before the elections. As a result, European issues have not received as much attention as they would otherwise have. On Tuesday night, the Slovenian parliament formally approved the recognition, making Slovenia the latest European country to do so after Spain, Ireland and Norway.Government parties in Slovenia had hoped that the simultaneous referendums would increase turnout in the European elections. A poll commissioned by national daily newspaper Delo last Friday showed that 39 percent would turn up to vote, ten percentage points more than in the previous EU election, and altogether a higher turnout than in any EU election in Slovenia so far.In Slovakia, the attack on pro-Russia Prime Minister Robert Fico has shaken up the campaign and could boost support for his populist coalition.In Poland, where Donald Tuskâ€™s pro-EU government came to power at the end of 2023, the campaign remained marked by the angry farmers, supported by the right-wing nationalist opposition party Law and Justice (PiS).Migration on votersâ€™ mindsEU voters, according to surveys, are weighing up issues spanning from the war in Ukraine, economic prospects, trade protectionism including with the United States and the risk of artificial intelligence (AI) to jobs, migration, and also climate change.In Austria, for example, according to a survey by the Austrian Society for European Politics which surveyed 5,400 people, a uniform EU migration and asylum policy (56 percent) and reducing the gap between the rich and the poor (55 percent) are among the highest priorities for citizens. In the Czech Republic, far-right populist groups such as Freedom and Direct Democracy (Svoboda a pÅ™Ã­mÃ¡ demokracie, or SPD) have succeeded in making the topic of migration a major issue in this election as well. It claims that the government negotiated a bad Migration and Asylum Pact for the Czech Republic and thus invited migrants to Europe and to the Czech Republic.ANO 2011, the party of former Prime Minister Andrej BabiÅ¡ which is part of the Renew Europe group in the European Parliament, has gradually become one of the most vocal critics of the EU. It strongly opposes the EU Green Deal and the recently adopted Migration and Asylum Pact. According to polls in May, ANO 2011 is set to win the elections with 23,1 percent of the vote.The flag of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Photo: FENA/Harun MuminoviÄ‡Voting in the EU neighbourhoodWhile European countries that are not a member of the EU cannot vote in the European Parliament elections, in some countries, campaigns are still held. An example is Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). On June 9, Croatian citizens in BiH will elect twelve MEPs from 300 candidates and 25 lists. The elections will be held at seven locations across the country.BiH doesnâ€™t have its own representatives in the European Parliament because it is not a member of the EU, but the policy of Croatian representatives is often focused on advocating for EU enlargement and other issues important to BiH, especially since Croats live in the country as a constituent people.However, Slovenian, Polish and Romanian citizens will not be able to vote in the European Parliament elections in BiH, because the government did not give its consent after opposition from ministers of Serbian nationality. In Ljubljana, this decision was described as unacceptable and the Foreign Ministry summoned the interim Bosnian charge dâ€™affaires in Slovenia to express its protest.This article is published weekly.

"“Foreign agent law”: Is Georgia turning its back on the EU?
","Georgia has been an EU accession candidate since 2023 and citizensâ€™ support for accession recently polled at 89 percent. With a newÂ  Russian-style â€œforeign agent lawâ€ the EU path of the Caucasus country just got rockier.On May 28, the Georgian parliament voted on the adoption of the so-called foreign agent law despite heavy criticism from the opposition, thousands of protesters on Georgian streets as well as stern words from the European Union. Georgiaâ€™s pro-Western President Salome Zurabishvili had previously vetoed the law but was overruled by a simple majority in parliament. On Monday, the bill was signed into law and has now taken effect. The governing nationalist Georgian Dream party, which holds the majority in parliament, is using the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence to tighten the accountability of non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20 per cent of their funding from abroad. It justifies the law as making for greater transparency in the foreign funding of non-governmental organisations and boosting Georgian sovereignty.Online registration of non-governmental organisations is to begin in two months, with fines imposed for infringements. Organisations that fail to register will have their assets confiscated, according to Tbilisi Mayor Kakha Kaladze. They will then be shut down.Many organisations say they will refuse to comply and will take their case to the constitutional court and the European Court of Human Rights. Georgia joined the Council of Europe in 1999 and is subject to the European convention on Human Rights.The pro-Western opposition criticises the law as â€œRussianâ€ and fears political repression similar to that in the neighbouring country. The European Union granted Georgia candidate status in late 2023. In light of the recent developments, EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell and the European Commission said the law represented a backslide on Georgiaâ€™s EU path. The US, holding long-standing relations with Georgia, also announced to review travel policies and their bilateral relations. However, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze explained that Georgia's goal remains to join the European Union by 2030. Sanctions or penalties do not frighten the ruling party because it acts in the interests of the people and is elected, he said. Thousands protest against Russian-style â€œagentâ€ law For weeks, tens of thousands in the former Soviet state have joined protests in the capital Tbilisi against the legislation. Critics accuse the Georgian government of having modelled the planned law on a Russian ""agent"" law in order to hinder the work of independent associations and media.In Russia, numerous organisations and individuals are branded as ""foreign agents,"" a classification that often causes major problems. The controversial law was introduced in 2012 and is said to stigmatise and politically persecute recipients of payments from abroad, including human rights activists, journalists and artists.26.05.2024, Georgia, Tbilisi: Georgian President Salome Zurabichvili and Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze (l) during the Independence Day celebrations. Photo: Irakli Gedenidze/Pool Reuters/AP/dpa Spat: PM says law good for â€œsovereigntyâ€, president says it deters from EU path Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has accused President Salome Zurabishvili of ""betrayal"" for her veto of the law.""â€œIt was the unity and reasonable steps of the people and their elected government that gave us the opportunity to maintain peace in the country for the past two years despite existential threats and multiple betrayals, including the betrayal of the president of Georgia"", Kobakhidze stated in a speech given on the Day of Georgian Independence – from the former USSR – which is celebrated on May 26.But the president, too, found stark words for the prime minister, stating that â€œpartnership and rapprochement with Europe are the true path to preserving and strengthening our independence and peaceâ€ and further adding that â€œthose who sabotage and undermine this path trample upon and damage the peaceful and secure future of our country, hindering the path towards becoming a full member of the free and democratic world.â€After her overruled veto, the pro-Western president and former French diplomat Zurabishvili had refused to sign it into law. On Monday, Georgiaâ€™s parliamentary president Shalva Papuashvili, a member of nationalist Georgian Dream, signed the measure into law. Zurabishvili has called on the demonstrators to focus their energy on collecting signatures for a referendum against the law. At the same time, she reminded them that a new parliament would be elected in the Black Sea republic on 26 October and that the people had the chance to get rid of the current government.Support for EU membership among Georgians is high: According to a nation-wide poll, 89 percent of Georgians either â€œfully supportâ€ or â€œsomewhat supportâ€ the joining of the European Union when asked in March. Three steps backwards on the Georgian EU pathPro-European forces criticise the law as a step backwards on the road to the EU: The European Union has announced consequences following the final adoption of the law that is set to tighten control over civil society in the candidate country. Washington, too, announced consequences such as visa bans and â€œcomprehensive review of all U.S.-Georgia cooperationâ€.""The EU has stressed repeatedly that the law adopted by the Georgian Parliament goes against EU core principles and values,"" said EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell and the EU Commission in a statement on May 28. Specifically, the statement criticises the fact that the new law â€œleads to a backslidingâ€ in at least three of nine areas that are important for the EU accession process. These are the fight against the polarisation of society and disinformation as well as progress in fundamental rights and the involvement of civil society organisations.With regard to the protests against the law in Georgia, Borrell and the EU Commission stated: ""We continue to stand with the Georgian people and recognise the choice of [an] overwhelming majority of them for a European future for their country.""The EU and the US have been funding civil society development projects in Georgia on a large scale for a long time. The associated communication of Western values of freedom and sexual self-determination, for example, runs counter to conservative forces in society, which is heavily influenced by the Georgian Orthodox Church.No â€œforeign agentâ€ law in Bosnia and Herzegovina but in KyrgyzstanIn Bosnia and Herzegovina, another EU accession candidate, the Republika Srpska (RS) authorities have recently abolished their proposed â€œforeign agentâ€ law – which has also drawn  criticism by the EU. In September 2023, the law had previously been adopted in a first reading in the RS entity assembly.President of the Republika Srpska in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Milorad Dodik, stated on his X that the withdrawal was also due to RSâ€™s commitment to the European path. https://twitter.com/MiloradDodik/status/1795540745346035901The majority-serb territory of Republika Srpska is one of two entities in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bosnian-Serb leader Dodik has met with Russian President Vladimir Putin on numerous occasions since Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine, awarding Putin with the highest medal of honour for his â€œpatriotic concern and loveâ€ for RS in early 2023. Russia has been accused of strategically supporting Dodikâ€™s separatist policies to exploit divisions between the three main ethnic groups in the country. A ""foreign agents"" law was passed in Kyrgyzstan, another former Soviet republic, in late March.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: Anti-EU currents.

"EU citizens increasingly attached to the Union, major study finds","A study conducted by two German universities with data from the 27 member states of the European Union between 1991 and 2023 shows that support for the EU has increased across all generations and age groups.Frankfurt (dpa) – Citizens of the European Union feel increasingly attached to the Union, a new report by two German universities has suggested. Voters across the bloc are heading to the polls this week to vote for the European Parliament elections.The joint study by two German institutions, the Saarland University and the Philipps University of Marburg, showed a clear trend of increasing support for the EU, based off data from 600,000 respondents to the Eurobarometer public opinion survey from across the 27 member states between 1991 and 2023.In the report, published in the Journal of European Public Policy, EU citizens rated their attachment to the Union on a scale of 1 to 4.The study demonstrated that support for the EU has risen across all generations and age groups. Younger people – sometimes believed to be more supportive of the EU, having benefited from exchange programmes like Erasmus+ as well as greater travel opportunities – were not clear outliers.Major challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine strengthened cohesion within the EU, the results suggested, although the eurozone crisis following the global financial crash did lead to a downturn in attitudes towards the union.

Overall, the vote saw the EPP come first but also saw gains by far-right parties.Final results in France and Germany saw the far right make major gains while preliminary results in Italy also reported an increase in support, according to data from the European Parliament.Von der Leyen repeated her intention to seek support from the liberals and centre-left parties in the EU legislature to form a majority to approve her reappointment. She notably did not seek support from more extreme right wing parties.On the campaign trail, the commission president drew criticism for not ruling out cooperation with them, in particular with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's nationalist Brothers of Italy (FdI) party, which came out on top in the EU-wide vote at home.As the new parliament takes shape, EU leaders are set for a summit next Monday to weigh up the results and decide whether to reappoint von der Leyen for a second term. This is the vital first step that requires a qualified majority.Only three large EU member states need to vote in favour of von der Leyen for her to to achieve the necessary support, for example, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez and France's Emmanuel Macron.The EPP won 186 seats in the European Parliament, according to the latest provisional results from the EU legislature, making it the largest group by a comfortable margin, followed by the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) on 135.Liberal parties however fell from 102 seats to 79 seats while Green parties are also projected to lose a large number of European Parliament seats, down from 71 to 53.

EU top court: Women who value equality with men may qualify as refugees,"In a case involving two teenage Iraqi girls, the European Court of Justice has ruled that asylum seekers who support the value of equality between men and women can qualify for refugee status if their beliefs are a reason for persecution in their home country.Brussels (dpa) – Female asylum-seekers who believe in equality between the sexes may qualify as refugees if that is likely to be a ""motive for persecution"" in their home country, the European Union's top court ruled on Tuesday.The case concerns two teenage Iraqi girls whose initial applications for asylum in the Netherlands were rejected. They then applied again, arguing that they had adopted western customs during their long stay in the country. Their applications were rejected again, so they went to court.The EU Court of Justice, based in Luxembourg, ruled on Tuesday that women and girls who ""identify with the fundamental value of equality between women and men"" may qualify for refugee status if the conditions in their home country make that a ""motive for persecution.""The court also said that ""a long stay in a member state, especially when it coincides with a period during which an applicant minor has forged his or her identity,"" has to be taken into account when determining whether they're at risk of persecution for adopting western values.The judges added that where an asylum-seeker is a minor, EU countries have to ""determine concretely the best interests for that minor as part of an individual assessment.""As the Court of Justice is the EU's highest court, the judgement is final and cannot be appealed.

Post-Election EU: Looking at results and reactions,"The European elections came and went â€“ and with them all kinds of emotions across the political spectrum. While the pro-Europeans remain the strongest group in the European Parliament, the far-right gained ground. So much that French President Macron called for snap elections of the National Assembly.Â Voters across the EU over the weekend have voted for 720 members of the European Parliament.  Though centrist mainstream parties kept an overall majority in the European Parliament, extreme right parties across the bloc notched a string of high-profile wins. After record results in 2019, the Liberals and Greens have lost seats. European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP): 186 seats, +10Socialists and Democrats (S&D): 135 seats, -4 Renew Europe: 79 seats, -23European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR): 73 seats, +4Identity and Democracy (ID): 58 seats, +9 Greens/European Free Alliance: 53 seats, -18The Left: 36 seats, -1 Non-attached Members (NI): 45 seats, -17Newly elected members, unaffiliated as of now: 55 seatsDisclaimer: Provisional results via the European Parliament, 11/06/2024, 17:52. In comparison to the outgoing parliament. â€œDemocracy is alive,â€ European Parliament President Roberta Metsola stressed as she spoke from the stage of the Parliamentâ€™s hemicycle set up as a press room during election night to more than 1,000 present journalists.According to the projections, the majority composed of the centre-right EPP, Socialists and liberal Renew stands at around 400 seats, with a rather clear margin compared to the minimum threshold of 360. Theoretically, these three pro-EU parties can do without any external support:Their coalition has been dubbed the â€œUrsula majorityâ€ throughout the last legislative period. â€œWe will build a bastion against the extremes from the left and from the right,â€ vowed European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, whose European Peopleâ€™s Party secured its place as strongest force, and who herself is looking for a second term as Commission president. Major gains for far-right in Germany, France; Meloni strong in ItalyPrior to the elections, a shift to the right in European politics has been predicted. The elections have shown that more voters than previously have given their vote to far-right parties than before.Strongest force: France, (RN; 31,4%), Austria (FPÃ–, 25.4%), Italy (FdI, 28.8%), Hungary (Fidesz, 44,8%), Belgium (VB, 22,94%)Second strongest force: Germany (AfD, 15,9%), Poland (PiS, 36,2%), Netherlands (PVV, 17.7%), Romania (AUR, 14.9%)Third strongest force: Spain (VOX; 9,6%), Portugal (Chega, 9.8%), Slovakia (Republika,12.5%)   Disclaimer: Numbers are preliminary and are based on European Parliament numbers via dpa-Infocom, latest update on June 12, 9:43 AM. The numbers for Belgium via IBZ.In Italy, where slightly less than half of the eligible voters cast their ballot, Giorgia Meloniâ€™s far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI) won the election with 28.8 percent of the votes. The prime ministerâ€™s party surpassed their national election result of 2022, when the FdI won 26 percent, strengthening Meloniâ€™s stance both domestically and on the EU level. In France, the far-right has massively outperformed President Macronâ€™s alliance led by his Renaissance party. Raking in 31.4 percent, Marine Le Penâ€™s Rassemblement National (RN) scored its best results ever, compared to 14.6 percent of Macronâ€™s centrist alliance led by his Renaissance party. The results are a blow for Macron who has long portrayed himself as a bulwark against the far right in Europe.Subsequently, the French president called a high-risk national legislative election. France will go to the polls to vote for a new National Assembly on June 30, with a second round on July 7, Macron said in an address to the nation.Contrary to France, the German government has dismissed calls for an early election due to the coalition partiesâ€™ losses in the elections. German Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s – consisting of his party, the Social Democrats, as well as the Greens and the Liberals – secured less than a third of the vote combined (31 percent). The Social Democratic Party saw its worst results yet in a National election. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) received nearly 16 percent of the vote, coming in second. The opposition alliance CDU/CSU (Conservatives) came in first place with 30 percent.Â In the Czech Republic, the opposition also won. The ANO movement gained over 26 percent of the votes. The win showcased votersâ€™ dissatisfaction with their current government in a record-turnout European election.Losses for the far-right in Portugal and Sweden While the far-right gained ground in the elections in some places, prominently in EU key players France and Germany, election results in Sweden and Portugal dealt a blow to far right parties.In Portugal, the far-right Chega party received 9.8 percent of votes. After making a splash in the legislative elections three months ago with 18 percent, it has failed to achieve the goal of electoral victory which its leader had mapped out on the campaign trail. The Swedish Democrats (ECR) lost support for the first time since their national breakthrough 15 years ago, coming in with a two-percent-loss at 13,2 percent. The far-right party is the second biggest in Swedenâ€™s national parliament but only secured fourth place in the EU elections. One of the reasons for their performance could be that the traditional Swedish Democrats voter does not care much about the European elections. No unity in the far-right movements, limiting their weightWhile all share anti-immigrant platforms, divisions run deep between those wanting to keep up Europeâ€™s role helping Ukraine in its fight against Russiaâ€™s invasion, such as Meloniâ€™s party, and those leery of it, which include Le Penâ€™s RN.â€œThe voices of the extreme right and the populist right cannot be added together, this will limit their direct weight in the legislature,â€ Sebastien Maillard, of the Jacques Delors Institute think tank, told French news agency AFP.â€œBut the brown (far-right) wave, particularly evident in France, will inevitably permeate the political climate in which the Commission will act and the majority will have to take it into account,â€ he added.The voter turnout in the EU stands at more than 50 percent. However, some countries have seen a low turnout that is credited to election fatigue or the fact that the European elections are not as important to citizens as national ones. Photo: Jan Woitas/dpaElection fatigue possible cause for low participationAccording to preliminary numbers by the European Parliament, the voter turnout stands at 51.01 percent which is a slight uptick compared to the 50.66 percent in the 2019 elections. In some member states, multiple elections or referendums were held simultaneously to the European elections – such as in Belgium or Slovenia.The lowest voter turnout has been recorded in Croatia with 21.34 percent, even lower than the already low turnout of 29.85 percent in 2019. Lithuania (28.35 percent) is the only other EU country with a voter turnout lower than 30 percent. Low voter turnout in Croatia is attributed to the recent parliamentary elections, likely leaving the public fed up with both elections and respective campaigns. In addition, the public considers European elections less important than those at the National level.Bulgaria, where voter turnout was also low (33.79 percent), held two-in-one elections, voting for members of the European as well as the National Parliament – for the sixth time in three years. Ingrid Shikova, EU policies professor at Sofiaâ€™s St Kliment Ohridski University, told Bulgarian news agency BTA that there were no major surprises in the European Parliament elections in Bulgaria. â€œWhat we lost from the fact that National and European elections were held simultaneously was that our National problems somehow overshadowed the European ones,â€ she said.In Slovenia however, the voter turnout exceeded 41 percent which is twelve percentage points higher than in 2019 and marks the highest turnout since 2004. The simultaneous vote on three consultative referendums on assisted dying, preferential vote in a general election and cannabis use probably contributed to the turnout.In Belgium, where three elections – Federal, National, European – were held at the same time and voting is mandatory, the voter turnout of 89.82 percent marks the highest among the EU-27. The EUâ€™s hiring: What are the next steps?The heads of State and Government of the European Union will meet informally on June 17 for a dinner in Brussels. During the dinner, they will discuss distribution of the EUâ€™s top jobs – the presidency of the European Commission, the European Council, the European Parliament as well as the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy – for the first time.At the end of the month, on June 27 and 28, the heads of state of the EU  will hold a two-day summit with the goal of reaching an agreement on how the above-mentioned positions will be distributed. This article is published weekly.

European tourism industry on post-pandemic road to recovery,"As the summer season approaches, tourists will soon be flocking to Europeâ€™s popular hotspots. Recent data shows that the tourism industry stabilised itself after a sharp decline during the Covid-19 pandemic. On the negative side, mass tourism and overcrowding continue to put pressure on local societies.After the slump of the Covid-19 pandemic, the tourism industry across Europe continued to pick up speed in 2023 and 2024, drawing close to or – in some countries – even surpassing pre-pandemic levels. In the first quarter of 2024, there were 452.6 million overnight stays in tourist accommodations across the EU, marking a seven percent increase compared with the same quarter of 2023, according to Eurostat data released last week.Foreign visitors accounted for approximately 45 percent of all overnight stays in the first three months of 2024, with large differences among EU countries. The biggest share of foreign visitors staying overnight at the beginning of the year was recorded in Malta (91 percent), Cyprus (87 percent), Luxembourg (82 percent) and Austria (78 percent). They are followed by Portugal, Croatia, Spain, Slovenia, Latvia, and Belgium. At the bottom of the ranking are Germany, Romania and Poland, with a share of foreign overnight stays of around 20 percent.Derided as â€œClub Medâ€ nations during the European debt crisis 15 years ago, the economies of Spain, Greece and Portugal are now outperforming their northern peers – thanks to a rebound in tourism. The three nations had to endure harsh austerity measures in the early 2010s imposed by their European Union partners, who were quick to blame their fiscal laxity and lack of competitiveness for their economic woes.But â€œthe situation has changedâ€ since the Covid-19 pandemic ended, said Zsolt Darvas, an economist at Bruegel, a Brussels-based think tank. â€œToday, those countries are growing faster than the European Union average, they are no longer seen as black sheep.â€Sunny side up: post-pandemic tourism reboundsTourism in the three countries reached record levels last year following the lifting of pandemic travel restrictions. They are also benefiting from the EUâ€™s massive pandemic recovery fund, whose mix of grants and loans in exchange for structural reforms largely goes to southern countries.Spainâ€™s gross domestic product expanded by 2.5 percent last year, while Portugalâ€™s economy grew by 2.3 percent and Greece by two percent. That compares to growth of 0.4 percent for the entire 27-member EU, which was weighed down by Germanyâ€™s 0.3-percent-contraction, making it the worldâ€™s worst-performing major economy in 2023.Italyâ€™s tourism sector saw its highest ever number of tourists in 2023, registering a 13.4-percent increase in arrivals and a 9.5-percent increase in overnight stays compared to 2022, according to the latest figures from the Italian statistics authority Istat and the Ministry of Tourism. The report said these levels were comfortably above the pre-pandemic ones of 2019, the year before the pandemic began.Slovenian tourism posted record results last year despite the devastating floods that hit the country in early August. The country, which has about 2.1 million inhabitants, welcomed 6.2 million tourists, up 5.5 percent compared to 2022 and only 0.6 percent less than in 2019. Overnight stays grew by 3.5 percent year-on-year to a record 16.1 million, surpassing 2019 figures by two percent.However, the industry has faced a number of challenges in recent years, one of which is a chronic shortage of staff. In Austria for example, the management consulting company Deloitte has examined the status quo in tourism with the Austrian Hoteliers Association (Ã–HV). According to the report, high costs, staff shortages and the weak economy are a burden.Â The tourist zone at Ksamil Beach, 275 kilometers southwest of Tirana, Albania. Photo: Albanian Telegraphic AgencyEU supports tourism in the blocâ€™s neighbourhoodIn North Macedonia, the number of tourists in the period from January until April 2024, compared to the same period last year, rose by 15.3 percent, and the number of overnight stays increased by 15.2 percent. A majority of those came from Turkey, Germany, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria, Croatia and Slovenia.The countryâ€™s Agency for Promotion and Support of Tourism (APPT) is currently working on implementing the Interreg IPA-CBC â€œÐboveâ€ project for cross border cooperation with Greece, funded through EUâ€™s Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA). These funds support countries in the EUâ€™s enlargement region.Neighbouring Albania was visited by 10.1 million tourists last year, an increase of 35 percent compared to 2022, during which the country was visited by 7.5 million tourists. The upward trend continued in the first months of 2024, when about 974,000 foreign tourists visited Albania during May alone, bringing the total number of incoming tourist flows to more than 3.3 million in the first five months of the year.Bulgaria and Croatia: adopting the Euro is key for tourismDr. Polina Karastoyanova, Executive Director of the National Tourism Board of Bulgaria, said during an economic forum in Sofia that it is important for Bulgaria as a tourist destination to become part of the Eurozone. She added that the tourism industry is one of the few sectors in the country that has the potential to double its size.Speaking at a conference on the risks and challenges of the Euro changeover in Croatia, held at the end of May, Mislav BrkiÄ‡ of the Croatian National Bank argued that countries like Croatia – which already joined the Eurozone on January 1, 2023 – and Bulgaria have the most to gain from being a part of this currency union. He said that by adopting the Euro, his country became safer for the markets, and there would be a positive impact on tourism as well.Tourism in Croatia is a major industry of the country's economy, accounting for almost 20 percent of the gross domestic product. According to Eurostat data, Croatia ranked second in terms of the increase in foreign overnight stays in the first quarter of 2024: a 22 percent increase compared to the same period last year.People stroll past the Ballermann 6 beach club on a sunny day in Mallorca. Foto: Clara Margais/dpaCracking down on overcrowdingWhile the increasing levels of tourism in Europe offer an optimistic outlook for local and national economies, overcrowding during busy holiday seasons like the summer is causing growing resentment among the residents of popular hotspots across the continent.The rise of websites such as Airbnb has created excesses such as mass tourism, illegal rentals and pressure on the housing market, according to Members of the European Parliament (MEPs). In Italian cities like Venice, Rome and some cities in the Tuscany region, residents are calling for the flow of visitors to be better controlled and restricted. In an attempt to reduce the crowds, Venice has recently introduced an entrance fee for day trips.In Spain, the mayor of Palma de Mallorca, Jaime MartÃ­nez, has presented a series of plans aimed at countering mass tourism in the city centre. The most sweeping proposal is a ban on more rental space for tourists in any form, local media reported. He also suggests introducing regulations to curb the rental of properties to foreigners.In the Netherlands, Amsterdam also saw a rise of visitors in 2023 compared to the previous year. Last year, 15.1 million day visitors visited the capital, up from 13.4 million a year earlier. Some 60 percent of visitors came from the Netherlands, the rest from abroad.The city expects the number of tourists to continue to rise. â€œThe flow of visitors puts pressure on facilities and, in particular, the city centre is often too crowded,â€ according to a statement issued by the municipality.In March 2024, the Council of the EU gave its final approval on a regulation requiring platforms to share data on landlords with municipalities, among others. This will allow local administrators to take stricter action if landlords do not comply with the rules. The European Parliament already approved the regulation in February this year.Fact check: Rainbow flags on Greek hotels ahead of EuroPride 2024From June 21-29, 2024, the Greek city of Thessaloniki will host the EuroPride, a pan-European international event for the LGBTQ+ community hosted by a different European city every year. The event draws lots of tourists to the host city during the celebrations. False claims circulating on social media in April said that the Greek government had issued a binding order for hotels in Thessaloniki to fly the rainbow flag ahead of the event.The fact-checking team of Agence France-Presse (AFP) debunked these claims, explaining that the countryâ€™s tourism ministry provided hotels with guidelines to make their establishments more LGBTQ+-friendly – but these were only voluntary recommendations.Read AFPâ€™s full fact check here: https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.34P46UZThis article is published weekly.

EU ministers extend protection rules for Ukrainian war refugees,"Following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU set up a temporary protection regime for Ukrainian war refugees. On Thursday, EU justice and home affairs ministers extended the rules for another year until March 2026.Luxembourg (dpa) – War refugees from Ukraine will be able to remain in the European Union until at least March 2026, as per emergency rules extended by EU justice and home affairs ministers on Thursday.Ukrainians who fled to the European Union after the full-scale invasion of their country by Russia in February 2022 were granted immediate protection after EU member states set up a temporary regime designed for cases of mass influxes of people.The proposal is designed to avoid the lengthy national asylum-seeking procedures required to process large numbers of displaced people. In addition, people under temporary protection are entitled to social benefits, housing, access to education and work permits, among other things. Extensions of the temporary rules are possible for up to one year.The existing regime was set to end in March 2025. The European Commission proposed to extend the emergency rules on Tuesday, arguing that ""safe and durable conditions for the return of people to Ukraine are not currently in place"" due to continued Russian attacks on both civil and critical infrastructure.The Commission reported that almost 4.2 million Ukrainians are currently residing in the EU under these rules, with Germany hosting the most people at 1.2 million. However, the number of Ukrainian refugees in relation to the population is significantly higher in countries such as the Czech Republic, Lithuania and Poland. (14 June)",1
EU leaders to haggle over bloc's top jobs at Brussels summit,"At an informal summit in Brussels on Monday, EU leaders are expected to negotiate the distribution of the EU's top jobs after the elections â€“ notably the posts of European Commission President, European Council President and foreign affairs chief.Brussels (dpa) – European Union leaders are due to meet on Monday for a special summit to discuss who will fill the 27-nation bloc's top posts in Brussels.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, a German centre-right Christian Democrat, is seeking support for a second term in office.Her group in the European Parliament, the European People's Party (EPP), scored a clear victory in this month's elections for the legislature, strengthening her chances for another five-year term. But she will still need the backing of a few other political groups in parliament, plus the support of a majority of the EU's national leaders.""It is clear that after the results of the elections everything speaks in favour of Ursula von der Leyen having a second term in office,"" German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in an interview on Saturday.Leaders meet over a working dinner in Brussels on Monday. The future post of president of the European Council – currently held by Charles Michel – and the post of high representative for foreign affairs and security policy – currently held by Josep Borrell – are also likely to be negotiated.Former Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa is currently seen as a likely candidate for the post of European Council president. Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas is tipped as the bloc's next foreign affairs chief.The leaders of the EU member states will also meet again the following week, on 27 and 28 June, for a regular summit. By this time, the personnel planning is hoped to have been finalised and will only need to be formalised. If not, the national leaders will continue discussions about filling the top posts in Brussels. (17 June)",1
EU ministers approve contested Nature Restoration Law,"EU member states adopted a long-debated Nature Restoration Law. Luxembourg/Vienna (dpa) - The purpose of the Nature Restoration Law is to regrow forests, re-wet moors and return rivers to their natural, free-flowing states. The law has proven controversial, particularly because of fears of heavy restrictions on farmers.Ministers for 20 of the EU's 27 member states voted in favour, representing 66 percent of the population. A decision by EUÂ member states was held up until now because not enough national ministers were prepared to back it, despite a preliminary agreement among senior diplomats last year.The conservation law sets a target for the EU to restore at least 20 percent of the bloc's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050. Funding for the improvements is expected to come from both the private sector and member states' budgets, though some EU programmes - such as regional development funding - could help cover some of the costs. According to EU figures, around 80 percent of habitats are in poor condition. In addition, 10 percent of bee and butterfly species are threatened with extinction and 70 percent of soils are in an unhealthy state.Austrian Environment Minister Leonor Gewessler's decision to back the law - against the wishes of Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer - provided the necessary majority. Her decision sparked uproar in Vienna, with Nehammer saying he will seek to overturn the decision in the EU's top court.Gewessler may face criminal charges in Austria for abuse of office, a senior political official in Vienna said.Italy, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Finland and Sweden voted against the legislation. Belgium, which is currently responsible for chairing talks among member states, abstained.Welcoming the ministers' decision, EU Environment Commissioner Virginijus SinkeviÄius said on X, ""We are still on track to reverse the biodiversity loss, letâ€™s now start work together and show that EU is still leading the way.""Confirming the adoption of the bill, the Belgian government said on X that it is ""the final step before this law can enter into force.""After ministers approved the law on Monday, a coalition of environmental campaigners, including the World Wildlife Fund, said in a statement that the vote is ""a massive victory for Europeâ€™s nature and citizens who have been long calling for immediate action to tackle natureâ€™s alarming decline.""German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke has praised Monday's approval of the much-debated Nature Restoration Law by EU member states, describing it as a crucial step for a healthy environment in Europe. ""I very much welcome that EU member states have today adopted the regulation on nature restoration,"" the Green politician said. (17 June)",1
No deal on EU top jobs after informal Brussels summit,"Despite expectations for Mondayâ€™s informal summit, EU leaders did not seal the deal on who will take over the blocâ€™s top jobs after the European elections. Three names are on the table: Ursula von der Leyen, AntÃ³nio Costa and Kaja Kallas. Will they cross the finish line when leaders meet again next week?European Union leaders did not reach a final decision on the blocâ€™s top jobs at an informal summit in Brussels on Monday, aimed at agreeing on suitable candidates for the EUâ€™s senior positions after the European elections.Although the meeting was planned as a first exchange of points of view on the negotiations, several names came to the table with the support of a majority of leaders: German conservative Ursula von der Leyen as European Commission chief, socialist former Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa as head of the European Council and liberal current Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas as High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.â€œWe will not have a rerun of 2019, when it was a big tombola, and everything was up for grabs for three days,â€ said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. â€œThatâ€™s not the case here. It seems to be much more clear.â€Following the start of the negotiations, the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP) also proposed a change to the tradition of two consecutive two-and-a-half-year terms for the European Council President role. The idea was to open up the possibility to share the position between the EPP and another political group, each serving for one term.EU leaders will meet again next week to continue the discussions on the three senior positions. European Council President Charles Michel emphasised that it is â€œa collective duty to make a decisionâ€ when leaders return to Brussels.Gathering support left and rightThe largest pan-EU political bloc – the EPP– was the biggest winner in the June 6-9 European Parliament elections, cementing the German conservative von der Leyenâ€™s bid for five more years leading the Commission. To secure the nod from EU leaders, von der Leyen needs support from a â€œqualified majorityâ€ of 15 out of 27 countries, covering at least 65 percent of the blocâ€™s population.A dozen leaders come from her political grouping, but she also needed to win over French President Emmanuel Macron from the centrist Renew Europe group and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz of the Socialists and Democrats (S&D).Scholz laid the ground early for von der Leyenâ€™s nomination in an interview on Saturday. â€œIt is clear that after the results of the elections everything speaks in favour of Ursula von der Leyen having a second term in office,â€ Scholz said.Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob openly expressed support for von der Leyen. â€œOur experience with the president of the European Commission has been very positive,â€ he said, speaking of the instrumental role she played in helping Slovenia get â€œabundant financial support from Brusselsâ€ after the devastating floods in August 2023.The second-biggest group in parliament, the Socialists and Democrats (S&D), had their sights set on the Council position, with Costa seen as the frontrunner. Despite the cloud hanging over him since he became embroiled in a corruption probe, forcing his resignation in November 2023, he continues to be tipped to succeed the Belgian Charles Michel.Naming the 47-year-old Kallas – an outspoken Kremlin critic – as the blocâ€™s foreign affairs chief would send a strong signal to the EUâ€™s east. Ahead of the talks, the blocâ€™s biggest eastern power, Poland, announced that it was backing Kallas for the role. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n hit out at the outcome of Mondayâ€™s talks as a done deal. â€œThey don't care about reality, they donâ€™t care about the results of the European elections,â€ OrbÃ¡n wrote in a post on social media, â€œand they donâ€™t care about the will of the European people.â€What happens next?The 27 EU leaders will meet again to forge an agreement at a formal summit on June 27 and 28 in Brussels. If, as expected, von der Leyen ultimately pockets enough leadersâ€™ votes, she can set about choosing her commissioners – drawn from each of the EU member countries, with consideration for gender balance and political affiliation.  But she will have one more hurdle to pass: the new European Parliament has to approve leadersâ€™ picks and proposed commissioners.Negotiations for the other two posts – with Costa and Kallas in the spotlight – are also expected to continue at the summit.A fourth job in play is that of European Parliament president, which is decided by the legislature, not the leaders. At the moment, it is likely to return to the incumbent, the EPPâ€™s Roberta Metsola, for another two-and-a-half-year term.Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡, Prime Minister of Croatia, recalled that in the next few years there is more at stake than these top jobs in Brussels. â€œThere are also the Secretary General of NATO, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, the recently elected head of the European Investment Bank – and in this whole context it is necessary to see how the will of the voters is reflected in the European elections and how the current state of governments in certain countries is reflected,â€ he said.This article is published weekly.

European Commission takes action against seven EU countries for excessive debt,"Belgium, France, Hungary, Italy, Malta, Poland and Slovakia have been warned about their excessive budget deficits and instructed by the European Commission to reduce their public spending in line with EU rules.Brussels (dpa) – On Wednesday, the European Commission started disciplinary proceedings against France, Italy and five other European Union member states for taking up excessive new debt, in breach of EU rules.Belgium, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia have also been taken to task by the European Union's executive arm for the budget deficits they have been running.Wednesday's Commission decision is the first step in a process called an excessive deficit procedure (EDP), instructing the seven EU countries to reduce their public spending in line with EU standards. The EU decided to suspend the debt and deficit regulations in the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic and the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine. With the rules now back in place, after some reforms were negotiated, any EU country that breaches the debt and deficit limits risks legal punishment.Under recently reintroduced EU budget rules, member states must keep their debt within 60 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) and limit their deficit to 3 percent of GDP.Â  According to the Commission's economic forecast, France (5.5 percent deficit), Italy (-4.4 percent deficit) and the five other EU member states will breach this budget deficit limit in 2024.In May, the Commission had already forecast that multiple EU countries were going to breach regulations on budget deficits and national debt levels in 2024.Austria, Finland, Spain and Estonia were also flagged in the May forecast but received a reprieve on Wednesday after their comparative debt levels were deemed favourable and their deficit judged to be temporary. Romania was also highlighted but is already subject to disciplinary proceedings over high debt and deficit levels.EU finance ministers will be asked to approve the Commission's assessment in July. Then, under the supervision of the Commission, countries subject to an EDP must submit measures to reduce their debt and deficit for four years. (19 June)",1
Top European rights court rules Russia guilty of abuses in Crimea,"The European Court of Human Rights said Russia violated the right to life, the freedom of expression and assembly, among other abuses. Ukraine had filed a complaint with the court. The impact of the ruling is likely limited as Russia refuses to recognize the court judgements. The EU's foreign ministers on Monday adopted new Russia santions. Brussels - The European Court of Human Rights ruled on Tuesday that Russia committed rights violations in Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow occupied and annexed in violation of international law in 2014.Russia violated the right to life, the prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment, and freedom of expression and assembly, the court said, among other abuses.Judges sided with Ukraine, Russia guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" The ruling means the judges in Strasbourg have sided with Ukraine, which had filed a complaint with the court alleging a ""pattern of persecution"" of non-Russians in Crimea.Ukraine's allegations included unlawful detentions, ill-treatment of civilians, and the suppression of the Ukrainian media and the Ukrainian language in schools.The court's unanimous judgement said there was sufficient evidence - corroborated by a range of witness testimony and reports from non-governmental organizations - to find Russia guilty ""beyond a reasonable doubt.""It said the ""incidents had been sufficiently numerous and interconnected"" and amounted to a ""system of violations.""Impact of court ruling possibly limited The impact of the decision is likely to be limited as Russia refuses to recognize the judgements of the court.The country was expelled from the Council of Europe in the wake of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. As a result, it is no longer a member of the European Convention on Human Rights, which the court in Strasbourg enforces.However, the court can still rule on incidents that occurred before Russia's expulsion. The case in question on Tuesday dates back to March 2014.The Council of Europe is an institution independent of the European Union. EU foreign ministers adopted new Russia sanctions, targeting LNG for the first timeEU foreign ministers on Monday adopted new punitive measures to crack down on sanctions evasion and stop Russia from obtaining Western technology for making weapons with the EU's 14th sanctions package.A further 69 individuals and 47 entities linked to the Russian invasion of Ukraine have also been sanctioned with an asset freeze and in the case of persons, a travel ban to the European Union. The new salvo of sanctions target Russia's multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector for the first time.On Tuesday, Russia said it is blocking access to 81 EU media outlets as a ""retaliatory measure"" after Brussels last month imposed broadcasting bans on several Russian state media.""Counter-restrictions are being introduced on the access from Russian territory of broadcast resources of media outlets from EU member states,"" Moscow's foreign ministry said in a statement, publishing a list of media outlets and blaming Brussels for the restrictions.(June 24/25)",1
"Hungary’s EU presidency: How could Orbán influence the direction of the EU?
","On Monday, Hungary takes over the rotating EU Council presidency from Belgium. Watched closely by many, the country aims to â€œMake Europe Great Againâ€ and plans to focus on EU enlargement, defence and competitiveness. Ukraine might face six tougher months in the EU realm.Taking over from the Belgians, Hungary will hold the presidency of the Council of the European Union until the end of 2024. The country, led by ultranationalist Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n has a reputation of repeatedly blocking EU decisions and will hence be closely watched throughout the presidency.While each EU country fights tooth and nail for its own interests, when they take over the presidency of the EU Council they are meant to put their politics aside to take on a more neutral role.During a press conference on June 18 in Budapest, the Hungarian Minister for European Affairs, JÃ¡nos BÃ³ka, stressed that Hungary will be â€œan honest intermediaryâ€.Looking back: what has the Belgian presidency achieved in the last six months?When a country takes over the presidency with European elections on the horizon – like it was the case for Belgium, there is a clear overriding objective – to wrap up as many legislative files as possible. By the time the European Parliament was dissolved at the end of April, more than 60 files were given the green light. These included the new asylum and migration pact and the package on budgetary surveillance. It is worth noting that some files were already negotiated successfully by the preceding Spanish presidency.After the June 6–9 elections – and with some unexpected help from Austriaâ€™s Environment Minister Leonore Gewessler – the Belgian presidency managed to find the necessary majority to approve the Nature Restoration Law. The law had been at the centre of long and heated debates on European and national levels.The forthcoming Hungarian presidency also added to the legislative push, given the known stances of Hungary within the EU. Throughout the Belgian reign, Belgium managed to find consensus on new financial support, including via profits from frozen assets of the Russian central bank. EU membership negotiations with Ukraine started this week, too. In addition, the 13th and 14th sanctions packages against Russia have been adopted. The latter on Monday, which targets Russiaâ€™s multi-billion dollar liquefied natural gas (LNG) sector for the first time.  Hungary wants to â€œMake Europe Great Againâ€ The government of Hungary, headed by Viktor OrbÃ¡n, assumes the rotating and semi-annual EU presidency under the controversial motto â€œMake Europe Great Againâ€, almost the same slogan with which former US president Donald Trump triumphed in the 2016 elections.â€œEurope is experiencing an exceptional situation, with problems such as a war in the neighbourhood or immigration,â€ Hungarian Minister for European Affairs JÃ¡nos BÃ³ka said while promising that the presidency of his country will be â€œan honest intermediaryâ€.The same was stressed by the Permanent Representative of Hungary to the EU, BÃ¡lint Ã“dor, while presenting the priorities of the presidency to the European press. â€œIt will be a presidency like any other. We will be honest mediators, we will try to cooperate sincerely with EU countries and institutions.â€ EU politicians – long used to blockades from Budapest – remain sanguine about the threat of Hungary gumming up the EU system and say theyâ€™ve been war-gaming ways around an obstinate Budapest if needed. The country takes the reins just after EU elections, meaning that much of the next six months will be taken up with installing a new European Parliament and executive arm.  Diplomats say the presidency only affords limited power, and if other countries want an issue discussed they can override the presidency and vote it onto the table. â€œEven if the presidency doesnâ€™t like it, you can put an item on the agenda,â€ one of the senior diplomats said. â€œSo Iâ€™m not afraid of Hungary.â€Seven priorities for the next six monthsHungary established seven priorities for its presidency: improving competitiveness, common defence and the defence of external borders, as well as advancing enlargement and promoting cohesion policies, agriculture and addressing demographic problems.Furthermore, Hungary expects progress in lifting Schengen land border controls for Bulgaria and Romania and the fight against anti-Semitism. The country also wants to promote discussions on topics linked to higher education and the protection of cultural heritage. Among the key themes of the presidency will be EU Enlargement, with a view to the Western Balkans, rather than Ukraine. â€œWhen it comes to the Western Balkans, we would like as much progress as possible. We aim to open and close as many negotiation clusters as possible. We need to speed this process up,â€ said Ã“dor, in conversation with Brussels correspondents.The Hungarian Presidency wants to hold a summit in the region between the EU and the Western Balkans nations – Serbia, Kosovo, Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro. All countries have candidate country status, apart from Kosovo despite having requested it. Currently, the EU has opened accession negotiations with Serbia, Albania, North Macedonia and Montenegro. In March 2024, the bloc conditionally agreed to open formal talks with Bosnia and Herzegovina on joining the European Union. According to Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, Hungaryâ€™s goal during the first half of its presidency is to initiate negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina and hold the first intergovernmental talks. Szijjarto also said that there are member states in the European Parliament that publicly support enlargement but speak differently behind closed doors. He also asked all Hungarian diplomats to actively lobby for the opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina.Ukraineâ€™s EU accession path is expected to get rockierEuropean officials and diplomats fret that EU support for Ukraine, which is at war with Russia after being invaded by Vladimir Putinâ€™s army, could suffer from Hungaryâ€™s six-month presidency.According to the Permanent Representative of Hungary to the EU BÃ¡lint Ã“dor, Hungary will not promote Ukraineâ€™s and Moldovaâ€™s accession negotiations. Budapest – Russiaâ€™s closest ally in the bloc – has repeatedly held up sanctions on Moscow over the war. For the past years it has blocked the disbursement of EU funds to help arm Ukraine.This article is published weekly. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
EU leaders to seal final deal on package of top jobs at summit,"Following last weekâ€™s informal summit, EU leaders are back at the negotiating table to decide who will take over three key EU positions after the European elections.Brussels (dpa) – EU leaders are set to agree on a package deal to divide up the European Union's top jobs at a two-day summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, June 27 and 28.The pre-packaged pact, informally agreed among EU leaders would see the German conservative and current European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen nominated for a second term.Former socialist Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa should be the next European Council president and the liberal Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas is to be the EU's new foreign policy chief.The agreement on the top jobs was negotiated among the centre-right European People's Party (EPP), the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) group and the liberal Renew Europe group.The three names were the front runners for the roles over a week ago in Brussels – the last time EU leaders tried to reach a deal amongst themselves – but they did not reach the finish line.The EU's top jobs are shared out after European Parliament elections in an intricate process that is meant to account for the results of the vote, according to the EU treaties. In practice, the path to power is more complicated, and national and European politics take over, with EU leaders haggling over their preferences to fill the bloc's most important policy positions.Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has pushed hard for the results of her far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI) party in the European elections to be recognised and has harshly criticised the process to divide up the jobs.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n also hit out at the deal. In a post on X, the conservative populist prime minister said ""EU top officials should represent every member state, not just leftists and liberals.""After her nomination by EU leaders, von der Leyen needs to be elected as head of the Commission by a majority in the European Parliament in the coming weeks.The EU legislature must also approve Kallas for the role of EU foreign policy chief. Costa does not require parliamentary approval to assume his role as European Council president. (27 June)",1
"Germany, Poland, Czech Republic seek EU money for Ukraine refugees","Following Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, large numbers of Ukrainian refugees have been residing in Germany, Poland and the Czech republic. The three EU member states have asked the European Commission for financial support.Brussels (dpa) – The leaders of Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic have signed a joint letter calling for the European Union to provide more funding for Ukrainian refugees on their respective territories.The letter calls on the EU to help the three countries share the burden of supporting large numbers of displaced people who were forced to flee Ukraine after Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022.""The refugees actually reside predominantly and in large numbers in just a few [EU] member states,"" the letter says. ""Our countries' capacities are strained: more than 50% of Ukrainian refugees who have entered the European Union live in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic,"" it adds.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk and Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala write that they need more money from the EU budget. Under EU rules, any proposal for new funding would have to come from the European Commission.""We would be grateful if the European Commission could take appropriate steps to this end, thus making a further contribution towards our joint endeavour to tackle these challenges, as well as towards European solidarity,"" the leaders write.""We kindly ask you to put forward a proposal on this in the near future which can be implemented in a timely manner.""At the same time, Scholz, Tusk and Fiala also use their letter ""to expressly thank the European Commission for its efforts so far,"" such as extending measures to ease residency rules for Ukrainians in the EU.

"EU opens membership talks with Ukraine, Moldova, progress for Montenegro","War-torn Ukraine and neighbouring Moldova are now officially in accession talks with the European Union. Both countries were granted EU candidate status in 2022. The landmark move has been hailed as historic and is the start of a complex process that could take years.Â On June 25, the European Union officially started accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova – a move lauded by many officials as a marker in the history of EU accessions. Both countries have made rapid progress on structural reforms mandatory to join the bloc over the last two years. In December, EU government leaders had already stated the talks could start if the two former Soviet republics did some additional homework.The landmark move signals a vote of confidence in Kyivâ€™s future at a time when Moscow has momentum on the battlefield almost two and a half years into Russiaâ€™s invasion.Â â€œThis is a truly historical moment for my country,â€ said the Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine, Olga Stefanishyna, who noted that the start of talks gives Ukrainians â€œthe moral power to continue withstanding"" Russia.Moldova, a former Soviet republic, is holding presidential elections in October. The countryâ€™s pro-Western authorities frequently accuse the Kremlin of interfering in its internal affairs. Russia also has troops stationed in the breakaway region of Transnistria.While acknowledging and praising the progress made by both countries, some pointed out that the opening of talks is the symbolic start of the membership process. This process is likely to take years – and may never lead to membership.Â â€œThe path ahead will be challenging,â€ said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. European Council President Charles Michel pointed out that Ukraine and Moldova will have to continue carrying out â€œsubstantial reformsâ€ to comply with the 33 chapters that make up the accession process.â€œIt is the official start of a very complex and long process,â€ according to Czech minister for European Affairs, Martin DvoÅ™Ã¡k, recalling the 15-year-long accession talks of his country.Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine has reinvigorated a push in the EU to take on new members, after years in which countriesâ€™ progress to join has seemingly slowed down, particularly in the Western Balkans.The EU in December 2023 also granted candidate status to former Soviet republic Georgia. In March, the bloc also approved the conditional opening of accession negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina and has talks ongoing with Serbia, Montenegro, Albania and North Macedonia.What happens after negotiations are opened?Â The opening of the talks marks just the beginning: The accession process now starts with an inventory of how far Ukraine and Moldova have already come in regards to their legislation and an assessment of which reforms of their democratic, economic-financial, judicial and social systems are still needed to align with EU requirements. This stocktaking will take months. Then, step by step, different â€˜chaptersâ€™ will be opened to gradually align fully with the EUâ€™s requirements.For Ukraine this process is strewn with political obstacles. Standing in the way along that journey will be not just Russia's efforts at destabilisation but reticence from doubters inside the EU, most notably Hungary who will assume the six-month rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union on July 1. Budapest has been opposed to pressing ahead with Kyivâ€™s membership bid, arguing that Ukraine was unfairly moving ahead for political reasons. â€œFrom what I see here as we speak, they are very far from meeting the accession criteria,â€ Hungaryâ€™s Europe minister JÃ¡nos BÃ³ka said on Tuesday.Â Accession negotiations can begin because Budapest lifted its veto on the process which can only advance with the unanimity of all member states. Hungary demanded that Ukraine respects the rights of the Hungarian minority in the country and after intense discussions this is now noted in the EUâ€™s negotiation framework document. Accepting Ukraine, a country of some 40 million people, would be a major step for the EU, and there are calls for the bloc to carry out reforms to streamline how it works before accepting new members.It is currently considered impossible for Ukraine to become a member state prior to the end of the Russian war of aggression. If Ukraine was a member, Kyiv could then call for military assistance in accordance with Article 42, paragraph 7 of the EU Treaty – and the EU would be a war party.The negotiations also come at a tense time in Moldova after the United States, Britain and Canada warned of a Russian â€œplotâ€ to influence the countryâ€™s presidential elections in October.President Maia Sandu has accused Moscow, which has troops stationed in the breakaway Transnistria region of the country, of aiming to destabilise Moldova ahead of the vote. Belgian Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib stated that the relationship between the EU and Moldova was already bearing fruit. The European Union is Moldovaâ€™s largest trading partner, which in turn offers important opportunities for business and foreign investment.Montenegro moving forward after seven years of virtual standstillÂ Besides talks with Ukraine and Moldova, this week officials have held their 16th meeting of the Accession Conference with Montenegro to take stock of Podgoricaâ€™s progress. This included advances in reaching interim benchmarks regarding the rule of law chapters.Â EU Commissioner for Enlargement OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi said that Montenegro has ""met the interim benchmarks in the rule of law areaâ€ and can now move on to â€œstart closing chaptersâ€.Â The Balkan country obtained candidate status in 2010 and accession negotiations began in 2012. Montenegroâ€™s Prime Minister Milojko SpajiÄ‡ spoke of a â€œhistoric momentâ€ but also acknowledged that his country â€œhad a long period of droughtâ€. He further stated his country had achieved results in the past seven months that were comparable to those achieved over the last seven years and hopes for his country to become a member state by 2028.Hristijan Mickoski (in front) was elected Prime Minister of North Macedonia on June 23. He is also the leader of the nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party. Photo: MIANorth Macedonia: New government angers its Greek and Bulgarian EU neighboursÂ The newly elected North Macedonian government is fuelling the fire thought previously extinguished by referring to the country by its old name â€œMacedoniaâ€ which doesnâ€™t only anger Athens but is a source of concern for Brussels, too. The country changed its name to North Macedonia after a UN-brokered deal with Greece in 2018. Athens had not accepted the old name as its northern province is called Macedonia. While the name change has paved North Macedoniaâ€™s way to NATO membership, the countryâ€™s EU bid is still pending nearly twenty years after receiving candidate status in 2005. North Macedoniaâ€™s Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski recently said: â€œI will call myself whatever I want.â€ During her auguration, the countryâ€™s new president, Gordana Siljanovska-Davkova, had also demonstratively used the old country name – causing a diplomatic stir.Greeceâ€™s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a speech in parliament on June 26, that the new government in Skopje had â€œnot made a good startâ€ and had violated obligations under international agreements with regard to North Macedoniaâ€™s aspiration to join the EU. All EU member states must agree to the enlargement. In his first week as prime minister, Mickoski also caused tensions to rise again with North Macedoniaâ€™s eastern neighbour Bulgaria by saying that the negotiating framework for the countryâ€™s accession to the European Union can be changed.â€žYou want changes in the Constitution? Why? Who is violating the rights of the Bulgarian community in [North] Macedonia?â€ Mickoski said on June 25 regarding the stipulation to recognise Bulgarians as one of the constituent peoples in the basic law of the country.Bulgarian President Rumen Radev responded, stating that Mickoskiâ€™s rhetoric is aimed directly against European principles and decisions taken by consensus by all member states, against international commitments, â€œbut most of all against its own citizens who have clearly stated their ambitions for the European development of the countryâ€.The nationalist VMRO-DPMNE party won the parliamentary elections in North Macedonia in May and formed a new government together with smaller parties at the end of June.Â This article is published twice a week.

EU: Meta 'pay or consent' advertising may break online gatekeeper law,"Following preliminary findings, the European Commission has informed tech giant Meta that its â€˜pay or consentâ€™ model may breach rules under the European Unionâ€™s Digital Markets Act.Brussels (dpa) – On Monday, The European Commission informed Meta – owner of the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – that its policy of asking users to either accept personalised advertising across its services or pay may violate the European Union's digital ""gatekeeper"" rules.In the Commission's ""preliminary view,"" the big tech company's policy breaches the Digital Markets Act (DMA). The DMA regulates the behaviour of digital ""gatekeepers,"" meaning companies that hold powerful, entrenched positions in the EU's digital economy, acting as intermediaries between many users and businesses.Meta could face fines as high as 10 percent of its global revenue if the Commission's final decision upholds this assessment, which at this time is not final and is part of an ongoing investigation into the company.The Commission said in a statement on Monday that to comply with the DMA, users who refuse consent ""should still get access to an equivalent service which uses less of their personal data.""Though the investigation is under the DMA – which is essentially a digital competition law – consent for the processing of personal data is normally regulated under the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).However, the DMA has specific rules where a gatekeeper wants to combine personal data from its different services. It requires gatekeepers to ask for consent, and to provide an equivalent alternative service if users refuse.The Commission said Meta's model ""does not allow users to exercise their right to freely consent to the combination of their personal data.""The Commission has until March 25 next year to reach a final decision.

Von der Leyen to face tight vote for second term after EU leaders seal top jobs deal,"The European Parliament is currently scheduled to vote on the appointment of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a second term on July 18. At a summit in Brussels last week, EU leaders reached a final agreement on the three top EU posts â€“ but negotiations ran into opposition from Italy and Hungary.Ursula von der Leyen has navigated back-to-back crises from the Covid-19 pandemic to Russiaâ€™s war against Ukraine as head of the European Commission, and stands on the verge of a no-less tumultuous second term – provided she can lock in support from EU lawmakers.At a summit last week, EU leaders gave their green light to nominate the German conservative and former defence minister for a second term as president of the Commission. But their endorsement does not mean that von der Leyenâ€™s second term is confirmed just yet.At the summit, the liberal Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas was nominated for EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Both von der Leyen and Kallas will need to lock in majority support in the European Parliament.Â The socialist former Portuguese Prime Minister AntÃ³nio Costa was elected as President of the European Council for a two-and-a-half year term, taking office on December 1, 2024. His appointment does not require the approval of the European Parliament. He was directly elected by the members of the institution, the heads of state or government of the 27 EU member states, for which a qualified majority was needed.â€œThey are good people who guarantee good work and who will also ensure that Europe, in the coming years, in such difficult times, is well positioned,â€ said German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, negotiator for the social democratic party family.â€œI believe these experienced politicians will lead the European Union in these turbulent times with much sound judgement, wisdom and optimism,â€ Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob said after the European Council meeting. Golob is affiliated with the liberal Renew Europe group.However, the final deal was passed without consensus. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni abstained in the vote on the nomination of von der Leyen, while voting against the election of Costa and the nomination of Kallas. As Meloniâ€™s ally, nationalist Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n also voted against von der Leyen, but in favour of Costa, while abstaining on Kallas.The European Parliament will be von der Leyenâ€™s next stop, since she will have to find a majority of 361 MEPs in the 720-seat hemicycle. The vote is currently scheduled to take place on July 18. In 2019, she secured the European Parliamentâ€™s backing by just nine votes.Von der Leyenâ€™s troubled path to a second termEU leaders are hoping a coalition of three political groups will secure her confirmation, reflecting mainly the group affiliations of the prime ministers and presidents who backed her in the European Council.The three groups are von der Leyenâ€™s own centre-right European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP), the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and the liberal Renew Europe group. The informal alliance theoretically has a comfortable majority of around 400 of the 720 votes. Scholz expressed optimism that the European Parliament will back von der Leyenâ€™s nomination for a second term at the helm of the EUâ€™s executive. â€œThe president has a very good reputation in parliament after all,â€ he said.However, it is considered possible that some MEPs will deviate from the party line in the secret ballot and not vote for the German. From now until mid-July von der Leyen will have to negotiate and gather support from the groups as well as individual parliamentary delegations. She has already met with the Greens. â€œWe had a very constructive meeting with Ursula von der Leyen in which we talked about the goal of a stable, reliable majority,â€ said the groupâ€™s co-chair, Terry Reintke. â€œWe made it clear that we will not be part of a majority that negotiates with or relies on the extreme right, including the ECR.â€Â Von der Leyen and her EPP party family had not ruled out working with the right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group during the election campaign.Meloni has pushed hard, but unsuccessfully, for one of the top jobs to be given to a member of the soft-eurosceptic ECR group, which includes her far-right Brothers of Italy (FdI) party and came third in the European Parliament elections.Giorgia Meloni, Prime Minister of Italy (2nd from the right), is greeted by Alexander De Croo, Prime Minister of Belgium (l), Peter Pellegrini, President of Slovakia (2nd from the left) and Petr Fiala, Prime Minister of the Czech Republic (r), during a round table meeting at an EU summit. Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP/dpaMeloni and OrbÃ¡n put up a fightMeloni said the exclusion of the ECR from the top jobsâ€™ allocation was â€œabove all a lack of respect towards the citizens of Europeâ€ as the nominations did not account for the increase in support for the right in the elections.Her argument was that the election success of her hard-right European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) grouping, set to be the European Parliamentâ€™s third-largest force, as well as Italyâ€™s standing as the blocâ€™s third-biggest economy, should be reflected in the EU leadership. The EPP and the S&D respectively came first and second in the elections, but Renew came fourth, behind the ECR.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who negotiated last weekâ€™s deal for the EPP, sent a strong signal to Meloni at the summit. â€œThere is no Europe without Italy, and thereâ€™s no decision without Prime Minister Meloni,â€ he told reporters, with similar conciliatory sounds coming from Greece and Cyprus and Austria.Afterwards, Meloni said it would be â€œshamefulâ€ if the European establishment penalised Italy because of her choice to abstain on von der Leyen and vote against the other two top job nominations. â€œI donâ€™t agree that a contrary vote puts our position in the EU at risk,â€ she said.OrbÃ¡n had also denounced the top jobs deal as a stitch-up, saying â€œEuropean voters have been deceivedâ€, though his opposition was not enough to derail the final agreement.Andrej Babis, leader of the Czech liberal-populist ANO party, Herbert Kickl, leader of the right-wing Austrian FPÃ–, and Viktor Orban, Prime Minister of Hungary and leader of the Fidesz party, shake hands.

Photo: Tobias Steinmaurer/APA/dpaFar-right stir trouble ahead of plenary voteAs von der Leyenâ€™s last but least trouble-free step to secure her second term as head of the European Commission – the vote in the European Parliament – approaches, recent political developments could pose additional obstacles to her re-election. While needing the support of the groups, such as the Greens, as well as of Meloni, far-right movements less likely to support her appointment are set to further complicate the process. In France, the potential victory of Marine Le Penâ€™s nationalist and right-wing populist Rassemblement National (RN) party in the French elections looms. Also, Hungary started its presidency of the Council of the EU and the prospect of a far-right alliance in the European Parliament emerged.In the first round of snap elections on June 30 in France, RN came out on top with about 33 percent of the votes, with President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s centrist Ensemble (Together) alliance in third place with about 20 percent.On Sunday, OrbÃ¡n announced an alliance with populist parties from Austria and the Czech Republic at the EU level, dubbed Patriots for Europe, to form a new far-right group in the European Parliament.The Patriots for Europe grouping draws in OrbÃ¡nâ€™s Fidesz party, the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÃ–) and the Czech Republicâ€™s Action of Dissatisfied Citizens, commonly known as ANO (Yes). It should soon gain more members and become the â€œlargest group of right-wing forces in Europeâ€, the Fidesz leader said.This article is published twice a week.

Greenpeace: European cities much better connected by air than rail,"A new Greenpeace study found that there is room for improving the rail infrastructure across Europe. Only 12 percent of all 990 routes analysed can be covered by train while the number of direct flgihts is much higher. Vienna - European cities are much better connected by air than by rail, according to an analysis by the environmental organization Greenpeace.With existing infrastructure alone, it would be possible to create 305 new direct train connections between cities in Europe, according to a new Greenpeace study.The environmental NGO points out that flying is the most climate-damaging mode of transport.On the same route, travelling by plane in Europe is around five times as harmful as travelling by train - with an even greater difference if the train is fuelled by electricity from renewable sources.Greenpeace compared train and air connections between 45 major European cities and analysed the potential for better direct trains.According to the study, only 12% of all 990 routes between cities can be covered by direct trains. The number of direct flights is much higher.Potential for better train infrastructureThere is a lack of direct train connections on well-travelled routes such as Paris-Rome, Madrid-Paris or London-Berlin. With more than 1 million passengers a year on each of these routes, they are among the most travelled routes in Europe. These three routes could be travelled within 10 hours and 30 minutes by direct train, it said.Currently, travellers could leave Paris by train at 8 am and arrive in Copenhagen at 9:30 pm.

Å½iga Faktor: EU elections will have little impact on enlargement policy,"In an interview with the Serbian news agency Tanjug, the Deputy Director and Head of the Brussels office of Europeum, Å½iga Faktor, assessed the extent to which the European Union's enlargement prospects will be affected by the outcome of the recent EU-wide elections.Å½iga Faktor, Deputy Director and Head of the Brussels office at Europeum, an independent think tank focusing on European integration and cohesion, does not expect the results of the 2024 European Parliament elections to have a significant impact on EU enlargement policy, he said in an interview with European Newsroom (enr) member agency Tanjug following the European Parliament elections.Â ""When it comes to the enlargement of the EU, it still falls under the EUâ€™s foreign and security policy, which means that it is still firmly in hand of the member states and the Council,â€ he said. â€œTherefore it [the election results] will not have some dramatic impact, but the results of the elections will definitely somehow shape the direction in which discussions on the side of the European Parliament will be conducted,"" Faktor added.Currently, nine European countries have been granted candidate status and are thus waiting in line to be admitted as a member of the European Union: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, TÃ¼rkiye and Ukraine.Following Russiaâ€™s invasion of its neighbour Ukraine in February 2022, the EUâ€™s enlargement policy rapidly gained momentum. In December 2023, EU leaders agreed to open accession negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova, while granting candidate status to Georgia. In June 2024, negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova began. Negotiations are also ongoing with Albania and North Macedonia (both since 2022) as well as with Montenegro (since 2012) and Serbia (since 2014).Budget shaped by European ParliamentExplaining how the election results could affect the budgetary aspects of enlargement, Faktor pointed at the role of the European Parliament in setting the EUâ€™s budget.The EU budget is adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU, based on a proposal by the European Commission. The European Commission is then responsible for its implementation. ""For example, IPA funds, this can be somehow discussed between the levels of the Council and the Parliament, and this can have some additional obstacles to the financial support to the candidate countries, but the impact in general [will] not be so drastic,"" Faktor believes. With the so-called Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance (IPA), the EU provides financial assistance to some countries in the enlargement region which are currently in the process of preparing for EU membership. Among other things, the funds are intended to support the countries to make the political and economic reforms needed to take on the rights and obligations of EU membership. They also help the EU achieve some of its objectives, such as energy supply, climate change targets, and a sustainable economy.Far-right lacks unified position on enlargementSpeaking about the extent to which the success of right-wing and far-right parties in the European elections could affect the EU's enlargement policy and the implementation of the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans, Faktor said that there could be an impact on economic issues and – again – on the budget. Like the IPA funds, the Growth Plan for the Western Balkans should help countries of the region accelerate both their accession process as well as economic growth. The financial pillar of the plan was adopted by the Council in May and will provide up to 2 billion euros in grants and 4 billion euros in loans to the EU's six Western Balkan partners over the coming years.""I don't think this will anyhow have an impact on the implementation, unless there are some problems from the side of the candidate countries when it comes to the rule of law and European values. It could also affect less accessible funds from the fund,"" said Faktor. Concerning the general agenda of EU enlargement, Faktor pointed out that certain far-right parties are against enlargement due to the issue of migration and the socio-economic impact on the EU member states, and that some of them believe that such problems are related to the member states that finance the new members. However, he stressed that ""there is no unified position when it comes to the far right across the EU towards the enlargement"". Keeping the enlargement process goingLooking to the future, Faktor said that it is absolutely crucial to continue the EU enlargement process in the coming years, that is, in the next decade. ""It is not important only for the geopolitical concerns, it is also important for the implementation of other thematic areas where the EU sees a plan for decarbonisation,â€ Faktor said. â€œWe will be talking about the Green agenda, although maybe in a different shape, we will be talking about migration, we will be talking about competitiveness of the EU, and in all those areas in the end, enlargement for the EU is important,"" he added. He stressed that it is also important to show that the EU stands firmly by its values â€‹â€‹and by the proposal that every European country can join the EU if it meets the conditions for membership.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: The EU after the European elections.

Voter turnout in European Parliament elections remains low,"Just over half of EU voters cast their ballots in the June European elections, according to the European Parliament. With turnout rates varying between the blocâ€™s member states, participation in EU-wide elections remains lower than in respective national parliamentary elections.On 6-9 June, 2024, voters from across the European Union went to the polls to elect the next 720 members of the European Parliament. According to provisional results and data from the European Parliament, 51.06 percent of eligible voters cast their ballot in the 2024 European Parliament elections.Â The figure shows a slight increase compared to the 2019 elections (50.66 percent) and is the highest since 1994 (56.67 percent). However, almost half of the EUâ€™s eligible voters did not participate in the vote for the blocâ€™s only directly elected institution representing their interests.â€œFrom the first direct elections in the 1970s to the ones in 2019, participation decreased all the time – again and again and again,â€ said Stefan Lehne, Senior Fellow at Carnegie Europe in an interview with the European Newsroom (enr). â€œThe big exception was the 2019 elections when it shot up by about 10 percent,â€ he added.â€œThe fact that the relatively high level of 2019 was maintained indicates that the EU is relevant for the life of the people,"" Lehne said. However, he added: â€œThe fact that basically all national parliamentary elections see a much higher participation rate shows that still national politics has primacy over European politics.â€Who did EU citizens vote for?Out of the 720 seats in the Parliament, each of the 27 EU member states is given a fixed amount, which is decided before the elections begin and takes into account the size of each member state's population.The seats are filled by national representatives (MEPs) from different political parties, who are directly elected by EU citizens. In September 2023, MEPs approved EU leadersâ€™ decision to increase the total number of seats from 705 to 720 for the next legislative term.The maximum number of seats to be granted to a country is 96. This is the case for Germany, which has more than 84 million inhabitants. The second largest country, France, has 81 seats with a population of about 68 million.To ensure that EU citizens from all member states are given a minimum level of representation, the lowest number of seats per country is set at 6. This is the case for the blocâ€™s smaller countries such as Malta, Luxembourg and Cyprus. Malta has around 500,000 inhabitants, Luxembourg around 650,000 and Cyprus almost 1.3 million.Gap in turnout rates across EUThe motivation of EU citizens to go to the ballot box and choose their representatives remains low for the EU, and â€œthere are huge differences between member statesâ€ when looking at the turnout rates across the bloc, Lehne pointed out. â€œParticularly in the Central and Eastern European states, the participation rate is still considerably lower than in the rest of Europeâ€.The lowest voter turnout was recorded in Croatia with 21.35 percent, even lower than the already low turnout of 29.85 percent in 2019. Lithuania (28.35 percent compared to 56.48 percent in 2019) is the only other EU country with a voter turnout below 30 percent.The highest turnout was recorded in Belgium, where voting is compulsory under the country's constitution. In Belgium, federal and regional elections took place on the same day as the European elections (9 June). The second and third highest turnout were recorded in Luxembourg (82.29 percent compared to 84.24 in 2019) and Malta (73 percent compared to 72.7 percent in 2019).This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: The EU after the European elections.

Right-wing on the rise: will it change the tone of the EU?,"Italy, France, Germany, Austria: in a number of EU countries, right-wing and far-right parties made significant gains in the 2024 European elections. But will their increased presence have an impact on the direction of EU policy in Brussels?Right-wing parties and far-right made significant gains in several countries in the 2024 European elections. In Italy, prime minister Giorgia Meloni's national conservative and populist Fratelli d'Italia (FdI) party came out on top. In France, Marine Le Pen's right-wing populist Rassemblement National (RN), secured the most votes. In Germany, the right-wing populist Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) achieved its best result to date, coming second behind the conservative CDU/CSU. In Austria, the right-wing Freiheitliche Partei Ã–sterreichs (FPÃ–), became the largest party.Â In the European Parliament, the two groups with the most right-wing and populist political parties, the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) and Identity and Democracy (ID), made some significant gains. But the pro-European camp still remains by far the largest in the European Parliament, with the centre-right European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP) securing the most seats. Even if all the right-wing parties were to join forces, they would probably end up with fewer than 200 seats, far short of the 361-seat majority needed.Italy: Meloni strengthens her position in the EUIn Italy, Fratelli d'Italia scored 28.8 percent of the votes – an increase of more than 20 percentage points compared to the 2019 European elections. A left-wing alliance around the social-democratic Democratic Party (PD) came second with 24.1 percent.Meloni was the lead candidate for Fratelli dâ€™Italia in these European elections, but she does not want to go to the European Parliament as an MEP, preferring to stay in Rome as prime minister. The 47-year-old has led a coalition of three right-wing parties since October 2022. The result is likely to increase her influence at the European level.â€œItaly can present itself at the G7 and in Europe with the strongest government of all,â€ stressed Meloni. According to the Italian prime minister, the European elections have helped her government to consolidate its position. France: Le Pen's far-right nationalists in the leadIn France, the right-wing nationalist and populist RN party led by Marine Le Pen won with 31.4 percent of the votes, more than twice as much as the Renaissance party of current French President Emmanuel Macron. As a result, the head of state announced new elections of the lower house of France's parliament, the National Assembly.The strong showing by Le Pen's party has sparked widespread protests in France. Hundreds of thousands of people marched against her party in France over the weekend following the European elections. Germany: AfD strongest force in eastern GermanyGermany has also moved to the right in the European elections. The right-wing populist Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party came second with 15.9 percent of the votes, an increase of almost five percentage points compared to 2019. The party did even better in the five former East German states, where it came first.  The conservative CDU/CSU alliance, which is currently part of the opposition, won the most votes nationwide, with 30.0 percent. The federal government parties – Social Democrats (Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands, SPD), Greens and Liberals (Freie Demokraten, FDP) – suffered losses and together received just under a third of the vote.Germany's next federal election will take place next year. In the eastern German states of Thuringia, Saxony and Brandenburg, elections to the state parliaments (LÃ¤nder parliaments) will be held this autumn.The most important functions of German state parliaments include electing the respective head of state (prime minister), supervising the state governments and passing state laws.Austria: Right wing takes the lead for the first timeIn Austria, for the first time, the right-wing populists came out on top. The FPÃ–, a member of the ID group in the European Parliament, won 25.4 percent of the votes. The conservative Austrian People's Party (Ã–sterreichische Volkspartei, Ã–VP) secured 24.5 percent. The Social Democratic Party of Austria (Sozialdemokratische Partei Ã–sterreichs, SPÃ–) followed with 23.2 percent.During the election campaign, the FPÃ– often emphasised its scepticism towards the EU with the slogan 'Stop EU madness' and criticised the EU as a warmongering force in relation to Russia's war against Ukraine. For party leader Herbert Kickl, the goal of becoming Austria's next chancellor seems to be getting closer. Austria is due to elect a new parliament this autumn.Can right-wing parties set a new tone for the EU?The course of the EU is primarily determined by the European Council, the body of the 27 heads of state and government. For the time being, the European elections will not change anything dramatically there. In the European Council, which holds regular summits, the parties of the centre-right EPP alliance are currently the strongest political force, with 13 heads of state and government being affiliated with the group. They are followed by the Social Democrats and the Liberals. The only clear right-wing politicians in the European Council so far are Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n.The EPP also remains the strongest political force in the European Parliament. Even if all the right-wing parties joined forces, they would probably end up with less than 200 of the 720 seats – far from a majority. The ECR and ID groups in the European Parliament disagree on a number of fundamental issues. Differences exist not only between the groups, but also within them.â€œIt still remains to be very difficult to nationalists to cooperate on the international level and it plays a big role why they can not impact much on public policy,â€ said Nathalie Brack, Associate Professor of Political Science of Political Science (ULB), in an interview with the European Newsroom (enr) in May.This article is part of the enrâ€™s EU Elections Spotlight: The EU after the European elections.

"Inflation eases in the Eurozone, banking authorities call for caution","The inflation in Europe is easing slightly but banking authorities such as the European Central Bank and the European Banking Authority remain cautious. Consumers across the continent need to fork out more money for services and goods.Â Eurozone inflation at 2.5% in June, down from 2.6% in MayEuropean Central Bank dampens hope for further lowering of interest rates Food and services tend to get more expensive for consumersInflation accelerated rapidly after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022. Energy prices in particular shot upwards, which also impacted the cost of industrially produced goods and imports. The inflation rate peaked at more than 10% in 2022. In June, the European Central Bank (ECB), which is tasked with maintaining price stability, lowered its key interest rates by 0.25 percentage points for the first time since the wave of inflation hit the currency area. If inflation falls in the Eurozone as a whole, it would give the ECB leeway to cut key interest rates further over the course of the year. The ECB considers the 2% inflation mark a key target.ECB President Christine Lagarde sought to dampen expectations of further interest rate cuts. â€œIt will take time for us to gather sufficient data to be certain that the risks of above target inflation have passed,â€ she said during an ECB conference in Portugal earlier this week. The call for caution also comes from the European Banking Authority, which warns credit institutions given the â€œhigh uncertaintyâ€ about economic growth, interest rates and geopolitical risks. Eurostat: Inflation eases year on year in the EurozoneOn July 2, the European statistics office Eurostat published its monthly provisional data estimate showing the inflation rate in the Eurozone standing at 2.5% year-on-year in June (June 2023: 5.5%). The Eurozone is made up of 20 of the 27 EU member states using the Euro currency. Bulgaria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Romania and Sweden are currently non-members. Eurostatâ€™s latest data estimates place Belgium (5.5%), Spain (3.5%), Croatia and the Netherlands (both 3.4%) as those with the highest â€œAll Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP)â€ percentages in June while Finland (0.6%), Italy (0.9%) and Lithuania (1.0%) registered lowest percentages. The HICP, the Harmonised Indices of Consumer Prices, aids with international comparisons of consumer price inflation and includes energy, food, alcohol and tobacco, services and non-energy industrial goods. In short: It gives a comparable overview of how much goods and services purchased by Euro households cost over time. Looking across the EurozoneFrance: In France, where the second round of early legislative elections will be held on July 7, energy prices play a role in campaigning as gas and electricity have largely contributed to fueling inflation and weighing on the French budget in recent years. Preliminary data by the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (Insee) suggests that over a year, the Consumer Price Index should rise by 2.1% in June 2024, after +2.3% in May.The slowdown in food and energy prices over the year could explain this slight ease of inflation. Prices of services, manufactured products and tobacco are expected to rise year on year. Over one month, consumer prices should remain almost stable in June 2024: prices for services are expected to increase while energy and food prices are expected to fall.Germany: Preliminary June inflation figures by Germanyâ€™s Federal Statistical Office released on Monday showed inflation easing again. The Consumer Price Index stood at 2.2% in June 2024 (June 2023: 6.4%), a slight decline from May (2.4%). Core inflation, which excludes volatile prices for food and energy, amounted to 2.9%. While services in particular became more expensive, energy became cheaper in June.Italy: Householdsâ€™ purchasing power has risen by 3.3% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the previous one as inflation has come down according to ISTAT, the Italian National Statistical Institute. However, greater spending power does not always translate into more purchases: Gross disposable income rose by 3.5% while consumer spending only grew by 0.5%.Based on ISTATâ€™s preliminary estimates for June, the HICP increases by 0.2% on a monthly basis and by 0.9% on an annual basis (from +0.8% in the previous month).Spain: According to the National Institute of Statistics (INE), the Consumer Price Index stood at 3.4% in June showing a slight decrease in the year-on-year comparison to June 2023 (3.6%). The INE attributed this evolution to lower fuel prices and – while food prices increased – they did so to a lesser extent than in the same month of 2023. However, â€œentertainment and cultureâ€ offers have become more expensive in June compared to the same month in the previous year. Slovenia: In Slovenia, inflation started to deviate markedly from the 2% target level in autumn 2021, even before Russia invaded Ukraine.Consumer prices rose by 19% from October 2021 to June 2024, according to data from the national Statistical Office. The annual inflation rate peaked at 11% in the summer of 2022. Over the past year, inflation has been slowly moderating, reaching a three-year low in June this year at 1.5%.The second half of 2023 in particular saw a substantial rise in prices of services but despite that, official data show that the standard of living per average Slovenian has not deteriorated in real terms, partly because of significant wage raises.Croatia: In recent years, inflation in Croatia has been slightly higher than the average of the Eurozone, which Croatia joined on January 1, 2023, but lower than in EU countries outside the Eurozone.According to the estimates of the National Bureau of Statistics, the prices of goods and services for personal consumption, measured by the consumer price index, according to the first estimate in June 2024 compared to June 2023, are on average 2.4% higher. Compared to May, they remained the same. Generally speaking, food prices in Croatia have risen in recent years and have come close to prices in Western European countries. Rental prices have skyrocketed thanks to the countryâ€™s tourism boom, economic growth.Chairs are chained together in front of a restaurant. Services have become more expensive for consumers across Europe.  Photo: Sven Hoppe/dpa Looking outside the Eurozone: Sweden, Romania, Bulgaria In Sweden, the government is cautiously claiming victory in the fight against inflation while worrying about the labour market as well as the food industry.â€œIt has been a tough winter, and even if the sun is shining now itâ€™s still not summer in the Swedish economy. We still have a lot of challenges. The unemployment is way too high,â€ said finance minister Elisabeth Svantesson at a press conference last week, adding that competition in the food sector was â€œtoo weakâ€ which leads to â€œhigher prices for consumersâ€. Sweden currently has the third highest unemployment in the EU, after Spain and Greece.Romania: The National Institute of Statistics' (INS) June data shows the inflation rate in Romania at 5.1% in May, down from 5.9% in April. Prices for food, non-food and services increased. Postal services, drugs and detergents saw the largest increases in prices in May 2024, by approximately 25%, compared with the same month last year.According to Eurostat, Romania was the country with the highest inflation in the EU in the first four months of the year. Bulgaria: The main topic of discussion related to Bulgariaâ€™s inflation rate is the countryâ€™s potential accession to the Eurozone. On June 26, the European Commission said that Bulgaria does not meet the price stability criterion for adopting the Euro, according to the European Central Bankâ€™s Convergence Reports.On June 18, Eurostat said that year-to-year inflation in Bulgaria, measured against the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP), accelerated to 2.7% in May, while in April it was 2.5%. Annual inflation in Bulgaria was equal to or lower than the annual inflation in the EU back in August of 2021.EU accession candidates: Albania, North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, SerbiaAlbania: In Albania, the increase in prices has slowed down, allowing breathing space for consumers, after the large increase experienced two years ago. Core inflation continues to decline and is currently at a three-year low. In May, core inflation dropped to 2.3%, from 3.2% at the end of last year and 5.4% in the same period a year ago. The increase in core inflation is the lowest since October 2021. Bosnia and Herzegovina: The annual inflation rate in Bosnia and Herzegovina remained stable at 2% in April, according to the latest data from the Agency for Statistics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. However, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina predicts that overall inflation will increase to 2.9% in the third quarter.The economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is small and heavily dependent on the European Union, its largest trading partner. Therefore, economic trends within the Union are closely monitored. Economic experts see high product prices as a result of excessive dependence on food imports.North Macedonia: North Macedoniaâ€™s annual inflation rate stood at 4.5% in May 2024, the highest since September 2023, up from 4% in April.The increase is mainly driven by accelerated prices for transportation, housing and utilities and restaurants and hotels. In contrast, prices eased for food and non-alcoholic beverages, alcoholic beverages and tobacco as well as clothing and footwear. On a monthly basis, consumer prices increased by 0.9% in May, after a 0.7% increase in the previous month.Serbia: The National Bank of Serbia (NBS) announced that according to the data of the Republic Institute of Statistics, year-on-year inflation slowed down to 4.5% in May, which, in accordance with the projections of the central bank, returned to the limits of the target deviation. According to the current projection, the NBS expects the inflation to continue to slow down until the end of the year.Editor's note: Subheadline adapted, 'Eurozone' instead of 'fiscal union'.

June marks 13th consecutive month of record global average temperature,"According to the EU's climate change service Copernicus, global temperatures in June exceeded the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming limit set by the 2015 Paris Agreement. It was the 13th month in a row in which record temperatures were recorded.Berlin/Brussels (dpa) – Last month was hotter than any June ever recorded, marking the 13th consecutive month in which the global average temperature reached a record value for the respective month, the EU's climate change service Copernicus said on Monday.Temperatures in June were also 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, marking the 12th consecutive month in which the 1.5-degree-Celsius mark was met or surpassed, according to the monthly report.For the period from July 2023 to June 2024, the global temperature was 1.64 degrees above the pre-industrial average, according to Copernicus data.At the 2015 climate conference in Paris, the global community set itself the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial levels. The EU and all its member states signed and ratified the agreement, signifying their commitment to its implementation. The EU also wants to be the first to become climate neutral by 2050.While the EU climate scientists acknowledged that a series of 13 months of record warmth was ""unusual,"" they pointed to a similar series of monthly global temperature records in 2015 and 2016.The average surface air temperature for June was 16.66 degrees, 0.67 degrees above the average level recorded for the month between 1991 and 2020 and 0.14 degrees above the previous record set in June 2023, according to the report.The average European temperature in June exceeded the average value for the month from 1991 to 2020 by 1.57 degrees, making it the second warmest June since records began in Europe.According to the report, temperatures were particularly high in the south-east of the continent and in TÃ¼rkiye, while temperatures in western Europe, Iceland and north-west Russia were close to or below average.Meanwhile, last June was ""wetter than average"" in Iceland, central Europe and large parts of south-western Europe, ""with heavy precipitation leading to floods in regions of Germany, Italy, France and Switzerland.""

"French election: surprise win for the left, EU leaders â€œrelievedâ€","The French left-wing alliance New Popular Front has won a surprise victory in Sundayâ€™s legislative elections. Some EU leaders are hailing the result as a relief for European integration, averting a French government led by nationalists and eurosceptics. France now enters a period of political uncertainty as it tries to form a new government.Contrary to all expectations and polls prior to Sundayâ€™s French legislative elections, the left-wing alliance New Popular Front (NFP) came out on top in the second round of voting – ahead of current President Emmanuel Macronâ€™s liberal Together (Ensemble) bloc, to which his party Renaissance belongs, while pushing Marine Le Penâ€™s far-right populist National Rally (RN) party to third place.The outcome has plunged the country into political uncertainty unprecedented in its recent history.France voted in the final round of snap legislative elections which French President Emmanuel Macron called after his camp suffered losses in last monthâ€™s European Parliament elections. RN, led by the 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, won the most votes (37.1 percent) at the time.With 577 seats in the French National Assembly, the latest projections put the NFP in first place with 188 seats. Macronâ€™s Together alliance and Le Penâ€™s RN followed with 161 and 142 seats respectively.The NFP – formed only last month – brought the previously deeply divided Socialists, Greens, Communists and France Unbowed (LFI) together as one party alliance. In the European elections at the beginning of June, the parties still ran individually.The biggest NFP component is the hard-left LFI of Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, a divisive figure who is anathema to the right and centre and has alienated many fellow leftists. The alliance's main program lines included a huge increase of the minimum wage as well as cancelling the pension reform in France, reducing the retirement age back to 62 years.MÃ©lenchon was quick to demand that the president Macron appoints a prime minister from the left alliance. He said that the NFP â€œhas to implement its program and only its programâ€, and refused to enter into negotiations with Macronâ€™s coalition.European Union leaders â€œrelievedâ€ after French voteSundayâ€™s result came as a surprise in France. After the first round of voting on June 30, forecasts saw the RN win just under an absolute majority of 289 seats and thus possibly in a position to form the next government – with Bardella poised to become the next prime minister.Despite this strong setback, the RN – driven by its anti-immigration stance – achieved a historic result (142 seats)  in the second round of voting on Sunday, scoring well above the 89 deputies it won in 2022. That already represented an exceptional jump from the eight they had in 2017. â€œThe tide continues to rise and our victory today has only been delayed,â€ said the president of the RN party in the French National Assembly, Le Pen.The flags of European countries and the EU flag in front of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Photo: Frederick FLORIN / AFPFranceâ€™s EU partners are relieved that Le Penâ€™s eurosceptic outfit will not come to power, where they could endanger future European integration and Western support for Ukraine. A French government of right-wing nationalists and Eurosceptics striving to curb the influence of the EU in France seems to have been averted. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez praised the â€œrejection of the radical rightâ€ on Sunday. France opted for â€œa social left that tackles the peopleâ€™s problems with serious and courageous policiesâ€, the socialist politician said on X.Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said on Sunday evening that he was â€œhappyâ€ with the result. â€œIn Paris enthusiasm, in Moscow disappointment, in Kyiv relief,â€ the former European Council president said.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also told reporters he was â€œrelievedâ€, adding that â€œwe hope that the president and the elected MPs will manage to bring about a constructive governmentâ€.French electoral system key to leftist victoryAlthough Sundayâ€™s elections saw the left NFP leading in terms of seats, the far-right RN and its allies were by far the party with the most votes with around 37 percent compared to 26 percent for the NFP. Macronâ€™s liberal Together alliance came in third with around 24 percent of the votes.In the French electoral system, the winning candidate securing the majority of votes in each of the 577 constituencies would be directly elected for a seat in the National Assembly.The left and Macronâ€™s centre forces had formed a coalition of convenience before the second round of voting. In order not to take votes away from each other in constituencies in which three candidates made it to the second round, candidates from the left or centre blocs in several constituencies withdrew strategically. That way, the remaining candidate had a better chance of beating the RN candidate. NFP and Together both called on their voters to vote against the RN in any case.Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said that the far-right RN party was the â€œconvincing relative winnerâ€ of the French elections because it received the most votes, but its victory was prevented by the countryâ€™s electoral system. â€œThe message has remained and will be seen very soon, in a little less than three years when French presidential elections take place,â€ he added. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also said that â€œif we look at what happened in France, no one can claim victoryâ€. She added that â€œnone of the three established themselves, none of the three are capable of governing aloneâ€.French Prime Minister Gabriel Attal. Photo: Miguel MEDINA / AFPFrance in political limboFollowing the elections, the Eurozoneâ€™s second largest economy is entering a period of political limbo and instability just weeks ahead of the Paris Olympics.The unforeseen political landscape left by the second round of elections anticipates a hugely divided National Assembly without clear majorities, so the governability of France enters a very uncertain coalition-building phase, even more so as it is a country without a tradition of coalitions or alliances.If no bloc can find a majority to form a government, the current government could conduct business on an interim basis, or an expert government could be appointed. In such a scenario, France would face a political deadlock. A new dissolution of parliament by Macron and fresh elections would not be possible until July 2025.Following the election, Prime Minister Gabriel Attal of Macronâ€™s Renaissance party presented his resignation to the president. Macron refused, asking Attal to remain in power in a caretaker capacity to see out the Olympic Games and reassure the international community and the markets that France still has a government.Sources from the ElysÃ©e announced that Macron, who is currently in Washington to participate in the NATO summit, will take his time until the new National Assembly is established to decide on the future government that has to be formed.To appoint a new prime minister, Macron could wait until after the parliamentary summer recess. However, the newly elected National Assembly will already hold its first session on July 18, where the president of the parliament will be elected. The following day, decisions will be made about the vice presidents and the composition of committees.This article is published twice a week.

"Hungary’s Orbán justifies Moscow visit in leaked letter to EU leaders
","Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n visited Russian President Vladimir Putin â€“ without informing the EU and its leaders â€“ to discuss the war in Ukraine. Hungary currently holds the presidency of the Council of the EU.Brussels (dpa) – Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n justified his unannounced trip to Russia by citing the economic impact of the Ukraine war on the European Union.""The negative economic effects of the war place a great burden on the everyday lives of our citizens and on the competitiveness of the EU,"" OrbÃ¡n said in the report, dated July 5, and addressed to European Council President Charles Michel and EU leaders.Hungary currently holds the six-months presidency of the Council of the EU, which began on July 1. Several EU officials and heads of state and government were furious at OrbÃ¡n's decision to travel to Russia without consulting his EU counterparts.OrbÃ¡n visited Moscow to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin immediately after his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022. Hungary is viewed in the EU as close to Russia and OrbÃ¡n's short report reflected Putin's view of the war in Ukraine and shared unrealistically high Russian estimates of Ukrainian casualties.Putin believes time is on Russia's side in the conflict, OrbÃ¡n said, and reported the Russian president's surprise that Ukraine had not accepted recent offers of a ceasefire and peace negotiations.OrbÃ¡n repeated Putin's expectation of a rapid collapse of Ukraine in the coming months. This is despite a major Russian offensive on the north-eastern city Kharkiv grinding to a halt and wider Ukrainian victories in Crimea.In his letter, the Hungarian premier told fellow EU leaders that based on his talks with Putin, ""there is now a greater chance"" for a ceasefire and a path towards peace talks."" He urged the bloc to take the initiative in pushing for a ceasefire, as Washington is increasingly focused on the upcoming presidential elections. (9 July)",1
"French, German economists urge EU to boost capital investments","Three leading groups of economists have urged the European Union to build a stronger capital market to boost funding for key developments such as the green transition and artificial intelligence, as well as to help boost the bloc's competitiveness.Brussels (dpa) – Several top German and French economic advisors have called for renewed efforts to boost the European Union's capital markets and encourage more private investment in a joint statement on Thursday.""Like most advanced economies, the EU is suffering from a long-term decline in growth potential. New opportunities like the green transition or the rise of artificial intelligence have emerged, but our capacity to fund the investments and benefit from these opportunities remains uncertain,"" said the French Council of Economic Analysis (CAE), the German Council of Economic Experts (GCEE) and the Franco-German Council of Economic Experts (FGCEE).""We need to build a stronger, deeper capital market to face these challenges,"" the joint statement said.Currently, private households in Europe predominantly hold their savings in low-return asset classes such as bank deposits, the groups said in the statement. According to a report published in April, there are 33 trillion euros (36 trillion dollars) in private savings in the EU, most of which is held in cash and bank deposits.The EU is seeking to attract more regular people to invest in local financial markets to make more capital available for the green and digital transition, as well as boost investment in private companies and start-ups.To this end, work has been under way for years to bring the European Union's capital and financial markets together in what has been termed the capital markets union (CMU). The aim is to reduce bureaucratic hurdles between EU countries in order to give companies more opportunities to raise money across the bloc.After years without much progress, leaders of EU member states recently spoke out again in favour of pushing the project forward in order to boost the EU's global competitiveness.

"Srebrenica Genocide: UN resolution sparks Balkan debate, EU stands firm","29 years after the Srebrenica massacre the UN General Assembly adopts a resolution on Srebrenica genocide and establishes an International Day of Reflection and Commemoration. The vote is controversial among Balkan countries, but the EU made its continous position clear in an official statement â€“ â€œthere is no placeâ€ in the EU for those who deny the Srebrenica genocide and try to â€œrewrite the historyâ€. Europe and the world commemorated the 29th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide, often described as the worst crime committed on European soil since World War II. Ceremonies were held at the PotoÄari Memorial Centre in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH), and also in many European countries and in the United States.The massacre took place in the Bosnian city of Srebrenica on July 11, 1995 and on subsequent days. Most of the victims were Bosniak men and boys – Bosnian Muslims – who had been separated from the women, girls and small children who were bused to territory controlled by the Bosnian army.According to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former YugoslaviaÂ in The Hague (ICTY), around 8,000Â Bosniaks were killed in the massacre, which was perpetrated by Serbian soldiers from BiH. According to the Institute for Missing Persons of BiH, about 800 victims are still being searched for.The remains of 14 genocide victims identified over the past year, including one minor, were buried on July 11, 2024 at the Memorial Center in PotoÄari, where a total of 6,751 victims have been laid to rest.  Coffins with remains of 14 newly identified victims are seen at PotoÄari Memorial Centre ahead of the burial in PotoÄari, near Srebrenica, Bosnia And Herzegovina July 10, 2024. Photo: picture alliance/PIXSELL/Armin DurgutThe Bosnia and Herzegovina war between Croats, Muslims (Bosniaks) and Serbs claimed approximately 100,000 lives between 1992 and 1995. Nearly three decades since the war ended, the Balkan nation remains deeply divided along ethnic lines.The UN had placed Srebrenica under its protection in 1993. A Dutch unit of peacekeepers was tasked with protecting the refugees in the enclave. But on July 11, 1995, units of Serbs from BiH overran Srebrenica. The peacekeepers failed to protect the victims. In 2022, the Netherlands apologised to the victimsâ€™ families for their part in the failure to protect them.Punishment of perpetratorsThe ICTY and the International Court of Justice in The Hague (ICJ) have established legally that genocide was perpetrated.The political head of the Serbs from BiH at the time, Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ‡, and Ratko MladiÄ‡, the commander of the Army of Republika Srpska, were handed life sentences by the ICTY. In addition to the leaders, at least 47 others involved were convicted of crimes in Srebrenica, receiving a total of more than 700 years in prison.Denial of the Srebrenica genocide is virtually state policy in Serbia and in the Serbian part of Bosnia and Herzegovina (the entity in BiH where Serbs are the majority), known as Republika Srpska. The perpetrators are seen as heroes by many there.Adoption of the UN ResolutionThe 1995 Srebrenica genocide will in future be marked around the world on July 11, following a vote by the United Nations General Assembly in New York, in late May this year.The day is to be officially marked from next year, 30 years after the event.The resolution written by Germany and Rwanda – countries synonymous with genocide in the 20th century – received 84 votes in favor, 19 against with 68 abstentions and makes July 11 â€œInternational Day of Remembrance of the Srebrenica Genocideâ€.Supporters included the US, the UK, most of the EU, numerous Muslim countries and the whole of the former Yugoslavia, with the exception of Serbia, among others. China and Russia voted against the UN resolution, as did Hungary (member of EU). Three EU member states, Cyprus, Slovakia and Greece, abstained. The vote caused an international stir and controversy among the Balkan countries. Some states had differing positions internally. For example Bulgaria, where according to media reports the cabinet of caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev had tried to withdraw from the UN resolution.Sources claim that a cable from Glavchev to Bulgariaâ€™s UN Permanent Representative Lachezara Stoeva demanded a last-minute change in Bulgariaâ€™s position before the UN vote on the Srebrenica resolution. Stoeva allegedly ignored Glavchevâ€™s instructions and Bulgaria supported the resolution, which it had co-authored.Commenting on Bulgariaâ€™s position, the countryâ€™s President, Rumen Radev, said that it is inappropriate for the government to show hesitation and inconsistency given that the country was a co-author.Tension between Serbia and Bosnia-HerzegovinaThe adoption of the resolution was met with fierce opposition from the Serbian government and  the leaders of Serbs from BiH, who keep downplaying the atrocity and refuse to recognise it as genocide.The president of Serbia, Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡, who traveled specifically to New York for the vote, harshly attacked the text, arguing that, far from bringing reconciliation between Bosniaks and Serbs in BiH, it will â€œopen Pandora's boxâ€ and foster â€œa division and a regional crisis in the Balkansâ€.Last April, the Parliament of the Republika Srpska, one of the two entities that make up Bosnia and Herzegovina, adopted a document denying the 1995 genocide in Srebrenica, which has been acknowledged as documented and proven by the ICTY.The document also asserts that the victims of the massacre were not civilians, as the The Hague court considered proven, but rather â€œprisoners of warâ€, and estimates their number at â€œbetween 1,500 and 2,000, at most 3,000â€ (compared to the 8,000 determined by the judges in The Hague).Contrasting views within Bosnia and HerzegovinaThe commemoration of the Srebrenica genocide on July 11 is not officially conducted at the state level in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to deep political divisions within the country.For the fifth consecutive year, the Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not decide to declare July 11 a day of mourning. This proposal was rejected due to the veto rights of the deputy chairman from the entity of Republika Srpska.Commemoration of the 29th anniversary of the Srebrenica genocide. Photo: FENA/Hazim AljoviÄ‡The National Assembly of Republika Srpska adopted a statement protesting the UN Resolution, and the president of that entity, Milorad Dodik, said that the approval of the resolution would cause irreparable damage and â€œmark the end of BiHâ€. He threatened that Republika Srpska, where Srebrenica is located, would secede from Bosnia and Herzegovina.On the other hand, numerous local and international officials highlight the importance of commemorating the Srebrenica genocide, as it serves as a reminder of the ongoing commitment to building a safer and fairer future for all. EU warns: â€œNo placeâ€ in the Union for those who deny the Srebrenica massacreThe European Unionâ€™s High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, and Commissioner for Neighborhood and Enlargement, OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi, issued a joint statement on the genocide anniversary.â€œThe Srebrenica genocide is one of the darkest moments in modern European history. We call on leaders to reject divisive rhetoric and work towards truth, justice, trust, and dialogue,â€ they wrote in the joint statement on Tuesday. Both said  that â€œthere is no placeâ€ in the EU for those who deny the Srebrenica genocide, try to â€œrewrite the historyâ€ and â€œglorify war criminalsâ€.They also recalled that theÂ EU leaders' agreementÂ to open membership talks for Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 2024 is a ""key opportunity"" for the country to ""advance reforms"" that will strengthen democracy.â€œWe reiterate our unequivocal commitment to the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the EU as a single, united and sovereign country,â€ they added.Furthermore, the European Commission, asked on Tuesday in a press conference about the â€œpossibility of suspendingâ€ the negotiations with Serbia if the countryâ€™s authorities opposed the condemnation of the genocide, affirmed possible repercussions on the respective evaluations for accession.""If someone acts against the EU principles and basic criteria, this will be reflected in the Commissionâ€™s recommendations or in the decisions of the Member States when deciding the steps to follow for that specific country""spokesperson for the European CommissionEuropean leaders further highlighted that â€œhealing the wounds of the pastâ€ requires â€œrecognizing and teaching historical facts, honoring and remembering the victims, identifying those still missing and bringing all perpetrators to justiceâ€.At the conference about genocide in Sarajevo ahead of the 29th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre, Sloveniaâ€™s President NataÅ¡a Pirc Musar stressed that the international community has a duty to stop genocidal acts. The president said this is important not only because of the atrocities that took place in Srebrenica but also because of the atrocities caused by the broken promise of â€œnever againâ€ around the world.Pirc Musar called for continuous efforts to recognise and prevent genocidal acts and preserve human dignity for all, referring to the situation in Gaza. â€œWhat is going on in Gaza is a defeat of humanity. Politicians must stop looking away and must act against genocidal behaviour.â€This article is published twice a week. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
Germany to impose temporary controls on French border for Olympics,"Although Germany is a member of the European Unionâ€™s Schengen free movement zone, the country will impose border controls with France from July 26 to August 11 due to the Olympic Games in Paris.Berlin (dpa) – Germany will impose temporary border controls along its border with France in the runup to the Olympic Games in Paris starting on July 26, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser announced in Berlin on Sunday.The move is being undertaken in cooperation with the French authorities with the aim of providing greater security to the Olympics, which end on August 11. The European Commission is to be notified about the measures shortly.Germany and all its immediate neighbours are members of the Schengen Area, which guarantees free movement across most borders within the European Union. Under European law, countries in the Schengen Area may only reintroduce border checks if there is a serious threat to public policy or internal security.Checks introduced along the borders to Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, imposed during the European Football Championships which concluded last Sunday, will be lifted on Friday. Checks will then revert to dragnet controls with targeted checks, as in the past.Border controls continue to be in place along Germany's borders with Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Poland with the aim of countering irregular migration and combating human trafficking.Faeser rejected calls from German opposition parties and from the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP), a junior member of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition, for retaining stricter controls along all borders. This would have serious consequences for commuters, travellers and business, the interior minister said. It would also need to be justified under European law. (14 July)",1
European Parliament convenes as new far-right groups enter its halls,"The European Parliament is holding its first plenary session since the European elections in June this week. Newly-formed far-right groups are taking the stage and MEPs from the 27 EU member states are reshaping the 720-member institution for the next five-year legislative term.The European Parliament convenes this week for the first time since the June elections, with a bolstered far-right demanding more influence in the 720-member assembly.On Tuesday, the 45-year-old Maltese conservative Roberta Metsola was re-elected as President of the European Parliament for a two-and-a-half-year term. After her mandate, a socialist will succeed her for the same duration.The election result in June was characterised by a shift to the right in the European Union and the striking reorganisation of far-right groups in the parliament in the aftermath.The far-right made significant gains in the June elections, although the centrist coalition made up of the conservative European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP), the centre-left Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and the liberal Renew is still the largest with each holding 188, 136 and 77 seats respectively.Two newly established far-right groups entered the Parliamentâ€™s halls on Tuesday: the Patriots for Europe (PfE) – created by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n – and Europe of Sovereign Nations (ESN) – a smaller camp that includes the Alternative for Germany (AfD) and Franceâ€™s ReconquÃªte. These two groups are seen as politically radioactive.With 84 MEPs from twelve countries – led by French Rassemblement National (RN) chief Jordan Bardella – the PfE group is now the third-largest force in the European Parliament, followed by the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) with 78 seats.The ESN group – created by the far-right AfD – brings together 25 MEPs from eight countries. It has two co-presidents, RenÃ© Aust from the AfD and StanisÅ‚aw Tyszka from the Polish far-right populist alliance Konfederacja (Confederation).Patriots for Europe group accused of serving RussiaThe far-right PfE and ESN groups are a red line for the centrist coalition (EPP, S&D and Renew). European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen – who will undergo a vote in Parliament for a second term on Thursday – said that there will be no dialogue with them. EPP leader Manfred Weber said that â€œwhoever is against the EU cannot represent itâ€.Patriots spokesperson Alonso de Mendoza argued that a â€œcordon sanitaireâ€ – a strategy employed by mainstream political parties to block the far-right – was â€œundemocraticâ€.Andrej BabiÅ¡ (ANO), Herbert Kickl (FPÃ–) and Viktor Orban (Fidesz) launch the 'Patriots for Europe' alliance. Photo: Tobias Steinmaurer/APA/dpa)The creation of the PfE group was announced at the end of June by the leader of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÃ–) Herbert Kickl, Hungaryâ€™s Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n (Fidesz) and former Czech Prime Minister Andrej BabiÅ¡ of the populist ANO party. In Austria, representatives from other parties in the European Parliament think little of the new group. In a press release, the delegation leader of the Austrian Peopleâ€™s Party (Ã–VP), Reinhold Lopatka, called them â€œthe accomplices of the warmonger Putin in Europeâ€ and does not expect them to do productive work in the Parliament. â€œThe self-proclaimed patriots for Europe are not interested in the further development of the EU, but solely in its weakening,â€ said Lopatka.In the Czech Republic, Prime Minister Petr Fiala said on X that the PfE group is knowingly or unknowingly serving Russiaâ€™s interests and thus threatening the security and freedom of Europe. BabiÅ¡ dismissed the comments and said that ANO has never colluded with the Kremlin. In response to Fialaâ€™s remarks, ANO representatives did not attend a meeting of Czech MEPs with the prime minister last Friday.Former Portuguese ambassador and now MEP for the Portuguese right-wing populist Chega party, AntÃ³nio TÃ¢nger CorrÃªa, has previously said that he was in favour of a solution to the conflict in Ukraine that made Russia comfortable. Later he changed his position, after backlash from some members of his party, saying that Ukraine should be the one setting the terms.Far-right remains splinteredIn addition to the Hungarian Fidesz and the French RN, the PfE group also includes Italyâ€™s Lega, Spainâ€™s Vox, the Dutch Freedom Party (PVV), the Danish Peopleâ€™s Party, the Portuguese Chega and the Belgian Vlaams Belang. It also includes other MEPs from the Czech Republic (Oath and Motorists), Latvia (Latvia First) and Greece (Voice of Reason), as well as a satellite party of the Hungarian Fidesz called KDNP.But in the EU legislature, the far-right remains fragmented – with far-right and Eurosceptic parties separating themselves between different groups.Previously, the biggest Eurosceptic faction was the ECR, dominated by the Brothers of Italy (FdI) party of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who has toned down her previous euroscepticism in power. The other was the Identity and Democracy (ID) group – which does not exist any longer – previously dominated by the French RN and which took a more anti-EU stance.In Belgium, for example, the far-right anti-immigration and nationalist party Vlaams Belang joined the PfE group. The party won the most votes in the European elections and secured three seats in the European Parliament. But Belgium also held federal elections simultaneously, in which the nationalist party New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) won the most votes. In the European Parliament, N-VA decided it would remain in the European ECR group. In Poland, the far-right Konfederacja alliance split in two: three of the countryâ€™s six elected MEPs have joined the ESN group, while two others are negotiating to join Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s Patriots.Slovenia and Slovakia enter fifth legislative cycleIn Slovenia and Slovakia, MEPs appear to remain most numerous in the parties of the centrist coalition.During the new term of the Parliament, Slovenia will have nine MEPs: five for the EPP, one for the S&D, two for Renew and one for the Greens. For the first time since 2004 when Slovenia joined the EU, a Slovenian MEP will be one of the vice-chairs of the EPP Group. Another Slovenian MEP will be vice-chair of the Renew group.Slovakia, however, will have the weakest representation in the EPP group since its accession to the EU in 2004. Out of 15 MEPs, only one will be in the EPP, six will join the Renew group, one will join the new ESN group and the remaining seven will be non-attached.In the previous four cycles of Slovakiaâ€™s presence in the European Parliament, Slovaks had been the most numerous in the EPP fraction. In the first cycle from 2004 to 2009 Slovakia had eight MEPs out of 14 in the EPP. In the previous cycle from 2019 to 2024 there were first five, then four out of 14.Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, speaks at a press conference at the end of an EU summit in March. On Thursday, MEPs will vote on whether the German will get another term at the helm of the Commission. Photo: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP/dpaWhatâ€™s next for the new European Parliament?As war rages on Europeâ€™s doorstep, the bloc faces multiple challenges including a stagnant economy and growing global uncertainty, which EU leaders and MEPs alike will have to confront head-on after their election.But all eyes will be on Thursdayâ€™s vote when lawmakers decide whether to give Ursula von der Leyen another five years as Commission chief, seen as the most powerful role in the EU. Since EU leaders struck a hard-fought deal on her candidacy in late June, von der Leyen has been scrambling to win over lawmakers in the main political groups.To secure the mandate, the German conservative needs at least 361 votes in the 720-seat chamber. It could be a tight race – in 2019, she secured the post by only nine votes.This article is published twice a week. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
"EU countries struggle integrating Ukrainian refugees, German IAB reports","Germany and other EU countries are struggling to integrate Ukrainian refugees into their labour market, to which Ukrainians have access under a temporary protection mechanism introduced by the EU in 2022.Nuremberg, Germany (dpa) – Many European Union member states are struggling to integrate Ukrainian refugees into their labour markets, according to a study published by Germany's Institute for Employment Research (IAB) on Wednesday.The IAB found that Germany achieved an integration rate of 27 percent at the beginning of 2024. Across Europe, Lithuania leads with 57 percent, followed by Denmark with 53 percent and Poland with 48 percent. Countries such as Finland, Norway, Romania and Spain have the lowest rates, at less than 20 percent.Following Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the EU introduced a temporary protection mechanism for Ukrainian refugees. Among other things, the mechanism gives them better access to the blocâ€™s labour market.""Countries with high demand for low-skilled labour have higher employment rates,"" says IAB division head Yuliya Kosyakova, who comes from Ukraine herself. These jobs require fewer language and other skills and can be filled more quickly. In countries with rising unemployment figures, competition for jobs is greater, which makes integration more difficult.German government figures show that more than one million people have fled from Ukraine to Germany since the start of the war – often women with their children. According to the federal government, 135,000 of them were working in Germany in April. In June, 112,000 were still on an integration course, which is primarily aimed at teaching them German. Germany adopts a ""language first"" principle, emphasising a long-term approach to integration, which lowers short-term employment rates. (17 July)",1
Germany's Scholz rejects Zelensky call to shoot down Russian missiles,"Leaders of 43 European countries and the European Union took part in the fourth European Political Community Summit in Woodstock (United Kingdom) on Thursday to talk about energy and connectivity, security and democracy and migration.London (dpa) – German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Thursday rejected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's call for Western allies to shoot down Russian missiles and drones over Ukrainian territory.At a European Political Community (EPC) summit in Blenheim Palace near Oxford, Scholz said such a move – as well as Zelensky's request for the lifting of restrictions on Kiev's use of Western weapons on Russian territory – was ""out of the question.""The fourth EPC summit since its establishment in 2022 brought together 43 heads of state and government, including all member states of the European Union as well as Ukraine. The EU was represented by European Council President Charles Michel. The only European countries not taking part are Russia and Belarus.Zelensky had earlier asked Western powers to protect Ukrainian airspace, as they did Israel's when Iran launched a massive missile and drone attack in April. ""There must be a collective will to shoot them down just as there was with the Iranian missiles and drones,"" Zelensky said.The Ukrainian president also demanded greater freedom to use Western weapons on Russian territory, noting their role in halting a Russian advance in Ukraineâ€™s north-eastern Kharkiv region in May.At the summit, Ukraine signed security agreements with the Czech Republic and Slovenia, valid for 10 years. Kiev has already concluded such agreements with almost two dozen states, including Germany, and the EU. (18 July)",1
Ursula von der Leyen re-elected as European Commission presidentÂ ,"The German conservative Ursula von der Leyen on Thursday was re-elected by Members of the European Parliament in Strasbourg, France. She will lead the Commission for another five-year term after having been at the helm of the EU since 2019 as the first female executive ever.Â The European Parliament (EP) voted in favour of a second Ursula von der Leyen term in the European Commission with 401 votes on Thursday afternoon during its first parliamentary session since the European elections in early June.Â Von der Leyen was re-elected in a secret ballot vote. The European Parliament has 720 seats but is currently made up of 719 members as the Spanish MEP Antoni Comin has not yet taken up his mandate. The necessary majority to secure a second term was 360 votes. 284 lawmakers voted against, there were 15 abstentions and sevenÂ invalid votes. While von der Leyen in 2019 only secured the post by nine votes, her majority this time is much larger.Â Her successful re-election to lead the powerful commission is a strong signal of stability for the European Union during testing times of war and political instability heightened by the strengthening of the far-right.Â https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1813916725991354676With the backing of EU leaders and the European Parliament, the German politician will have to get straight to work choosing her next cabinet of commissioners, known as a â€œcollegeâ€, to work on EU policy in key areas. From mid-August, she will start interviewing the candidates proposed by European governments.During her second term, she will likely have to face a growing list of issues to tackle, including war in Ukraine and the risk of a wider conflict in the Middle East as well as the EUâ€™s trade tensions with China and the possibility of a second Trump presidency on the other side of the Atlantic.Â Parliament members cast their vote after the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP) politician presented her agenda for the next term earlier in the morning to the lawmakers in Strasbourg.What are von der Leyenâ€™s goals for the second term?Â Â In her speech prior to the vote, the German politician outlined her plans for a second term in the EUâ€™s highest office, focussing on defence and industry and tackling a housing crisis. The re-election pitch also included stern words for Hungaryâ€™s Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, advocating for a â€œstrong Europe'' as well as concrete plans to strengthen the EU border and coastguard agency Frontex and to cut greenhouse gas emissions.The former German defence minister advocated for a â€œstrong Europeâ€ in a â€œperiod of deep anxiety and uncertaintyâ€.Â â€œIâ€™m convinced that Europe, a strong Europe, can rise to the challenge,â€ she said during a speech in the European Parliament. â€œI will never accept that demagogues and extremists destroy our European way of life, and I stand here today ready to lead the fight with all the democratic forces here in this house.â€She vowed to strengthen the Frontex â€œwhile fully respecting fundamental rightsâ€, proposing to triple the number of guards.Â During her speech, she also mentioned the need for an â€œimmediate and enduringâ€ ceasefire in Gaza as too many civilians in the Palestinian territory â€œhave lost their lives as a result of Israelâ€™s response to Hamas' brutal terrorâ€.Von der Leyen also promised to target cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2040. This objective is a key step towards achieving the carbon neutrality by 2050 goal. Von der Leyen told EU lawmakers that â€œthe new clean industrial deal will also help bring down energy billsâ€.Besides that, she criticised Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s recent visit to Moscow, calling it â€œnothing but an appeasement missionâ€. Hungary currently holds the rotating presidency of the Council of the EU. Von der Leyen this week ordered top EU officials to stay away from a series of meetings Hungary was to host as part of its EU presidency, and to send lower-ranking civil servants only.Weeks of rallying support successfulÂ Throughout her first term, the 65-year-old has weathered several crises like the Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine – and also faced many controversies.Dealing a blow to von der Leyen a day before the vote, a top EU court ruled she failed to be transparent enough about coronavirus vaccine contracts.Von der Leyen has held weeks of negotiations with lawmakers to push them to back her, including those who made it clear that they have no intention to support her. She has met with a number of parliamentary groups including the Social Democrats (S&D), the Liberals (Renew), the Greens and the Conservatives (ECR) but also with national delegations and even individual MEPs, with a particular focus on the Greens.To be elected, the EPP politician needed at least 360 votes. The EPP – the biggest group in the parliament – is in a centrist alliance with the Socialists and Democrats (S&D) and Renew Europe groups. Theoretically, the coalition had the numbers to get von der Leyen re-elected. However, expectations were that some lawmakers within those groups would vote against her whereas some Green and European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) lawmakers could vote for her.Â â€œAt the moment, Ursula von der Leyen is fighting for every vote. Things are not clear-cut, because there may be a decision of the political groups to support, but this does not mean that every single MEP is not free in this secret ballot to decide whether to support Ursula von der Leyen or not,â€ Bulgarian MEP Andrey Kovatchev (EPP) explained earlier this week.Â Â A Renew lawmaker said voting for von der Leyen â€œdoesnâ€™t mean giving her a blank chequeâ€.While the vote is secret, some lawmakers have openly communicated their stance. Italian Deputy Premier and Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said his Forza Italia party – which is part of EPP – will vote for von der Leyen, after she presented her political guidelines on Thursday.Fellow Deputy Premier and Transport Minister Matteo Salvini said Italyâ€™s Lega party, which is part of the newly established far-right Patriots for Europe, would vote against her. Carlo Fidanza, the head of the Brothers of Italy (FdI) delegation in the EP said after the vote that the right-wing group had voted against von der Leyen. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who leads the FdI party and heads the ECR group in the European Parliament, had been furious that the group had been left out of the negotiations for the EU top jobs at the end of June.Portugalâ€™s far-left Left Bloc (BE), and Communist Party (PCP) and far-right Chega said they planned to vote against von der Leyen. Speaking to Portuguese journalists on the sidelines of the plenary session in Strasbourg, Left Bloc MEP Catarina Martins listed the â€œissues of war and peaceâ€, the â€œshamefulâ€ migration pact as well as an economic governance package â€œpromising more austerity for Europeâ€ as justifications for voting against the German. Centre-right parties CDS – Peopleâ€™s Party (CDS-PP) and Social Democratic Party (PDS) said they would vote in favour.Â While the green light for a second von der Leyen term has been met with praise by many such as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, French President Emmanuel Macron, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Serbian President Aleksandar VuÄiÄ‡ or Slovenian Prime Minister Robert Golob, some MEPs have reacted more reluctantly.After the vote, Romana Tomc, a Slovenian EPP member said von der Leyen â€œwas never our choiceâ€ and MatjaÅ¾ Nemec from S&D wrote that her re-election wasnâ€™t sending an encouraging message. Irena Joveva (Renew) however expects the German politician to keep the commitments she made.Â From left to right: Roberta Metsola after being re-elected President of the European Parliament (Photo: EFE/EPA/Ronald Wittek)Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (Photo: dpa/Boris Roessler)European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen (L) and Estonia's outgoing Prime Minister Kaja Kallas (Photo: EFE/EPA/Olivier Hoslet/PoolWomen on top of the EU Ursula von der Leyen is one of three – possibly soon four – women holding the five EU top jobs.The Maltese EPP politician Roberta Metsola has been re-elected as European Parliament president on Tuesday, extending her position for another 2,5 years.The French politician and lawyer Christine Lagarde holds the position of European Central Bank chief – as the first woman to do so – and will remain in the role until 2027.Kaja Kallas, Estoniaâ€™s outgoing prime minister, is tapped to take over the post of EU foreign policy chief from Spainâ€™s Josep Borrell.

Europol warns of increase in AI-assisted cybercrime in the EU,"Cybercrime and fraud using artificial intelligence are on the rise in the EU, according to a report by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation â€“ better known as Europol.Amsterdam/The Hague (dpa) – Hacking, sexual exploitation of children and financial fraud are the most worrying trends when it comes to cybercrime in the European Union, according to an analysis released on Monday by the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation (Europol). The report also warned that artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an ever-growing role.Millions of citizens in the EU are victims of organised crime online every day, the European Union's police authority based in The Hague said. Criminals are increasingly targeting small and medium-sized companies, which may be less likely to have advanced tools to protect their data from ransomware attacks, Europol said.Meanwhile, the EU agency said users continue to fall victim to phishing campaigns and other forms of financial fraud. The number of cases of online sexual extortion targeting vulnerable minors is also increasing, it said.Europol also raised the alarm about AI-assisted cybercrime, which is more and more starting to pose a significant challenge to law enforcement authorities. It noted particular concern for the creation of child sexual abuse materials with the use of AI, as well as AI-enabling sophisticated blackmail methods used by scammers and those looking to groom children.According to the analysis, deepfake video and audio are also being widely deployed. For example, voices can be copied for phone calls to extort money or bank access data. AI is also used to manipulate videos or images showing the sexual abuse of children. (22 July)",1
Delivery Hero under EU investigation for alleged cartel activity,"The European Commission has announced an investigation into German food delivery company Delivery Hero, following suspicions that its acquisition of Spanish company Glovo breached European Union competition rules.Brussels (dpa) – In a press release on Tuesday, the European Commission announced an investigation into possible cartel activity by German food delivery company Delivery Hero.Delivery Hero acquired Glovo, a Spain-based food delivery company, in July 2022, after previously holding a minority stake in the company since 2018. According to the bloc's top competition authority, Glovo and Delivery Hero are two of the largest food delivery companies in the EU.The European Union's top competition watchdog suspects that prior to the acquisition, the companies carved up ""geographic markets and shared commercially sensitive information."" Competition law does not permit companies to collude in ways that discourage competition.The Commission also said it was concerned ""that the companies may have agreed not to poach each other's employees."" Competition regulation prohibits such activity as it undermines competition between employers in the labour market. Delivery Hero's minority share in Glovo could have facilitated this activity.An in-depth investigation is to take place, but the decision to pursue a probe of Delivery Hero does not prejudice the outcome. Before the announcement, the Commission conducted surprise inspections of Delivery Hero and Glovo in June 2022 and November 2023 to investigate ""possible collusion."" (July 23)",1
"EU reacts on Orbán’s ‘peace mission’ and moves key ministers’ meeting from Budapest to Brussels
","The Hungarian presidency of the Council of the European Union has been marred by controversy, which escalated after Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's unexpected visits to Russia and China. In response, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a boycott and the EU's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, blocked a planned informal meeting of foreign and defence ministers in Budapest.The current Hungarian presidency of the European Union, which began on July 1, has been controversial from the beginning. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's unannounced visit to Russian President Vladimir Putin has caused further outrage within the European Union.The EU reacts: Despite disagreements within the bloc, the EU's chief diplomat, Josep Borrell, has announced a boycott of an informal meeting of foreign and defence ministers planned by Hungary in Budapest at the end of August. Speaking in Brussels on Monday, Borrell said he will instead invite them to a meeting in Brussels after the summer break. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also announced a boycott, ordering top EU officials to skip a series of meetings in Hungary. She announced that no commissioners, but only senior officials, would attend future informal ministerial meetings in Hungary under the current EU presidency.OrbÃ¡n's â€˜peace missionâ€™Von der Leyen and Borrell's controversial decisions followed OrbÃ¡n's visits, a few days into Hungary's EU presidency, which were not coordinated with the EU. OrbÃ¡n met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev, followed by Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, staging it as a 'peace mission' to resolve the war between the two countries. He later travelled to Beijing for talks with China's leader Xi Jinping and to the United States for a meeting with former US president and current Republican candidate Donald Trump.The visits were met with great displeasure in the EU, mainly because the Kremlin was able to use the Moscow visit for propaganda purposes, using the visit as proof of some improvement in relations between Russia and the EU. Additionally, OrbÃ¡n did not make the EU's position on the war in Ukraine clear during the trip.The European Commission made it clear on several occasions that OrbÃ¡n was not travelling on behalf of the bloc.EU member states not aligned in their responseThe issue of a political boycott of the Hungarian EU presidency dominated a meeting of EU Foreign Ministers in Brussels on Monday. At the meeting, a number of participants spoke out against a proposal by EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, to respond by boycotting a meeting in Budapest.Luxembourg's Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel was the most outspoken critic of the boycott plans on Monday. He spoke of the plans being nonsense and urged politicians to travel to Budapest to make their views clear to the Hungarian government. Countries such as Spain and Slovenia have also expressed clear opposition to Borrell's initiative.Slovenian Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon announced on Monday that Slovenian ministers intend to participate in informal meetings organised by the Hungarian EU presidency in Budapest.Fajon added that this will be the case unless there is a different collective decision at the EU level. Regarding OrbÃ¡n's ""peace mission"", Fajon stressed that even if it was well-intentioned, the Hungarian prime minister certainly did not have an EU mandate.""We wish for negotiations to begin and the war to end as soon as possible, under Ukraine's terms. But we are not yet at that point today. We support and will continue to strive for any plan based on the UN Charter and international law,"" Fajon stressed.Bulgarian MEP Eva Maydell said: â€œWe have seen in recent weeks that OrbÃ¡n visited Russia, but he also visited Ukraine. We have seen that in recent years [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has been trying to make sure that Europe is not unitedâ€œ. All of these actions by Putin, which he thought would divide us, are uniting us and bringing us closer - she added.Behind the scenes, according to diplomats, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and representatives of countries such as France and Italy expressed similar views. On the other side, however, were countries from north-eastern Europe such as Poland. Lithuania and Sweden had already announced days ago that they would temporarily not send ministers to Hungary for meetings in response to OrbÃ¡n's unilateral action.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg is sticking to his previous position of opposing a boycott of the Hungarian EU presidency in protest against the solo actions of Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, a spokeswoman told the Austrian press agency APA.Portugal's Foreign Minister Paulo Rangel rejected the idea of a political boycott of the Hungarian presidency of the Council of the EU but acknowledged the â€˜political significanceâ€™ of Portuguese ministers' absence from meetings in Budapest.â€˜What I'm about to say is subject to permanent review. We [Portugal] will have political representation [at the informal meetings], but not at the ministerial level [...]. It has a political meaning, but there is no political boycott here,â€™ said Rangel on the matter.Hungarian presidency fends off criticismHungary's European Affairs Minister JÃ¡nos BÃ³ka hit back at the boycott decision, saying the Commission could not ""cherry pick"" which EU member states it wanted to work with.""Are all commission decisions now based on political considerations?"" he wrote on X. ""There was a hysterical and coordinated attack against Hungarian peace policies that completely ignore the facts,"" said Hungarian Foreign Minister PÃ©ter SzijjÃ¡rtÃ³ in response to EU reactions.Hungarian government spokesman ZoltÃ¡n KovÃ¡cs said Hungary faces ""aggressive, war-mongering hysteria over its 'peace mission'"" and the debate over whether to oppose the informal meeting in Budapest ""childish"".KovÃ¡cs noted that Hungary is ""prepared"" to hold the meeting in its country, ""but is also willing to attend if it is held in Brussels,"" he wrote in a message on his official X account.The meeting of EU foreign and defence ministers' is currently scheduled for 28-29 August in Budapest. The meeting will cover a range of topics, including the war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, Syria and the Cyprus issue.This article is published twice a week.

Moscow renames square as anger over EU support for Ukraine boils,"Russia has changed the name of its Europe Square to Eurasia Square in satisfaction with Europe's position on the war in Ukraine and its support for the country. Ukraine is also currently in membership talks with the European Union.Moscow (dpa) – The Russian capital Moscow changed the name of its Europe Square on Wednesday out of apparent anger at the European Union's support for Ukraine.The mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobyanin, issued a decree renaming the site in the city centre Eurasia Square, referring to the entire landmasses of Europe and Asia.No reason was given for the decision, but it is seen as another sign of Russia's turning away from Europe as a result of Moscow's war of aggression against Ukraine, and its increasing focus on Asia.Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has provided financial and political support to the country. Ukraine is also currently in accession talks with the bloc. It was granted EU candidate status in June 2022.Moscow says the EU is pursuing an aggressive and anti-Russian policy, an accusation repeated by Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova to journalists on Wednesday.Europe Square was opened more than 20 years ago as a Russian-Belgian project, and was intended to symbolise the ""unity of the European states."" For a long time, the flags of European countries flew on a large monument in the square, but they were taken down last year. (24 July)",1
"The EU better prepared to uphold the rule of law, but Hungary falling behindÂ ","The European Commission on Wednesday published its fifth annual report on the development of rule of law across the bloc â€“ including, for the first time, four enlargement candidate countries.Stronger rule of law and better preparedness to tackle challenges is the verdict of the European Commissionâ€™s 2024 Rule of Law report published on Wednesday which evaluates the rule of law developments in the 27 member states of the European Union. â€œMember States and the EU as a whole are much better prepared to detect, prevent and address emerging challenges,â€ according to a European Commission press release. The overall rule-of-law report found that 68 percent of changes the Commission had recommended in last yearâ€™s document had been fully or partially addressed across all the countries scrutinised. However, in some countries – prominently in Hungary – issues remain or have deteriorated. Media freedom is still at risk in several EU countries, the European Commission said.â€œThis yearâ€™s report shows that Member States have improved and strengthened the rule of law not least by implementing the Commissionâ€™s recommendations. Unfortunately, concerns remain in several Member States in different categories,â€ said VÄ›ra JourovÃ¡, European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency who presented the report on Wednesday together with her colleague EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders.The report is published annually since 2020 and is a check-up of the European Unionâ€™s standards of government, corruption safeguards, and civil society conditions and the state of media freedom. It plays a preventive role, designed to help in the early detection and prevention of issues in the rule of law area by evaluating the situation for the EU as a whole as well as its member states. The report also issues recommendations which are non-binding. For the first time, EU accession candidates Albania, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia are included in the report. Particularly damning marks for Hungary Hungary falls well short of EU democratic standards, notably on corruption, bribery, political funding, conflicts of interest and lack of media independence, according to a European Commission evaluation published on Wednesday, underlining a growing rift between Brussels and Budapest.â€œHungary is a real systemic issue for the commission about the rule of law,â€ Didier Reynders told a news conference, presenting the report. The country made minimal to no progress on rule of law breaches identified in the last annual EU report, and the Commission has lengthened its total recommended remedies for Hungary to pursue to eight – one more than last year.â€œI think thatâ€™s an absolute record for the rule of law report,â€ one EU official said on condition of not being identified.Hungary, currently holding the EU presidency, has angered its EU partners on a range of issues including perceived democratic backsliding in many domestic areas, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡nâ€™s rogue diplomacy in Moscow and stalling aid for Ukraine. In Hungary, media pluralism and freedom were said to be under threat, with the composition of the media regulator and the lack of transparency on state advertising and media ownership all posing problems. Hungarian public-sector corruption â€œremains highâ€ in the view of experts and businesses, with high-level corruption in particular not being identified by prosecutors, the report said. Transparency shortcomings on political party and campaign funding â€œremain unaddressedâ€, the report further said.The eight reforms the Commission urged Hungary to undertake also include improvements to its justice system, boosting oversight of lobbying and the independence of the media regulator, as well as removing obstacles encountered by civil society organisations. The report is particularly problematic for the government of right-wing populist OrbÃ¡n because billions in EU funding have been frozen due to deficits in the rule of law. Last year, only a partial sum was released following a number of judicial reforms.Media freedom across the bloc has to be protected from creeping threatsWorking conditions for journalists and â€œthe lack of independence of public service media governance in several countries remain issues of concernâ€, the Commission said.In Slovakia, the dissolution of the public broadcaster Radio and Television of Slovakia (RTVS) in July to set up a new media organisation (Slovak Television and Radio, STVR) caused concern about the future independence of the new entity.While the country has made some progress improving journalistsâ€™ safety, the Commission sees further need for progress – also in regard to the editorial independence of public media and the strengthening of independent management. In Italy, the independence of the public service broadcaster RAI â€œrepresents a long-standing source of concernâ€ over governance and funding issues. Comprehensive reform is needed â€œto ensure that RAI is better shielded from risks of political interferenceâ€, the Commission said, referencing contributions from media organisations in Italy.There was also no progress in transparency surrounding media ownership, the Commission said, while underlining that the countryâ€™s defamation regime has also not improved. Death threats, physical attacks and intimidation towards journalists â€œcontinue to raise concerns on the safety of journalists in Italyâ€, the Commission said. It called on the government to continue the process of reform the law on defamation, which is a criminal offence in Italy, with the abolishment of the penalty of imprisonment for press defamation. Issues of editorial independence in public broadcasters in Romania and Malta have also not been resolved, the Commission said. Concerns regarding the transparency of media ownership in Bulgaria persist. For Croatia, a lack of progress concerning the transparency of state advertisement in the media has been identified in the Commissionâ€™s report. In neighbouring Slovenia, some progress in the protection of journalists in the country since the last report was made but certain safeguards are expected to be introduced in the new media legislation which is currently being prepared, the report mentions.The Commission said, that â€œwhile the new governance model contributed to improving the independence of RTV Slovenija, the public service broadcaster is facing a financial crisis and changes to its funding are needed to guarantee appropriate resourcesâ€.Regarding the Dutch media landscape, the European Commission states that the Netherlands must continue to support the quality of public broadcasting and also strengthen the conditions for public media â€œto uphold journalistic standardsâ€. Ongoing attempts to reform public broadcasting are a source of worry, in addition to the trend of newspapers, magazines and broadcasters gradually becoming part of an increasingly smaller number of media companies. While people in Germany are well protected against the arbitrary exercise of power by the government, the report calls for progress to be made regarding a plan for the pressâ€™ right to information vis-Ã -vis federal authorities.To shore up media freedom across the bloc from creeping threats, the EU passed the European Media Freedom Act, set to enter into force on August 8, 2025, which established EU-wide legal safeguards for editorial independence and the protection of journalistic sources.Progress in fighting corruption and strengthening the judiciary but more needs to be doneThe Spanish government considers that the Rule of Law report recognises progress in Spain after the approval of the amnesty law and the agreement to renew the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ), as â€œa great successâ€.The report also showed â€œconcernâ€ in regards to the actions of some regional governments such as the Balearic Islands for closing their anti-corruption office, or Valencia for reducing the budget of its anti-fraud office.The Rule of Law report also looked at the level of perceived judicial independence. Some countries – Austria, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg and Sweden – ranked very high with scores above 75 percent. Poland, Bulgaria and Croatia scored low marks, below 30 percent. Poland, however, stood out in a positive light than before as the European Commission announced in May this year that the â€œconditions for maintaining the [Article 7] procedure no longer existedâ€.Croatia made some progress in the fight against corruption and significant progress in terms of the level of remuneration of judges and prosecutors.For Germany, the Commission sees the current remuneration of judges and public prosecutors as a risk and recommends measures to ensure an appropriate level of remuneration. The report recommends extending the period during which federal ministers and parliamentary state secretaries are not allowed to work in the lobby departments of companies or organisations after leaving office.While Portugal has made some progress in adapting human resources to the judicial system, the Commission recommended an increase in the number of judicial staff – particularly court clerks – in order to improve effectiveness of procedures especially in the fight against corruption. The Netherlands, too, received recommendations to tackle the workload and staff shortages in the judicial services. For Bulgaria, the report acknowledged the start of revising the existing anti-corruption strategy and positive steps to improve access to information held by public authorities. The Commission also pointed out that a comprehensive constitutional reform was adopted last year to improve juridical independence, addressing long-standing concerns. However, while rules for law-making improved, issues with implementation and concerns about the quality of the legislative process remain.Enlargement Countries included for the first time For the first time, the European Commission also looked at the rule of law developments in some of the â€œmost advancedâ€ enlargement candidate countries though not issuing recommendations as they will be formulated in the Enlargement Report. The EU executive believes that this may aid the countriesâ€™ reform efforts and thus supports their progress on their European path.For Serbia, the report mentioned the substantial reforms the country has undergone in recent years, pointing out the constitutional reform underway aiming to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. At the same time, among other things, the report states that the political pressure on the judiciary and the prosecutorâ€™s office is still high and there are shortcomings regarding the financing of political parties. This article is published twice a week.

EUÂ rebukes seven member states over excessive deficits,"After the European Commission recommended to begin procedures concerning government deficits that are too large, the Council of the European Union on Friday gave the green light. Brussels (dpa) - EUÂ member states on Friday endorsed findings that seven of the 27 member states have excessive budget deficits, kick-starting a formal procedure intended to reduce borrowing.The member states green-lit a European Commission recommendation to begin procedures concerning government deficits that are too large - and thus take on too much new debt - in Belgium, France, Italy, Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia.The purpose of excessive deficit procedures is to get member states to get a grip on their budgets. In theory, the procedures can lead to costly penalties, but this has never actually happened.The member states also agreed to keep open an existing procedure against Romania.The opening of the procedures means that towards the end of the year, EU member states will be asked to approve recommendations from the commission on how to address the deficits in a given time frame, an EU press release said.Ministers representing their countries in the Council of the European Union took separate decisions for each of the seven member states individually.The decisions were made via a written procedure among the national capitals - not an in-person council meeting - and the seven countries concerned were not allowed to participate in the decisions on their own cases.The international treaties underpinning the European Union state that member countries should now allow their budget deficits to exceed 3% of their gross domestic product (GDP). Sovereign debt - which accumulates when governments run budget deficits - should not exceed 60% of GDP.Of the seven countries concerned, Italy had the largest budget deficit in 2023, with 7.4% of GDP, according to the EU's statement. Hungary had a budget deficit of 6.7%, Romania 6.6%, France 5.5%, Poland 5.1%, Malta and Slovakia 4.9%, and Belgium 4.4%. (July 26)",1
"Earth experiences warmest day in recent history, EU climate change service says","With the hottest temperatures on record month after month as well as more extreme weather events such as heatwaves, floods, landslides and drought, the effects of global warming are showing. What is the current situation across Europe and how does the EU plan to deal with it?Â July 22, 2024, was – to date – the warmest day in recent history on Earth, according to data by the European Unionâ€™s Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). According to C3S, Europe has been warming much faster than the global average over the last few decades, more or less twice as fast.This is due to a combination of different factors, said C3Sâ€™s director Carlo Buontempo in an interview with Slovenian news agency STA on Monday. One of them is that the Arctic, part of which is included in a definition of Europe, is probably one of the fastest warming regions in the world. Among other reasons is the loss of ice and snow in the mountains as well as on the plain of Central Europe.Heatwaves in Europe are already more frequent, more intense and will last longer. â€œSo this is something we need to get used to,â€ said Buontempo.Â EU civil protection mechanism gears up for summerThe European Commission is expecting another atypical summer in the European Union with extreme weather phenomena, the European Commissioner for Crisis Management, Janez LenarÄiÄ, told Portuguese news agency Lusa in mid-July.At a time when southern Europe is facing high temperatures and central and northern Europe is confronted with consecutive days of rain, the Slovenian Commissioner said that the Civil Protection services are prepared through the disaster response mechanism.While civil protection is a national competence, national authorities can request support through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism in case of emergencies. All 27 EU member states – and ten non-members – partake in the mechanism created in 2001. The EUâ€™s Emergency Response Coordination Centre helps dealing with assistance requests. For this summer, the EU has set up a special fleet of 28 firefighting planes and four helicopters in ten member states. The European Commission has also earmarked 600 million Euro of EU funds to facilitate the acquisition of twelve more aircraft, which will be shared between six countries in the bloc.Extreme weather events in Europe intensifyAcross the continent, heatwaves and subsequent fires are endangering people, their livelihoods, animals and crops, oftentimes leaving a trail of damage worth millions of Euro while also impacting peopleâ€™s daily routines.At the end of July, all Spanish regions, except the Canary Islands, were on â€œorange alertâ€ – which indicates a â€œsignificant riskâ€ on the maximum warning level scale – due to high temperatures or storms with warnings that maximum temperatures will reach 39-40 degrees, according to the Spanish meteorological agency Aemet.On Monday, the thermometer in the south of France went into overdrive as a result of a heat wave. French weather service MÃ©tÃ©o-France stated that in large parts of southern France â€œthe heat is set to intensify considerably,â€ and the 40-degree mark could be exceeded in some regions.Â Paris is currently hosting the Olympic Games with venues spread across the country. On Monday, the Paris Region announced the activation of the heatwave plan in the ÃŽle-de-France region, where â€œair quality will be poorâ€ according to the Airparif observatory. The regional plan includes the distribution of more than 2.5 million water bottles on public transport and â€œalmost 200,000 hats, fans and water bottlesâ€ to Olympic spectators.While northern Italy has been hit with storms and torrential rain causing floods and landslides in recent weeks, the southern part is facing a major drought. Deputy Premier and Transport and Infrastructure Minister Matteo Salvini called the severe drought in Sicily a â€œnational emergencyâ€.Last week, the National Association of the Agricultural Water Board (ANBI) warned that in three weeksâ€™ time â€œthere will be no water for agricultureâ€ in central and southern Italy.Â Protests are growing in Sicily over poor water supply. The drought has led to a 60 percent decrease of water reservoirs, leading local authorities to ration water in Sicilyâ€™s main city Palermo as well as in 50 other municipalities.Slovenia was hit by major floods last year causing billions of Euro in damage and is still dealing with reconstruction work. This summer again, heavy rain caused some floods and landslides in the most affected regions. Lack of rainfall however caused a forest fire in the southwestern Kras region in mid-July, the same area that was hit by the most devastating blazes in Sloveniaâ€™s history already in 2022.Â In Bulgaria, recent weeks of heat also led to fires: Since July 12, more than 1,430 people and about 280 units of military equipment participated in extinguishing fires across the country. On July 16, Bulgaria sought support through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and help from Spain, France and Czechia arrived.The government is working on compensation schemes for affected individuals and farmers who lost their crops, and is planning to amend the public procurement act to facilitate easier purchase of specialised equipment needed for disaster management. On July 17, North Macedonia requested urgent help combating severe wildfires through the EUâ€™s Civil Protection Mechanism – help came from Serbia, Slovenia, TÃ¼rkiye, Croatia and Romania. Between January and June, the country faced 73 wildfires. In 2023, North Macedonia counted 170 forest fires according to Kire Mihailov, deputy head of the National Forests public enterprise.Â In July, neighbouring Albania experienced a heatwave and battled wildfires in the south of the country – also receiving aid from Greece under the EUâ€™s civil rescue mechanism. The heat also led to measures to distribute drinking water in cultural and historical heritage sites.Â Greece itself is also currently facing fires. Its second-largest island Evia has been battling a wildfire since Monday with hundreds of firefighters on location.â€œWe still have a very difficult month ahead of us, the month of August, and obviously we all need to be absolutely alert,â€ Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told ministers prior to a meeting on Tuesday.Climate change: A cause for premature deaths, not adapting â€œviolation of human rightsâ€The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that if measures against climate change are not taken, four of its greatest effects – extreme weather events, poor air quality, food insecurity and infectious diseases – will worsen, causing an additional 250,000 premature deaths per year between 2030 and 2050.Heat waves are the deadliest meteorological phenomenon associated with climate changes causing 489,000 deaths per year, estimates the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), but the actual mortality related to extreme weather events could be 30 times higher as many countries lack reliable data, the WMO fears.Â The International Labour Organization (ILO) said on July 25Â  that climate change is making work more difficult and dangerous for billions of people. While in Europe and Central Asia the proportion of people exposed to excessive heat at work is low by global standards, it has increased more than in any other region of the world over the past 20 years, the ILO said further.In a report released by Oxfam France earlier in July, the non-governmental organisation denounced that at least 26 of the 50 fundamental rights, such as health, access to education or decent housing, are threatened in France by the â€œnegligence of the Stateâ€ in adapting to climate change.Â FACT CHECKFact check on weather extremes: Both historic hot days and climate change existOn social networks, users shared an old picture together with weather data for the year 1921. According to the post, there had already been maximum temperatures of up to 39.4 degrees Celsius 100 years ago. A comment stated that this is despite the fact that â€œthere was no myth of man-made climate changeâ€ back then.The fact-checking team by German Press Agency dpa explains that the weather data and the picture itself are correct but that – in connection with the accusation – the difference between weather and climate must be emphasised. Weather refers to short-term events in a specific place at a specific time, while climate encompasses long-term weather patterns over a longer period and a larger area. It is also said that humans are bearing a part responsibility for climate change too. Read the full fact check in German: https://dpa-factchecking.com/germany/240626-99-537375/Â This article is published twice a week.

""Very few national court proceedings lead to convictions.""Border protection is a fraught topic in the EU. Governments – particularly on the union's eastern and southern frontiers – are under intense public pressure to reduce irregular migration and to stop unauthorised crossings at land and sea borders. But some campaign groups point to the hardships irregular migrants face and argue for them to be taken in.The FRA report cites allegations of ""physical violence, ill-treatment, failure to rescue people in distress, stripping people of their clothing, stealing and/or destroying their property, forced separation of families and summary expulsion of those seeking asylum.""For instance, the report states that in 2022, Greek police on the island of Kos allegedly subjected two Palestinians to physical and sexual abuse before abandoning them on a life raft at sea, after which the pair were rescued by Turkish coastguards.According to the FRA, victims are taking their cases to the Strasbourg-based European Court of Human Rights – which is not affiliated to the EU – because of the rarity of convictions in national courts.The agency calls for national authorities to conduct ""prompt and effective investigations,"" to provide adequate evidence and to involve victims in those investigations.

New Hungarian visa rule stirs Russian spy concerns in EU,"European Peopleâ€™s Party leader Manred Weber has criticised a new Hungarian visa liberalisation measure for workers from Russia and Belarus. The German conservative is worried that the move endangers EU security and provides a loophole for espionage.Brussels (dpa) – The European Union is worried that a new Hungarian visa rule for foreign workers from Russia and Belarus could endanger EU security, after a leading conservative politician warned the trade bloc about the rule.European People's Party's (EPP) Chairman Manfred Weber from Germany warned European Council President Charles Michel in a letter that the visa liberalisation move could pose a ""serious risk"" to EU security.Hungary has previously operated a special visa regime for foreign workers from Ukraine and Serbia. Budapest expanded the rules in July to eight countries, including visitors from Russia and Belarus.According to the visa regulations, foreign workers may stay for two years and then have their stay extended for three years at a time – for as often as they wish.Foreign workers may also work in any profession. However, in order to benefit from the regulation, they must prove that they have a job, accommodation and health insurance in Hungary.""Such a policy could create grave loopholes for espionage activities, and potentially allow large numbers of Russians to enter Hungary with minimal supervision,"" Weber wrote in a letter. He called for EU leaders to address the Hungarian visa rules at the next summit in October.Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n's government is viewed as close to Russia by other EU member states. OrbÃ¡n came under fierce criticism from other EU countries for recent visits to Kiev, Moscow and Beijing on a self-proclaimed ""peace mission"" to end the Ukraine war. (30 July)",1
European day of remembrance commemorates 1944 genocide of Sinti and Roma,"Today marks the European Holocaust Memorial Day for Sinti and Roma, commemorating the genocide of these ethnic minority groups during the Second World War. Even today, survivors and other members of the communities continue to face persistent discrimination and difficulties  integrating into society.Friday, August 2 marks the European Holocaust Memorial Day for Sinti and Roma, commemorating the genocide of the ethnic minority Sinti and Roma people in the former Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz-Birkenau during the Second World War.On August 2, 1944, the last 4,300 Sinti and Roma at Auschwitz were murdered – despite a fierce revolt within the camp. The day of commemoration is dedicated to an estimated 250,000 to 500,000 Sinti and Roma who were murdered in Nazi-occupied Europe. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the genocide. The day has been a European day of remembrance since 2015. In April that year, the European Parliament passed a resolution to formally recognise it as such.The Roma are Europeâ€™s largest ethnic minority, with an estimated total of ten to twelve million living in Europe – some six million of them in the European Union, according to Council of Europe data. As some Roma are traditionally nomadic, exact figures are unknown.In EU terminology, Roma is an umbrella-term for ethnic minorities including Roma, Sinti and others, as well as â€œtravellerâ€ populations such as Gypsies. EU countries with a large share of Roma people include Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, Spain, Slovakia and France. While the commemoration of the genocide shows a symbolic recognition for Nazi victims, 80 years later persistent discrimination against the Roma and Sinti communities remains. The genocide is a source for trauma within the community which is still politically, socially and economically marginalised. Persons responsible for or involved have prevented it from being recognised for decades after the genocide.â€œThe history of the Gypsy people, both in Spain and in the rest of Europe, is a history of persecution, denial, and oblivion,â€ said JosÃ© Vega from the Spanish Federation of Gypsy Womenâ€™s Associations (Fakali).Troubled waters for Sinti and Roma across EuropeAccording to a survey conducted by the Vienna-based EU Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) – which was carried out in 2021 in eight EU member states and two non-EU members – 80 percent of Roma are at risk of poverty, 52 percent suffer housing deprivation and 22 percent live in homes without running water.In April 2024, the European Commission asked EU countries to â€œredouble their effortsâ€ to combat the high levels of anti-gypsyism and discrimination suffered by the Roma population in Europe, and to guarantee their equal access to education, employment and health care.In Spain, the government estimates there may be around 750,000 Roma in the country currently, according to sources from the Ministry of Social Rights. A majority is concentrated in Andalusia, the Valencian Community, Catalonia and the Community of Madrid.In recent years there have been significant improvements for the Roma population, such as the law on equal treatment and non-discrimination and the reform of the Penal Code with the inclusion of anti-gypsyism as a hate crime – but access to housing and education remain among the great challenges.In North Macedonia, Roma people are included in the constitution as one of the ethnic communities living in the country. There are several Roma parties and they have been included in all compositions of the multi-party parliament since 1990, with several past governments having Roma ministers.However, Roma majority neighbourhoods in the country are located on the periphery of cities, are often poorly urbanised lacking the most basic urban needs, and have to endure substandard conditions. According to research by the United Nations International Childrenâ€™s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) and the World Bank, around 30 percent of the Roma population in North Macedonia lives in prefabricated buildings, and most Roma neighbourhoods have unpaved streets, no street lighting, and no kindergartens, schools, or medical clinics.A UN report assessed that in North Macedonia, existing laws for the protection of human rights and against discrimination are not effective. Cases of young Roma people not being allowed into cafÃ©s, clubs and pools, experiencing harassment from police officers, as well as discriminatory treatment in courts are highlighted as examples of direct and indirect cases of discrimination.For neighbouring Serbia, the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) said in June that the country must do more to tackle discrimination of the Roma and LGTBQ communities and counter hate speech. ""Hate speech against Roma and other ethnic minorities, LGBTI communities and refugees/migrants is persisting in political and other public discourse,"" added the Council of Europe mandated body, using an alternative acronym to describe the queer community.In Austria, Roma live mainly in the eastern state of the Burgenland, but also in larger cities such as Vienna and Graz. People across Austria still express racist prejudices or believe that they themselves are to blame for attacks and violence against them. According to Austrian historian Stefan Benedik, there is also racism that refers to the Nazi era, with graffiti all over Austria bearing slogans such as â€œRoma to the concentration campâ€.In Slovenia, Roma people live in larger communities mainly in the eastern and south-eastern parts of the country. They have a special status under the countryâ€™s constitution and enjoy special rights that allow them to preserve and develop their culture, language and heritage. They have representatives on local councils in the communities they live in. A specific law on the Roma community was adopted in 2007, and there is a national programme of measures to benefit the Roma, which relies heavily on EU funding. However, poor socio-economic status and housing conditions, low participation in education, unemployment, the isolation of some Roma communities and the persistent prejudice of the majority population against Roma continue to hinder their integration. Local authorities in the southeast of Slovenia believe that the state is doing too little to curb the violence and crime caused by some Roma.In Bulgaria, on May 30 the National Council for Cooperation on Ethnic and Integration Issues with the Council of Ministers approved a monitoring report on the implementation of Bulgariaâ€™s National Strategy for Roma Equality, Inclusion and Participation for 2021 to 2030. One step towards a successful Roma inclusion and integration, taken in 2023, was the regulatory setting of targeted funding for the appointment of educational mediators, social workers and assistant teachers, the report said. However, Amnesty International had published its annual State of the Worldâ€™s Human Rights report the month before, which criticised Bulgaria for racial discrimination in denying Roma access to public swimming pools.A view of a mobile phone with the various social media apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. Photo: Yui Mok/Press Association/dpa(Social) media fuels hate speech, disinformation In some countries, such as Italy and Bulgaria, the media reinforce harmful attitudes and prejudices towards Roma, despite the existence of laws and codes of ethics that prohibit hate speech and discrimination. These are the findings of a study funded by the Council of Europe and the European Union in June. In Italy, the media often selectively represent â€œRoma as subjects or objects in reports of minor crimes, domestic violence and social disputes involving Roma communities near local neighbourhoodsâ€, the study says. â€œSuch portrayals contribute to negative stereotypes, presenting Roma as â€˜clanâ€™ people who are irresponsible, particularly regarding childcare and the treatment of women within their families.â€In July, the Bulgarian NGO Amalipe Centre for Interethnic Dialogue and Tolerance released a report, according to which false information about healthcare and politics influenced the Roma community in the country. The analysis conducted between February and May 2024 revealed that social media is actively used to target the community with anti-vaccination and anti-Semitic propaganda.New Holocaust research consortium in the worksIf approved by the European Commission, the Netherlands will become the host of an international Holocaust research agency. The idea is that participating countries in the consortium – the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Israel, Croatia, Austria, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom – pool information, including photos, videos, paper and digital archives.Although there is a lot of information on the Holocaust, it is currently â€œscattered among thousands of archives, libraries, museums and other institutionsâ€. This fragmentation, – according to the Dutch Minister of Education, Culture and Science, Eppo Bruins, and Vincent Karremans, who is the state secretary responsible for war remembrance – makes it difficult for researchers to find all the necessary information. This is what the research office should try to solve.This article is published twice a week. The content is based on news by agencies participating in the enr.",1
"EU sends €4.2 billion in financial aid to Ukraine
","The payment shall help financing the functioning of the state and support economic stability in Ukraine which is fighting Russia's all-out invasion. Brussels - European Union countries signed off on the first quarterly payment to Ukraine from a â‚¬50 billion support fund on Tuesday.The payment worth â‚¬4.2 billion is to finance the functioning of the state as Ukraine fights to defeat Russia's all-out invasion and support the economic stability of the war-stricken country.The EUÂ overcame entrenched opposition from Hungarian PrimeÂ Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n earlier this year to set up the â‚¬50-billion fund for Ukraine, sourced from the bloc's budget, to run until 2027.The Hungarian premier, viewed as having the closest relations with Moscow in the bloc, vetoed a previous attempt to set up the fund citing a lack of built-in review mechanisms.OrbÃ¡n has also previously linked the EU budget negotiations with the disbursement of EU funds for his country, which had been frozen over corruption and abuse of power allegations.Ukraine must meet pre-agreed conditions EU leaders agreed to debate the fund's operation each year until 2027.With the latest â‚¬4.2 billion payment, the EU has issued â‚¬12 billion to Ukraine from the support fund.Ukraine must meet pre-agreed conditions to continue to receive the regular quarterly payments under the fund.

From medical advancements to decarbonising steel: A look at nuclear technology in the EU,"Nuclear energy is triggering many debates â€“ also among member states of the European Union. Still, the bloc is looking at nuclear technology, partly in a bid to achieve its climate goals. Dutch innovation aims at reusing nuclear waste and a Franco-Italian cooperation wants to speed up the decarbonisation of the emission-heavy steel industry.â€œNuclear technologies can play an important role in clean energy transitions,â€ said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the first-ever Nuclear Energy Summit in March. The summit had been set up by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Belgium.The German conservative pointed out that she was aware that â€œthere are different viewsâ€ in the EU on nuclear power. She added that â€œmany countries are giving a fresh look to the potential role that nuclear might playâ€ in the wake of â€œthe global energy crisis caused by Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraineâ€. It could contribute to climate goals, energy security and stabilising energy prices, according to von der Leyen.The projections of the International Energy Agency and the European Commission for 2050 show that nuclear power will grow and function as a complement to renewables which â€œwill be the backbone of EU power production by 2050â€, she said.However, this energy source has declined both in the EU and in the world: Across the planet it has gone from 18 percent of the electricity â€œmixâ€ in 1988 to nine percent today. In the EU, its use is currently around 22 percent when in the 1990s it still generated a third of Europeâ€™s electricity.Von der Leyen positioned herself in favour of extending the life of the nuclear plants in use â€œprovided of course their safe operationâ€, as it is â€œone of the cheapest ways to secure clean power at scaleâ€.Â The European Council included nuclear energy among the strategic technologies for climate neutrality and as a way to accelerate the reduction of emissions it was incorporated in the conclusions document of the last Climate Summit (COP28) – a historic first.Nuclear energy has been gaining space in the financial treatment it receives in the EU, but it still does not enjoy the same sympathies as renewables.(Some) EU member states demand more money for nuclear energyIn March, the twelve EU member states grouped in the European Nuclear Alliance demanded more financing for nuclear energy and asked that financial institutions treat it the same as renewable energy.""All net-zero technologies including nuclear energy and value chain should be leveraged, possibilities and benefits of financing instruments such as support of the EIB [European Investment Bank] and Innovation Fund will be explored to that end,â€ said the alliance's statement after the first Nuclear Energy Summit.Bulgaria, Croatia, Finland, France, Hungary, Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Czech Republic and Sweden commit to â€œdeveloping access to private and public financing, and exploring the possibilities and benefits of European financing instrumentsâ€.They point out as a specific objective â€œto support large-scale reactors, SMR technologies and [the] associated European value chainâ€ with atomic energy, which requires enriched fuel and radioactive waste management systems, among others.The alliance launched in 2023 to support a source for generating energy that EU member states Germany, Luxembourg, Spain or Denmark are not in favour of.In Germany, the last three nuclear power plants went offline in April 2023 Â­– but the calls for a return to nuclear energy are growing louder.In December 2023, the Spanish government approved the 7th General Radioactive Waste Plan which establishes the governmentâ€™s policy on the management of radioactive waste, including spent nuclear fuel, and the dismantling and decommissioning of nuclear facilities. It also established a timetable for the closure of nuclear power plants between 2027 and 2035.However, there are also opponents to the closure, for example the president of Foro Nuclear, Ignacio Araluce. He said that the plants â€œare necessary for the systemâ€ and that Spain â€œis being left aloneâ€ in his idea of closing nuclear power plants.EU support for the production of mini reactorsÂ The European Commission actively supports the development of small modular reactors, within a technological race in which the EU lags behind China, the United States and Russia.The European Industrial Alliance on SMR was launched last February by the European Commission together with the recommendation on the intermediate climate target for 2040, underlining the potential of atomic energy among the low-carbon technologies that can help the EU cut emissions. The initiative brings together governments, industry players and stakeholders seeking to accelerate the development of the sector.Small modular reactors are nuclear reactors that are smaller in both power and physical size compared to traditional gigawatt-scale power plants. Dutch innovation plans to reuse nuclear wasteDutch start-up Thorizon will receive a ten million Euro grant from the French government. With this, the Amsterdam-based company wants to accelerate the development of a small nuclear reactor that uses nuclear waste from regular power plants as fuel. According to the company, one such plant could provide clean energy to 250,000 households.The new nuclear reactor should become more sustainable, cheaper and safer than conventional nuclear reactors. â€œOur design is unique in using replaceable cartridges in the reactor core. This allows us to work with materials that do not need to withstand reactor conditions for 50 or 100 years,â€ explained Thorizonâ€™s CEO Kiki Lauwers.Franco-Italian nuclear cooperation to combat steel industry emissionsIn July, French electricity group EDF announced that it had signed a nuclear cooperation agreement in Italy with the federation of steel industries to speed up the decarbonisation of the sector in a country that has been nuclear-free for almost 35 years.The agreement aims at â€œpromoting cooperation in the use of nuclear energy to boost the competitiveness and decarbonisation of the Italian steel industryâ€, EDF said in a press release. The steel industry is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. The memorandum of understanding was signed with Italian energy company Edison, Italian power plant manufacturer Ansaldo Energia, nuclear technology developer Ansaldo Nucleare and Federacciai, the Italian steel industry federation.It â€œmarks further progress in setting an agenda for developing new nuclear energy in Italyâ€, said Nicola Monti, Edisonâ€™s CEO, quoted in the press release.Italy has not produced nuclear energy since the 1990s, following the countryâ€™s decision in a referendum to withdraw from civil nuclear power in 1987 after the Chernobyl accident.Nuclear reactor for medical purposesIn late July, the European Commission agreed to a two billion Euro Dutch subsidy for the construction of a new nuclear reactor in the Dutch village of Petten. The reactor – which doesnâ€™t generate electricity – is intended, among other things, to develop and store medical radioisotopes for cancer treatment for the medical PALLAS project.Mandatory under European competition agreements, the Netherlands had requested permission from Brussels for the grant for construction. According to European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, the application was approved because the PALLAS project contributes to securing essential medicines for the European market. The project can also provide â€œa breakthrough innovationâ€ in nuclear technology that benefits European citizens.This article is published twice a week.

"New EUÂ emissions rules for industry, farmers enter into force","On Sunday, new regulations came into force aiming at reducing emissions from farms and industry. However, the requirements do not apply immediately. Brussels - New EUÂ rules aimed at reducing emissions from farms and large industrial plants came into force on Sunday, according to the European Commission, giving member states two years to update their national laws.The law - which includes metal mining plants and battery manufacturers, as well as pig and poultry farms - is expected to reduce key air pollutants such as particulate matter, sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxide by up to 40% by 2050.Operations such as particularly large pig and poultry farms were already subject to the regulations, but the existing rules will be extended, according to the European Union's executive.Delayed applicationHowever, the requirements do not apply immediately. Industrial companies will have four years from 2028 to apply the latest available technologies, the commission said. For farmers, the rules will apply from 2030.Violations can result in fines of at least 3% of annual turnover in the worst case, according to the commission. Authorities will also be given more power to temporarily shut down plants that do not comply with the regulations.Proposal watered downThe commission had originally pushed for stricter rules, given that power generation, waste incineration and intensive livestock farming are responsible for harmful substances in the air, water and soil.Pollution caused by substances such as nitrogen oxide, particulates, mercury and other heavy metals can trigger diseases such as asthma, bronchitis and cancer.The original draft law, presented in April 2022, was watered down during negotiations with the European Parliament and member states.Originally, significantly more agricultural businesses were to be regulated by the directive, as they were identified by the commission as being responsible for high ammonia and methane emissions.This went too far for the parliament in particular. Consequently, cattle farming will remain exempt from the rules. (August 4)",1
28 new people in Belarus sanctioned for government repression by the EU,"In total, EU sanctions on Belarus persons and organizations apply to 261 individuals and 37 entities. The sanctions target people linked to the repression of the public in Belarus.Brussels - The European Union on Monday targeted 28 additional people linked to the ongoing repression of the public in Belarus with new sanctions.A statement from the EU member states criticized the ""deteriorating human rights situation in Belarus"" and condemned the Belarusian regime's continuing persecution of the country's society.The new EUÂ sanctions on the Belarusian regime of President Alexander Lukashenko come ahead of the fourth anniversary of his crackdown on protests in opposition to his re-election in August 2020, denounced by the EUÂ and others as fraudulent.New sanctions bring total to 261 individuals, 37 entitiesAmong the new persons targeted are members of the judiciary, prison officials and the director-general of the biggest State news agency, Belarusian Telegraph Agency (BelTA), Iryna Akulovic.In total, EU sanctions on Belarus persons and organizations apply to 261 individuals and 37 entities. This involves a freeze on assets held in the bloc.In addition, persons and companies in the EUÂ are forbidden from doing business with sanctioned targets in Belarus. Belarus individuals targeted by EU sanctions are also banned from travelling to the bloc. (August 5)",1
Youth and the EU: What challenges they face and how they see the EU,"Five years after the launch of the EU Youth Strategy, young Europeans are grappling with a complex relationship with the EU. While many feel a strong connection to Europe, issues such as unemployment, housing shortages and financial dependence continue to loom large. In November 2018, the Council of the European Union and the representatives of the governments of the member states adopted the EU Youth Strategy, a framework for the EU youth policy cooperation for the period 2019-2027. This EU Youth Strategy is focused on five principles and goals: participation and activity, employment and apprenticeships, education and science, student mobility  and support for youth initiatives and projects.The strategy aims to strengthen ties with the EU, improve the quality of education and reduce youth unemployment. How are young Europeans five years after the adoption of the strategy? How strongly do they identify with the EU? And what do they see as the main benefits of EU membership?Identification with Europe, higher identification with home countryÂ Young people continue to have a European outlook, according to the ""Eurobarometer on Youth and Democracy"" published by the European Commission ahead of the European elections in June.More than 43 percent of respondents have participated in activities in another EU country. Common examples include studying or training (16 percent), volunteering (12 percent) or working (12 percent). Nearly half of the young people surveyed (49 percent) say they are aware of the funding opportunities offered by Erasmus+, the EU's programme for education, training, youth, and sport. 67 percent of young Europeans believe that the EU has at least some impact on their daily life, while 26 percent say it does not and 7 percent don't know.Despite a high level of identification with the EU, many young Europeans define themselves in terms of their nationality rather than their European identity.For example, 79 percent  of young Italians proudly describe themselves as 'children of Europe' and at the same time 8 out of 10 young people feel more Italian than European. These are the results of survey carried out by the portal Skuola.net on a sample of 3,100 Italian girls and boys aged between 13 and 29, before the European elections 2024.However, not all countries have young people who strongly identify with the EU. The briefing paper, based on GLOBSEC data from 2023 and 2024 on Bulgarian public opinion in relation to key dimensions of domestic and international socio-political attitudes, notes that 71 percent  of young Bulgarians perceive the EU as dictatorial. This is reflected in the very strong perception that â€œthe EU dictates what to do without Bulgaria having the power to influence it.â€Peace and freedom of travel: Important achievements and high expectationsAround half of young Europeans consider the freedom of travel as one of the most important achievements of the EU, according to the â€œYoung Europe 2024â€ study conducted by data analytics company YouGov for the German TUI Care Foundation. Other major achievements cited by young people include freedom of movement to work and study in the EU, the Euro as joint currency and exchange programmes such as ERASMUS+.The survey carried out by the portal Skuola.net shows: For young Italians, the least favourable aspects are the economic constraints that the country must submit to in order to be part of the EU (40 percent), the management of migrants (25 percent) and, finally, Italy's dependence on stronger nations (19 percent) in many aspects of community policy. According to the May Eurobarometer survey, Slovenian youth's expectations of the EU are to preserve peace, strengthen international security and promote international cooperation. Slovenians are also above the European average in their expectations of the fight against poverty and economic and social inequality.Unemployment, housing costs, and financial dependency worry young EuropeansAccording to the â€œYoung Europe 2024â€ study, young people consider migration, climate change and economic policy to be the most important current political issues in the EU. However, young people in many countries are also concerned about their personal financial situation and living standards. In Slovenia, the main problems of young people are related to a lack of affordable housing and regular jobs, even though Slovenia has one of the lowest unemployment rates among under 25-year-olds, according to Eurostat data from June. The rate in the country stands at 7.8 percent, compared to an EU-wide rate of 14.4 percent. Due to the housing shortage and lack of regular jobs young people are becoming independent from their parents later. The rising incidence of mental health problems among young people, including in the wake of the pandemic, is also worrying. For young Romanians, the lack of well-paid jobs, the missing quality of the education system and problems related to the standard of living remain the main challenges,  according to a nationwide survey entitled ""Young people in Romania in the election year 2024"" conducted by the Romanian Institute for Evaluation and Strategy (IRES). The survey found that the EU is the second most trusted institution (51 percent), after academia (56 percent ), while the press is one of the least trusted. According to the Youth and democracy Eurobarometer published by the European Commission in May ahead of the European Parliament elections, Romania recorded the highest percentages in the EU in terms of young people's involvement in changing society (57 percent)  and the impact of EU actions on their daily lives (41 percent).More than a third of young people in Romania have little or no trust in the country's democracy. Young people's interest in politics is low (only 6 percent). The lack of hope leads two out of three young Romanians to consider a temporary or permanent migration from Romania, with 68 percent of them believing that the country is going in the wrong direction.For young Spaniards, unemployment remains the biggest problem. One in four young people there remains unemployed. According to Eurostat, Spain was the EU member state with the highest youth unemployment rate in June this year, standing at 25.9 percent. The average for the EU was 14.4 percent.Sentiment among young people in accession candidate countriesThe green light given to Bosnia and Herzegovina to start negotiations with the European Union in March this year marked an important step forward in the EU accession process and provided numerous opportunities to improve conditions for the country's youth.There is a visible interest of young people in BiH for integration into the European Union, however, many are sceptical due to slow progress in reforms and political obstacles within the country. The European Commission report from 2023 states that the political climate often suffers due to ethnic tensions and rhetoric that undermines state institutions, which further complicates the process of EU integration.Additionally, a 2022 USAID survey showed that young people in BiH are generally pessimistic about the situation in the country, especially due to high levels of unemployment and corruption. Although some aspects are improving, trust in political institutions remains low, which affects their perceptions of EU integration.Despite these challenges, many young people still see the European Union as a key factor for Bosnia and Herzegovina's future progress. Therefore, implementing necessary reforms and achieving a successful outcome in the EU negotiations could bring significant changes, improve conditions for the youth and strengthen their sense of belonging to European values.In the meantime, many young people from BiH have moved to the EU in search of better living conditions, rather than waiting for European standards to arrive in Bosnia and Herzegovina.The EU carried out and implemented strategies to support young people in North Macedonia in their educational, professional and personal development, primarily by stimulating youth participation in civil society. The European Commission's 2023 report on North Macedonia notes that through the European Youth Guarantee program benefits have been provided to more than 9,400 young people in the regions of North Macedonia with the highest youth unemployment rates.However, public opinion polls show that young people in North Macedonia are pessimistic about the commitment and real intentions of politicians to bring about some positive changes in the country. A survey conducted by the Skopje-based NGO think-tank ""Societas Civilis"" in cooperation with the Konrad Adenauer Foundation shows that only 53 percent of the population aged 18-24 fully support North Macedonia's accession to the EU.This article is published twice a week.

EU's Borrell 'horrified' after latest Israeli attack on Gaza school,"In a post on X, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell condemned an Israeli airstrike on a school in Gaza on Saturday.
Brussels (dpa) – The EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has said he is ""horrified"" after an Israeli airstrike hit a school sheltering residents in Gaza on Saturday, which Palestinian authorities said killed up to 100 people.""At least 10 schools were targeted in the last weeks. Thereâ€™s no justification for these massacres,"" the blocâ€™s foreign policy chief wrote on social media platform X.""We are dismayed by the terrible overall death toll,"" he added, saying that more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began in October last year.The Palestinian health ministry, which is controlled by the militant Islamist group Hamas, puts the death toll in Gaza at more than 39,600. The figure does not distinguish between civilians and fighters and cannot be independently verified.Israel has repeatedly said it attacks such facilities because its intelligence has revealed that Hamas operatives are hiding there, using civilians as shields.Borrell said ""a ceasefire is the only way to stop the killing of civilians and secure the hostages' release.""Borrell also used the post to denounce Israel's far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who on Thursday lobbied against a ceasefire by telling Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu not to fall into a ""dangerous trap"" with a ceasefire deal. Borrell condemned Smotrich's comments, saying they are ""against the interest of the Israeli people."" (10 August)",1
Germany remains largest net contributor to EU budget,"In 2023, Germany paid 17.4 billion euros more into the European Union budget than it received. However, experts warn of Germanyâ€™s weak economy and pointed out that this is a lower figure than in 2022 â€“ a trend they expect to continue.Brussels (dpa) – Germany paid significantly more into the EU budget last year than it received from Brussels coffers, according to an analysis conducted by the German Economic Institute (IW) of previously published data from the European Commission.According to the IW's report, published on Monday, Germany paid around 17.4 billion euros more into the EU budget in 2023 than it received, making it the largest net contributor to the European Union. In 2022, that figure was 19.7 billion euros.France is in second place. Last year, Paris paid out almost 9 billion euros more than it received back. Italy is the third highest net contributor, with around 4.5 billion euros.The largest net recipient in 2023 was Poland with 8.2 billion euros. It was followed by Romania with 6.0 billion and Hungary with 4.6 billion.According to the figures, the EU budget totalled 173.1 billion euros in 2023, of which 143.4 billion went to the member states. Added to this were funds from the blocâ€™s Covid-19 recovery fund totalling 66.1 billion euros, of which 64.6 billion went to the member states.As the trade group's largest net contributor, Germany contributed almost a quarter of the funds. The German government emphasises that Germany also benefits more from the EU single market than any other European economy.Experts cite the weak economic situation in Germany as the reason for the country's lower net contribution to the EU.

EU sends help as Greece and Albania battle wildfires,"Under the European Union's Civil Protection Mechanism, which helps European countries respond to disasters, Greece and Albania are receiving assistance as they battle ongoing wildfires.Brussels (dpa) – The European Commission on Tuesday announced that it was activating a system for European countries to help Greece and Albania battle ongoing wildfires.EU member states are sending aid to Greece to help battle a massive wildfire, as the Greek government requested the activation of the European Civil Protection Mechanism, which helps EU countries respond to emergencies.At a press conference on Tuesday, a Commission spokesman said the support to Greece includes two planes from Italy, two helicopters from France and Serbia, as well as ground firefighting crews from the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Romania and Serbia. Romanian, Maltese and Moldovan firefighters were already in Greece, the spokesman said.According to a Commission statement, Albania will receive a military plane from Romania capable of carrying 6 tons of water. The plane will be deployed on Wednesday, the commission said.Serbia and Moldova are not members of the European Union, but along with Albania and several others, they participate in the EU's Civil Protection Mechanism.

Humanitarian crises rage as Geneva Conventions mark 75th anniversary,"The Geneva Conventions were signed 75 years ago and August 19 marks World Humanitarian Day. With conflicts raging all over the world, to what extent do the European Union and its member states provide humanitarian aid to other countries and their citizens in need?The Geneva Conventions, which aim to protect the human rights of civilians caught up in war through international humanitarian law, were signed 75 years ago.The four Geneva Conventions signed on August 12, 1949 have been ratified by 196 countries – by all United Nations members as well as by some other entities which could ratify these international treaties.The strictly neutral International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) is supposed to monitor compliance with the conventions worldwide. With more than 120 active conflicts worldwide today, ICRC President Mirjana Spoljaric appealed to states and groups involved in conflicts around the world to renew their commitment to the Geneva Conventions.The conventions stipulate rules for humanitarian aid relief, stating that â€œparties to the conflict must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians in need, which is impartial in character and conducted without any adverse distinction, subject to their right of controlâ€.August 19 marks World Humanitarian Day, dedicated to recognising humanitarian personnel who strive to support, save and protect people at the front lines of conflicts around the globe, and to commemorate those who have died working for humanitarian causes.On August 19, 2003, 22 humanitarian aid workers including the UN Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Iraq, SÃ©rgio Vieira de Mello, were killed in a bomb attack in the capital city Baghdad. In 2008, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution designating August 19 as World Humanitarian Day.Three decades of EU humanitarian aidEuropean Union member states and institutions are among the worldâ€™s largest donors of humanitarian aid. Since 1992, the European Commission has been providing humanitarian aid in more than 110 countries, reaching millions of people around the world each year.Funding for humanitarian aid operations is intended for countries outside the EU. In addition, the European Commission can finance emergency relief operations to respond to disasters of exceptional scale within the bloc.EU-funded humanitarian aid is provided in collaboration with UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs. It covers various areas of intervention from food and nutrition to accommodation and health care, including water and sanitation or education in emergency situations.The European Commissionâ€™s Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (DG ECHO) was created in 1992 as an expression of European solidarity with people in need around the world. A network of Commission humanitarian experts in more than 40 countries around the world closely monitors crisis situations and relief operations.Aid to Gaza and Ukraine in the spotlightIn February, the Commission announced an initial humanitarian aid budget of more than 1.8 billion Euro for 2024, of which nearly 470 million is to be allocated in the Middle East and North Africa to address the humanitarian needs of Gaza and the Palestinian civilian population, as well as the ongoing regional crises in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and neighbouring countries.In addition to the humanitarian aid provided and/or coordinated by the EU, member states also have their own competences and budgets to provide humanitarian assistance to foreign countries in need.However, earlier this year, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management Janez LenarÄiÄ said that â€œas we enter 2024, the gap between humanitarian needs and resources available continues to widenâ€. He recalled that in 2023 not even 40 percent of the 56.7 billion Dollars needed to accurately respond to humanitarian crises worldwide were provided.Since the war in Gaza broke out on October 7 last year, the humanitarian situation in the Palestinian territory remains dire, with almost all of its 2.4 million population displaced and suffering from food shortages.The EU is the biggest international financial backer of the Palestinians, with its support between 2021 and 2024 estimated at 1.2 billion Euro. At the end of July, the EU said it had begun paying 400 million Euro in emergency funding to the Palestinian Authority to help address its â€œcriticalâ€ budget problems. Brussels said the first 150-million-Euro tranche includes grants to help pay the salaries of civil servants in the West Bank and support vulnerable families. It also said that in early September it will introduce a legislative proposal for a â€œComprehensive Programme for Palestinian Recovery and Resilienceâ€.In July, the Romanian government approved emergency humanitarian aid worth about 1.7 million Euro to the civilian population in Gaza, consisting of food and shelter items. Since the beginning of Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine in 2022, Romania has also been providing constant humanitarian aid to support Ukrainian citizens.Slovenia has set a target of increasing the level of its development and humanitarian aid from 0.29 percent of its GNP in 2022 to 0.33 percent by 2030. The country has responded to crises such as in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as to the food crises in African countries. At the end of July, its government decided to allocate 3.3 million Euro to international humanitarian organisations until 2026.North Macedonia was also among the first countries that provided military, technical and humanitarian aid to Ukraine after the Russian aggression. In the period from 2022 to February 2024, it delivered twelve aid packages with a total value of 60 million Euro.The EU has staunchly opposed Russiaâ€™s war, slapping 14 rounds of unprecedented sanctions on Moscow and giving Ukraine tens of billions of Euro in assistance – not only in the form of military support but also including humanitarian aid.The UNHCR logo is placed on a self-build hut. Photo: Annette Riedl/dpaCalls for increased attention to conflicts in AfricaEven as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza dominate the news, conflicts continue to rage in other parts of the world – such as in regions and countries in Africa.In May, Abdouraouf Gnon-Konde, an official of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office, stressed the need to take action immediately to address humanitarian crises in the Sahel region or other countries will be drawn in and it will â€œbecome a problem for the worldâ€.The official was on a visit to Brussels to urge EU officials to stay focused on the African regions where some 10.5 million people have been displaced by conflict. The day before, he participated in an EU-hosted donorsâ€™ conference for the Sahel. At the event, the European Commission pledged 201 million Euro for vulnerable people in Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger and Nigeria.Conflict also rages in the northeastern African country Sudan, which lies south of Egypt. A power struggle between the army and paramilitary militias has been going on since April 2023. Millions of people are on the run within the country itself or have fled across the borders to neighbouring countries.Will Carter, the Norwegian Refugee Councilâ€™s country director in Sudan, said the conference in Brussels was a â€œgenuine attempt to revive the worldâ€™s effortsâ€ with the funds pledged â€œdesperately needed to save millions of livesâ€.In April, world donors pledged about two billion Dollars in humanitarian aid for Sudan. French President Emmanuel Macron announced that about 900 million came from the EU and EU countries.This article is published twice a week.

Contested EU Nature Restoration Law enters into force,"On Sunday, August 17, the controversial EU's Nature Restoration Law entered into force. Prior to its adoption earlier this year, the law has been the subject of heated political debate and protests across the bloc.Brussels (dpa) – A much fought-over nature conservation law intended to restore habitats to their natural condition came into force on Sunday, August 17, as announced by the European Commission.The conservation law sets a target for the European Union to restore at least 20 percent of the bloc's land and sea areas by 2030 and all ecosystems in need of restoration by 2050 by regrowing forests, re-wetting moors and returning rivers to their natural, free-flowing states.The law had previously been the subject of long and heated debate. In the end, a narrow majority voted in favour of a watered-down version of the legal text. EU member states in the Council of the EU gave their final approval to the law in June. The law is considered controversial particularly because of fears of heavy restrictions on farmers. In 2023 and 2024, farmers from across the EU protested against the law, including several intense demonstrations in Brussels.The Commission said that EU member states would themselves decide which specific measures are to be implemented on their territory.According to EU figures, around 80 percent of habitats are in poor condition. In addition, 10 percent of bee and butterfly species are threatened with extinction and 70 percent of soils are in an unhealthy state. (17 August)",1
European Commission approves German state aid for Dresden chip factory,"A new chip factory in the German city Dresden will be the first of its kind in Europe. According to the European Commission, it will strengthen Europeâ€™s position as a producer of semiconductor technologies.Brussels (dpa) – The European Commission announced on Tuesday that it has approved German state aid for a new chip factory in the city Dresden located in the east of Germany.The approval allows the German federal government to provide five billion euros of financial support for the new European Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (ESMC).""The measure will strengthen Europe's security of supply, resilience and digital sovereignty in semiconductor technologies,"" the Commission said in a statement. ""The measure will also contribute to achieving the digital and green transitions.""The Commission said that it had considered the fact that the factory is the first of its kind in Europe. ""ESMC will be the first open foundry that will produce silicon wafers with 28/22nm and 16/12nm technology nodes, using FinFET technology with logic, mixed-signal, radio frequency and embedded non-volatile memory technology processes,"" the EU executive said.""These specific technologies differentiate it from other existing capacity and complement the production capacities needed by European customers.""The Commission said the state aid will have an ""incentive effect"" because ""the beneficiary would not carry out this investment without public support.""

German environmental activists lodge complaint with EU Commission over LNG terminal funding,"Environmental Action Germany (DUH) believes that state aid for a liquefied natural gas terminal does not contribute to promoting the green energy transition and achieving climate goals, which are prerequisites for state aid in this area under EU law.Berlin (dpa) – Environmental Action Germany (DUH) has lodged a complaint with the European Commission challenging state funding amounting to 40 million euros for a planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in northern Germany.According to European Union law, state subsidies for energy projects are only permissible if they contribute to promoting the green energy transition and achieving climate goals, DUH stated on Tuesday. This, DUH argued, is not the case with the LNG terminal, according to a legal opinion.""The approval of this multimillion-euro state aid rests on very shaky ground,"" said the federal managing director of DUH, Sascha MÃ¼ller-Kraenner.He said there were no reliable plans on how the terminal should be converted to renewable energies, even though the European Commission had approved the aid on the condition that the terminal would be converted to green gases. Therefore, DUH is urging the European Commission to withdraw the approval for the multimillion-euro state funding for the import of natural gas.MÃ¼ller-Kraenner said that ""this money must be invested in effective climate protection measures and not in the continuation of an outdated fossil-fuel business model.""Since DUH is not directly affected by the financing of the LNG terminal, it cannot file a lawsuit. However, the official complaint procedure clearly indicates that the environmental organisation has concerns. According to DUH, the European Commission decides how to proceed with this complaint.

How the Israel-Hamas war is fuelling anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim racism in Europe,"The International Day Commemorating the Victims of Acts of Violence based on Religion or Belief takes place this Thursday, on August 22. A study by the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance shows that key challenges in Europe remain the rise in anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim racism as a result of the current Middle East conflict. Following the Hamas terror attack against Israel on October 7, 2023 and Israelâ€™s subsequent war in Gaza, several European countries have reported a spike in anti-Semitism, and in some countries the number of hate incidents against Muslims has multiplied. These are the findings of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI) in its annual report on the main trends observed in 2023. ECRI is the Council of Europe's human rights monitoring body, specialising in issues related to the fight against racism, discrimination, xenophobia, antisemitism and intolerance. â€œIn several states, the number of anti-Semitic incidents reported in the last three months of 2023 far exceeded the number usually reported for an entire year, and in some cases was much higher,â€ the statement of the ECRI said. At the same time, the study found that â€œin the aftermath of the Hamas terror attack of 7 October 2023 against Israel the number of hate incidents against Muslims increased manifoldâ€. It was also said that â€œMuslims received blame for the attack and other attacks in the Middle East, based on stereotyping of whole communities and their perceived connections with the use of violenceâ€.Muslims are also often unfairly blamed for crimes committed in Europe. An example of this is the recent events in the UK following the murder of three girls aged nine, seven and six. Initially, false rumours spread on social media that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. The suspect was later identified as a 17-year-old who was born in Wales. British media reported that his parents were from Rwanda. Despite the police statement, initial disturbances in Southport centred around a mosque, and widespread violence has rocked England and Northern Ireland since.The acts of anti-Semitism have covered a wide range of incidents, from hate speech, online and offline – including death threats – to acts of vandalism and destruction of Jewish community sites, such as synagogues and cemeteries, to physical attacks against Jews, the ECRI said. The Commission â€œis particularly concernedâ€ that many of these incidents have occurred in schools â€œwhich should be places where future generations learn about and practice diversity, inclusion and mutual respectâ€. Europeâ€™s Jewish community is experiencing a â€œrising tide of anti-Semitismâ€, the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) reported in July. â€œThe spillover effect of the conflict in the Middle East is eroding hard-fought-for progressâ€ in tackling anti-Jewish hate, FRAâ€™s director Sirpa Rautio said. This was jeopardising the success of the EUâ€™s first-ever strategy on combating the issue adopted in 2021, she added.To assess the impact the conflict in the Middle East has had on anti-Semitism in Europe, the report relied on information collected from twelve Jewish organisations in 2024. â€œFRAâ€™s consultation with national and European Jewish umbrella organisations in early 2024 shows a dramatic surgeâ€ in antisemitic attacks, Rautio said. In France, 74 percent of Jews felt the conflict affected their sense of security, the highest rate among the countries surveyed. Across Europe, 76 percent reported hiding their Jewish identity â€œat least occasionallyâ€ and 34 percent avoid Jewish events or sites â€œbecause they do not feel safeâ€, a press release accompanying the report said.On a positive note, the ECRIâ€™s report said that many heads of EU member states and representatives of national, regional or local authorities and civil society organisations, as well as politicians and personalities from the world of culture and religion, among others, have publicly demonstrated their solidarity with Jewish communities in Europe since October 7. The report mentioned that some governments have also increased the security measures necessary to protect Jewish institutions from antisemitic violence and potential terrorist attacks and continue to do so. The opposite trend seems to be true for Muslim communities. The ECRI highlighted that  â€œthere have been several cases of speeches by politicians and other public figures in which aspects of anti-Muslim racism have been mixed with general xenophobic discourse or who have used the threat of a so-called Islamisation of European societies, to gain votes in electionsâ€. â€œThose who use this latter narrative exploit peopleâ€™s ignorance,â€ said the ECRI chair Bertil Cottier. â€œPublic figures, not only politicians but also those in entertainment and sports, should say that such discourse is unacceptable,â€ he added.France, which is home to one of the largest Muslim populations in Europe, with around six million people of Islamic faith or background, recorded 242 anti-Muslim acts in 2023, the interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, said in February. He added that this was an increase of almost 30 percent on the previous year.Situation of Jews before the outbreak of war in GazaThe FRA survey, however, does not only refer to the situation of Jews in Europe after the Hamas attack on Israel, but also to how Jews described their situation before the war in Gaza broke out. 80 percent of Jews surveyed said they feel anti-Semitism has worsened in recent years. The most common â€œnegative stereotypesâ€ those questioned listed as encountered included the accusation that Jews were â€œholding power and control over finance, media, politics or economyâ€. Many also reported encountering denials of Israelâ€™s right to exist as a state.A total of four percent of respondents in 2023 said they had experienced antisemitic physical attacks in the twelve months prior to the survey – double the number recorded in 2018. About 60 percent of those asked said they were not satisfied with their national governmentsâ€™ efforts to combat anti-Semitism.The survey covered 13 EU countries home to 96 percent of the blocâ€™s Jewish population: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Spain and Sweden. Here are some examples from this study and a report by the US State Department.Current state of anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim racism in Austria, Germany, Bulgaria, and Romania:Austria: 76 percent of respondents in the FRA study believe that antisemitism has increased in the five years prior to the survey. The EU average was 80 percent. For the year prior to the survey, 38 percent in this country reported having been the victim of antisemitic hostility - similar to the EU average. Five percent were also attacked that year. As a result of these experiences, many people feel compelled to hide their religion in public. In Austria, 29 percent of Jews never wear Jewish symbols in public due to security concerns. The Documentation Centre on Islamophobia and Anti-Muslim Racism recorded 1,522 cases of racist attacks on Muslims in 2023. This is the highest number since the documentation began in 2015, said the head of the documentation centre, Rumeysa DÃ¼r-Kwieder, at the presentation of the report in Vienna in May. The number of reported cases has risen particularly sharply since the escalation of violence in the Middle East following Hamasâ€™ terrorist attack on Israel in October. Germany: Following Hamasâ€™ terrorist attack on Israel, anti-Semitic incidents also increased sharply in Germany. The Federal Criminal Police Office recorded 715 antisemitic offences in Germany in the second quarter of 2024, including 19 acts of violence resulting in seven injuries. This figure is more than a third higher than a year earlier. Bulgaria: At the end of June, the US State Departmentâ€™s 2023 International Religious Freedom Report highlighted an increase in anti-Semitism and harassment of religious minorities in Bulgaria. The report suggests that despite a legal ban on the propagation of fascism or other antidemocratic ideologies, authorities rarely enforced the law, and souvenirs with Nazi insignias were available in tourist areas around the country. Some political parties and leaders continued to use antisemitic language and images. The report added that the Jewish nongovernmental organisation (NGO) Shalom repeatedly expressed concerns regarding escalating public hate speech and antisemitism, including on social networks, and offensive graffiti.The report also details numerous instances of restricted religious freedoms and violent actions against members of religious minorities.Romania: â€œRomania is one of the very few countries in Europe, perhaps the only one, where there have been no attacks against Jewish communities and Jewish life unfolds without incidents,â€ said the President of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Romania (FCER), Silviu Vexler, in June at the launch of the National Strategy for Preventing and Combating Anti-Semitism, Xenophobia, Radicalisation and Hate Speech 2024–2027. The general objectives of the strategy are: to prevent and combat antisemitism, xenophobia, radicalisation and hate speech. The strategy also seeks to promote education for inclusion, to promote knowledge of Jewish culture, and to support these efforts at the international level.Borrellâ€™s call to respect the Universal Declaration on Human Rights (UDHR)â€œEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion,â€ reads Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is now 76 years old.On the occasion of 75th anniversary of its adoption, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Josep Borrell, had issued a statement on behalf of the 27 Member States, joined by the candidate countries North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and Bosnia and Herzegovina, the potential candidate country Georgia, the EFTA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, members of the European Economic Area, as well as Armenia.In that statement, Borrell regretted that despite the time that has passed since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which enshrined the right of all human beings to have, change and manifest their religion or belief, â€œtoo many people in many parts of the world still suffer threats, physical attacks, killings, discrimination and persecution solely on the basis of their religion or beliefâ€.â€œThe European Union continues to stand up for freedom of religion and belief, abroad and at homeâ€ Josep Borrell, EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security PolicyHow do EU countries punish religious violence?According to a report published by the Spanish Observatory for Religious Freedom and Conscience (OLRC) on the protection of religious feelings in the EU, a total of 21 EU Member States punish offences against the religious feelings of citizens, and all of those that criminalise these offences provide for prison sentences. Editorial note: With regard to the inconsistencies in sources, the information on EU countries that do not punish offences against religious feelings has been deleted.This article is published twice a week.

EU emergency response kicks into high gear as wildfires blaze,"The European Unionâ€™s emergency response mechanism is working at full speed as wildfires ravage across Europe this summer. Multiple countries including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Portugal struggle to contain the blazes â€“ their EU partners are sending help.As wildfires continue to affect multiple European countries, the European Unionâ€™s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) is working 24/7 to channel assistance to help tackle the blazes, the European Commission said earlier in August.Over the course of July and August, wildfires have been ravaging in several European countries, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, North Macedonia and Portugal. In response, the EU has activated its Civil Protection Mechanism (EUCPM) for countries that need help from their partners to combat the devastating and deadly blazes.To boost preparedness measures for this summerâ€™s fire season, the Commission has set up the rescEU and European Civil Protection Pool with aerial capacities that now include 28 airplanes and four helicopters stationed in ten member states.According to the European Commission, 556 firefighters from twelve countries are strategically prepositioned across key locations in Europe – in France, Greece, Portugal, and Spain – ready to help local fire brigades if forest fires break out. What is the EU Civil Protection Mechanism?The European Commission established the EUCPM in 2001. It aims to strengthen cooperation between participating countries on civil protection, to improve prevention, preparedness, and response to disasters. Any country can request assistance via the EUCPM when struck by an emergency. The Commission plays a key role in coordinating the disaster response worldwide, contributing to at least 75 percent of the transport and/or operational costs of deployments.In addition to all EU countries, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iceland, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia, TÃ¼rkiye, and Ukraine also participate, even though they are not (yet) members of the bloc. Bosnia and Herzegovina, for example, officially joined the EUCPM in 2022 – a milestone for the country on the way to being granted EU candidate status that same year. Volunteers extinguish a forest fire in Ano Patima near Penteli in Greece. Photo: Socrates Baltagiannis/dpaFires near Athens: â€œEU solidarity in actionâ€Earlier in August, a massive wildfire in Athensâ€™ northeastern suburbs forced thousands of residents to flee their homes and triggered a Greek government appeal for international help. According to experts, this was the first time that a major fire had come so close to the Greek capital. In the wake of the fires, Greece formally called on the EU for assistance on August 12. Since then, several EU member states have been sending aid to the country. A European Commission spokesman said the support to Greece included two planes from Italy, two helicopters from France and Serbia, and ground firefighting crews from the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Romania and Serbia. Romanian, Maltese and Moldovan firefighters were already in Greece, the spokesman said.Romania has deployed dozens of firefighters and special equipment to be ready to put out fires in Greece between August 1 and September 15. This is the fourth consecutive year that it has responded to such requests. Romanian firefighters have also carried out similar missions in previous years in France, Slovenia and North Macedonia.Referring to the widespread support for Greece, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a post on X: â€œThis is EU solidarity in action.â€https://twitter.com/vonderleyen/status/1823030142899290538EU mobilises further support across the continentOver the summer, the EU has also mobilised support to help fight fires affecting Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Portugal after they activated the disaster response mechanism.Albania: Two Romanian planes arrived in Albania in August to help isolate and extinguish fires in some areas of the country. The Albanian Ministry of Defense announced that on August 14 and 16 the Romanian planes â€œSpartanâ€ and â€œHerculesâ€ intervened to extinguish fires in the cities of Pogradec and Berat.Bosnia and Herzegovina: The Council of Ministers of BiH asked its neighbouring countries for help in extinguishing the fires that hit the country this year. Assistance was requested in the form of firefighting units and firefighting aircraft from countries with which BiH has signed agreements and memoranda on cooperation in protection and rescue through the EUCPM. The decision will be valid as long as the danger of fire continues during 2024.Bulgaria: Bulgaria received dozens of aircraft, including airplanes and helicopters, to battle wildfires caused by a heatwave in mid-July. The Bulgarian government has expressed gratitude for the help and support provided under the EUCPM. North Macedonia: In mid-July, planes from Croatia, Serbia, Slovenia, and TÃ¼rkiye were being deployed in North Macedonia to help contain a string of blazes across the country amid a heatwave. Hundreds of hectares of forest had been burnt and authorities identified twelve active wildfires at the time.Portugal: On Wednesday, the Portuguese government announced that it decided to activate the EUCPM to combat a fire that has been raging on the island of Madeira (an autonomous region of Portugal) since August 14. Data from the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) showed more than 4,930 hectares of burnt area. With this decision, the way is open for Canadair planes to be sent from Spain, which had already announced its willingness to spare two aircraft. They arrived on the island on Thursday, August 22.Floods in Slovenia and Italy in 2023Slovenia learned about the importance of the EUCPM in the biggest fire in its history in the summer of 2022 and notably the catastrophic floods that affected two thirds of the country in August 2023. In the wake of the floods, the country received support from the mechanism in a variety of forms, from air support for firefighting in the Karst region along the border with Italy, to heavy construction equipment, helicopters and other flood relief.In May 2023, the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy was also hit by devastating floods. Following the activation of the EUCPM, two high-capacity water pumping teams from Slovakia and Slovenia were sent to Ravenna. Further help had been offered by Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Poland and Romania.More than firefighting: EUCPM provides in medical and humanitarian emergencies tooWhile the mechanism is most prominently triggered by natural disasters, assistance can also be requested for other emergencies, such as health crises and humanitarian disasters in conflict-ridden areas. On July 24, the first EU-coordinated rescue of 16 Palestinian children and their family members, who were in need of medical attention, took place. They were brought from Egypt to Spain with financial and operational support from the EUCPM, in close coordination with the World Health Organization (WHO), the Palestine Childrenâ€™s Relief Fund (PCRF) and the Palestinian authorities.Since early January, the EU has also been supporting the WHO Gaza Emergency Medical Teams Coordination Cell in Cairo, with 22 experts deployed from the EU and EUCPM participating countries.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the EU has coordinated the deployment of medical teams to the most affected areas, facilitated the procurement of additional protective equipment and activated the ERCC to coordinate support 24/7.Furthermore, in the face of Russiaâ€™s war in Ukraine, the European Commission is coordinating a large operation under the EUCPM. The 27 EU countries (plus Iceland, North Macedonia, Norway, Serbia and TÃ¼rkiye) have offered assistance ranging from medical supplies and shelter items to vehicles and energy equipment. The EU has also established logistics centres in Poland, Romania and Slovakia to channel goods to Ukraine more efficiently.This article is published twice a week.

EU 'extremely concerned' about post-election crisis in Venezuela,"The European Unionâ€™s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, has urged the Venezuelan election authority to release the official voting records of the disputed July 28 election, in which the socialist NicolÃ¡s Maduro claimed victory despite demonstrations against the result.Brussels (dpa) – The European Union's foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, on Sunday released a statement saying the bloc ""remains extremely concerned about the deepening political crisis in Venezuela,"" following a disputed presidential election in the South American country.Borrell's statement follows the decision by the Venezuelan Supreme Court last Thursday to confirm government claims that the socialist and incumbent President NicolÃ¡s Maduro won the July 28 election.But countries including the United States, Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, Panama, Uruguay and Costa Rica have recognised opposition candidate Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia  as the true winner, alleging electoral fraud.In a statement issued on behalf of the EU on Sunday, Borrell urged Venezuela's election authority to ""publish and independently verify"" the voting records or ""actas"" of all polling stations. ""The reviewed 'actas' published by the opposition exhibit the security features of the original result protocols, thereby confirming their reliability,"" Borrell said.""According to the publicly available copies of the 'actas,' Edmundo GonzÃ¡lez Urrutia would appear to be the winner of the presidential election by a significant majority, the blocâ€™s top diplomat said""""Venezuelan authorities must respect the right of all Venezuelans to peacefully demonstrate and freely express their political opinions without fear of reprisal,"" he added. ""They must refrain from using excessive force, end the repression and harassment of the opposition and civil society, and release all political prisoners.""Earlier this month, a United Nations report said at least 1,260 people had been detained and 23 killed since the election amid ""fierce repression by the state."" Maduro himself said on August 3 that 2,000 people had been detained and would be punished. ""This time there will be no pardon,"" he told his supporters. (25 August)",1
EU Commission proposes to cut 2025 cod and salmon catch quotas in Baltic Sea,"Based on scientific analysis by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the European Commission is concerned about the poor state of fish stocks in the Baltic Sea and the environmental threats they face.Brussels (dpa) – The European Commission on Monday proposed slashing catch quotas for cod, salmon and sprat in the Baltic Sea in 2025 due to the ""dire situation"" of the waters' key fishing stocks.European Commission Executive Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said in a statement that despite efforts to rebuild fish populations he was ""worried about the poor state of the Baltic Sea fish stocks."" The Slovak is temporarily responsible for the environment, oceans and fisheries portfolios following the resignation in July of former Lithuanian Commissioner Virginijus SinkeviÄius, who is now an MEP.According to the Commission's proposals, catches of western and eastern cod are to be reduced by 73 percent and 68 percent respectively compared to 2024. Sprat is to be reduced by 42 percentCatch limits for salmon in the Gulf of Finland are to be reduced by 20 percent while the salmon catch in the main basin of the Baltic Sea is to be reduced further by 36 percent. Western herring should be reduced by 50 percent. However, the Commission suggested increasing catch limits for herring in the central Baltic by 108 percent and 10 percent in the Gulf of Riga.The Commission said the proposals were based on scientific analysis from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES).The proposed catch limits are to be debated and approved by EU member states. The catch limits are then shared in national quotas that determine how many fish an EU country may catch.As well as the risk of overfishing, fish stocks in the Baltic are also under threat due to environmental issues. Biodiversity loss, climate change and elevated levels of pollutants like litter and pharmaceutical waste pose a threat to fishing stocks, the Commission said. (26 August)",1
"Mpox: WHO seeks 135m USD to battle new variant, experts see “low risk” for Europe
","In mid-August, the World Health Organization declared the highest level of alarm due to mpox outbreaks in a number of African countries and a new, potentially more dangerous variant. While the risk in Europe is low according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, calls for solidarity and vaccine sharing emerge.Â On August 13, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) declared mpox – formerly monkeypox – to be a continent-wide public health emergency and asked for international help in achieving its target of providing two million vaccinesThe World Health Organization (WHO) one day later declared the highest level of alarm due to the mpox outbreaks in Africa and a potentially more contagious new variant but advised against panic following the first imported case in Europe. The virus causes a rash, fever, and muscle pain. Symptoms are mainly treated by medication to prevent fever, pain or allergic reaction. There are two vaccines, but they are in short supply in Africa. Mpox was first detected in humans in 1970, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is considered endemic to countries in central and west Africa.New variant detected beyond Africa but mpox â€œnot the new COVIDâ€A  new clade – or variant – has been circulating in the DRC since late last year. According to the WHO, more than 18,000 suspected cases with 575 deaths have been registered in the country this year.The viral illness has spread to other African countries in recent weeks, including Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda which count more than 200 confirmed infections with the new variant Ib. Cases of the variant have also been registered in people in Sweden and Thailand who had travelled to Africa.  Experts believe the new variant (called clade I) is likely more contagious than previous strains and can cause a more severe infection. However, mpox is generally not easily transmitted, with direct contact needed for spread.Briefing journalists on August 20, the WHOâ€™s regional director for Europe Hans Kluge said that the virus has been circulating in the region in an earlier, less aggressive variant, known as clade II, since the previous outbreak in 2022. According to Kluge, around 100 cases of this variant are currently occurring per month in Europe and â€œmpox isnâ€™t the new COVIDâ€. â€œWe know quite a lot about clade II already,â€ Kluge said, adding that â€œwe still have to learn more about clade Iâ€œ, causing the epidemic in Central and East Africa. In July 2022, the WHO announced a first â€œPublic Health Emergency of International Concernâ€ (PHEIC) related to mpox which was declared over in May 2023. During the 2022-2023 outbreak, over 22,000 cases of mpox were reported in Europe. On Monday, the WHO estimated that it will need 135 million US Dollars over the next six months to combat mpox, not including the cost of two million vaccine doses, according to a planning paper from the UN health agency. The money is to chiefly be invested in diagnostic tests and research, the WHO said.No European public health emergency, solidarity is key to tackling outbreakAccording to a European Commission spokesperson on August 20, the current situation in Europe shouldnâ€™t â€œbe considered a public health emergencyâ€. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated in a risk assessment that more imported cases â€œwill likely occurâ€ but considers the risk of the new mpox variant for the general public of the EU/EEA as low.After a meeting with the ECDC and the European Medicine Agency (EMA), the Health Security Committee of the European Commission concluded that measures such as border controls or extending vaccinations to the general public are not necessary. The European Commission has asked member states about their intention to donate mpox vaccines to affected African countries and offered to coordinate the effort. Stella Kyriakides, EU Commissioner for Health and Food Safety, on August 22 sent a letter to the EUâ€™s health ministers calling for coordinated action in a â€œspirit of global solidarity and cooperationâ€ through the Team Europe approach which was also used during the COVID pandemic.https://twitter.com/SKyriakidesEU/status/1826886152093122766/The European Union will send 175,420 doses of vaccines to the Africa CDC to prevent mpox, the European Commission announced in mid-August. The commission said in a statement that it would supply the vaccines via its Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA). Pharmaceutical firm Bavarian Nordic, which manufactures the vaccine, will donate 40,000 doses to HERA, the statement said.On Monday, a German government spokesman said that the country was donating 100,000 doses of mpox vaccine to African countries affected by the disease from army stocks. In the medium term, Germany, together with European partners, will also support the African Union in setting up local vaccine production, he said.EU countries are preparing themselvesSeveral European countries are advising their citizens to be vigilant when it comes to travelling to affected areas, implementing measures in case of possible infections while recommendations for vaccinations remain limited to at-risk groups. EU and national health authorities remain calm but alert. In Sweden, where the first case of the new variant in Europe was detected in mid-August, a special governmental crisis group called GSS had been activated.â€œI take the situation seriously, but there is no reason for a major worry. The risk of spreading is low and we have a good preparedness for this, with good routines in the health system,â€ Swedenâ€™s Health Minister Jakob Forssmed said earlier this month.Sweden has announced new travelling advice to people that need to visit the most affected countries in Africa, and also recommendations on who might need a vaccine.â€œMost people going there do not need to be vaccinated. Vaccination may be relevant for health- and hospital personnel, aid workers or others that will be in the most affected area. We have enough vaccines for anyone covered by these recommendations,â€ chief epidemiologist Magnus GisslÃ©n told Swedish News Agency TT.The Czech health ministry said that people travelling to the African countries where the disease has been reported should consult a vaccination and travel medicine centre on the suitability of vaccination and other preventive measures. A spokesman further said that there were enough vaccines available in the country. The Spanish Ministry of Health insists that Spain has a sufficient stock of vaccines, too. On August 21, the Minister of Health, MÃ³nica GarcÃ­a, sent a message of â€œcalm, caution and scientific rigorâ€ regarding the mpox virus to the people. GarcÃ­a further said:  â€œWe are going to go, as always, hand in hand with scientific rigor and the recommendations coordinated at European and global level.â€The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) expects that the new variant is â€œprobablyâ€ also coming to the Netherlands. â€œAs soon as we have a case of the new variant, the person will be isolated and there will be a source and contact investigation. People are on standby for that. We expect to be able to contain the spread quickly,â€ the RIVM informed. The Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport stated that there are â€œaroundâ€ 100,000 vaccines available, deemed â€œampleâ€ in view of the infection numbers since the mpox outbreak in 2022. The Italian National Institute of Health (ISS) doesnâ€™t currently recommend vaccines for the general population, stating that  â€œvaccination is currently offered to certain categories of people most at riskâ€. The countryâ€™s Ministry of Health has set up a webpage dedicated to mpox including information on the disease or vaccination strategy and vaccination centres as well as a section on fake news among other subjects. The Slovenian National Institute of Public Health (NIJZ) estimates that vaccination of the general population against mpox is currently neither necessary nor recommended. Vaccination is recommended for laboratory workers and highly exposed health workers, as well as for humanitarian workers planning to work in affected areas.After the first case of the new mpox variant was reported in Europe, Bulgarian health authorities said the risk of the disease spreading in the country was minimal and hence did not foresee further special measures to contain the infection. Fact check:  WHO mpox emergency declaration does not advise lockdownsAfter the World Health Organization declared the mpox outbreak a global health emergency in August 2024, social media posts and an online article claimed the UN agency had ordered governments to prepare for large-scale lockdowns in anticipation of a new pandemic. The fact-checking team of Agence France-Presse (AFP) debunked these claims, explaining that the WHO provides technical assistance to member states, cannot mandate specific health measures and has not recommended travel restrictions.Read AFPâ€™s full fact check here: https://factcheck.afp.com/doc.afp.com.36EE2D8This article is published twice a week.

"Use of AI in German businesses stagnating, survey suggests","According to a survey, the use of artificial intelligence in German companies remains low compared to some other European Union countries. However, the country ranks ahead of the European Union average.Berlin (dpa) – The uptake of artificial intelligence (AI) in the German economy has stagnated, a survey conducted for the German Economy Ministry by the Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW) suggested on Wednesday. Only 11.6 percent of German companies used AI in 2023, the study said, a rise of just 1 percent compared to 2021.The survey result comes despite widespread excitement generated by new tools such as ChatGPT.Christian Rammer, the surveyâ€™s lead author, said the findings were ""surprising"" as AI has become a defining technological trend in recent years.Germany does rank well ahead of the European Union average (8 percent), but lags behind pioneering countries such as Denmark, Finland, Belgium and the Netherlands. German companies in the consulting and business services sectors performed best, ranking among the top three EU countries for their use of AI.Rammer said the figures could be an underestimate, as around 5 percent of companies surveyed reported that they were not using AI, despite having recorded using the technology in previous surveys.""These companies have either stopped using AI in the meantime, or the AI processes have become such a natural part of business activities that the respondents were not aware of them,"" he said.

Declining performance and persistent staff shortages in education across Europe,"Students return to classrooms after the summer as Europeâ€™s education systems continue to struggle with falling performance and a shortage of qualified teachers. An OECD study published in December 2023 showed a decline in studentsâ€™ basic skills and competences such as mathematics, reading and science. How does the EU promote quality education across the bloc?As the summer holidays draw to a close, millions of European students prepare to return to their classrooms, a yearly ritual marking a new cycle of one of societiesâ€™ critical tasks: to educate the next generation.In the European Union, member states hold the primary responsibility over education policies. The EU and its institutions play a pivotal role in supporting national education systems through initiatives like exchange programs and cross-border collaborations, aiming to foster student mobility, enhance learning opportunities, and thus promote a cohesive educational framework across its 27-country bloc.The education sector faces a range of structural problems, such as staff shortages and poor working conditions in schools, which pose a challenge to teachers coping with large numbers of students in classes.A study conducted in 2022 by the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) – run by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) – showed a decline in student performance globally, with Europe experiencing an unprecedented drop in educational performance in several key learning areas and subjects such as mathematics and reading.The OECD has 38 member countries, of which 22 are EU member states. EU promotes higher education and student mobilityEuropean Union citizens are able to study, travel, look for work, settle down and even retire wherever they like across the bloc.This is a core value of the EU commonly known as â€œfreedom of movementâ€.EU universities are required to open their doors by offering equal opportunities to all potential students from member states. While entrance qualifications vary widely from university to university, being a citizen of another member state should not be a reason for exclusion.In 1999, ministers of 29 European countries launched the Bologna Process, an intergovernmental higher education reform process named after the Bologna Declaration. In short, it aims to simplify the comparison and recognition of degrees abroad and makes it easier to study abroad, both within Europe and internationally.The Bologna Process currently counts 49 member countries, as well as the European Commission, the European University Association (EUA) and other international organisations and partners. June 19 marked the 25th anniversary since the launch of the Bologna Process.Exchange programmes, such as the EUâ€™s Erasmus+ programme, allow school pupils, students and apprentices to study and gain experience in member states other than their own. The bloc also promotes education and student mobility as part of its EU Youth Strategy.In addition to that the Erasmus+ programme offers opportunities for teaching staff to teach in higher education institutions abroad, for example by providing financial support to fund their mobility.PISA results show decline in educational performance in EuropeIn December 2023, the OECD released its latest major PISA survey which assessed the academic performance of 15- to 16-year-old students in 81 countries. The survey, conducted in 2022, showed a decline in competences and basic skills such as mathematics, reading and science in the OECD member states. This was also the case for most EU countries.â€œCompared to 2018, mean performance fell by ten score points in reading and by almost 15 score points in mathematics, which is equivalent to three-quarters of a yearâ€™s worth of learning,â€ the study said. â€œThe decline in mathematics performance is three times greater than any previous consecutive change,â€ the report added. The PISA survey has been carried out every three years since the year 2000. This was the first report since the Covid-19 pandemic, during which many schools were closed and the acquisition of skills was negatively affected.The 2022 study pointed out that only very few OECD countries were able to improve parts of their results between 2018 – when the previous survey was conducted – and 2022. For example Japan in reading and science and Italy, Ireland and Latvia in science. According to the OECD, the decline was particularly visible in a handful of countries. Poland, Norway, Iceland and Germany recorded a decline of 25 or more points in maths between 2018 and 2022.In Spain, the scores in mathematics (473), reading (474) and science (485), were below the average of the OECD countries, which registered a result of 480, 482 and 491 respectively.Following these results, the Spanish government announced an educational reinforcement plan that aims to improve the training of all primary and secondary mathematics teachers – some 80,000 – within three years and ensure that the percentage of 15-year-old students with low performance in reading comprehension, mathematics and science is less than 15 percent in 2030.In Bulgaria, studentsâ€™ results in the 2022 study also remained poor. A total of 54 percent of Bulgarian students failed to meet the baseline standard for maths. Education and Science Minister Galin Tsokov said that targeted efforts will be made in the coming years to ensure that Bulgarian students can utilise the skills related to the knowledge they have acquired. Staff shortages persistAmid ongoing efforts to enhance the quality and performance of education, schools are facing another significant challenge: an escalating shortage of teachers and staff, raising concerns about the growing pressure on teachers and the potential impact on millions of students.In Slovenia for example, more than 3,200 job openings for education professionals were recorded at the countryâ€™s Employment Service in July, with primary school teachers and preschool educators being professions most in demand. According to the Slovenian Education Ministry, the most severe shortages of teachers are in mathematics, physics, chemistry, computer science, and technology.The head of the Trade Union of Education, Science and Culture of Slovenia (SVIZ), Branimir Å trukelj, has called for immediate and comprehensive measures to be taken. In Bulgaria, the Chairperson of the Union of Managers in the Public Education System, Diyan Stamatov, also warned of a huge shortage of teachers of mathematics and physics. Iliana Ivanova, European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth, noted that in recent years the Bulgarian government has made efforts to make the teaching profession more attractive through higher salaries and better opportunities for young people to get a teacher education. According to a survey by the Allensbach Institute for Demoscopy for the Deutsche Telekom Foundation in Germany, Germans are losing faith in their education system. 80 percent of German residents believe politicians do not sufficiently prioritise education. The most urgent problems in schools include teacher shortages, the high number of cancelled lessons and the curriculumâ€™s relevance for work.In France, three teachersâ€™ unions called for a strike in primary schools on September 10 to denounce the introduction of standardised assessments for younger pupils in key learning areas. According to Guislaine David, general secretary of primary school teachers' union FSU-SNUipp, these assessments â€œhave no effect on student success and they do not concern all areas of educationâ€. She added that â€œteachers are being stripped of their educational freedomâ€.With this strike, French teachers also wish to raise concerns about the poor working conditions in schools – in particular the number of students in classes, which is higher than the European average – and the lack of attractiveness of the teaching profession. This year, there are more than 3,000 vacancies in the public and private teaching sectors.This article is published twice a week.

EU importing more gas from Russia than from US,"Following Russiaâ€™s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, many EU member states reduced or stopped their purchases of Russian natural gas, but a significant amount is still imported into the bloc today.
Brussels (dpa) – For the first time in almost two years, European Union countries imported more natural gas in a single quarter from Russia than from the United States, according to a new study of the energy market by Brussels-based think tank Bruegel.The EU purchased more than 12.7 billion cubic metres of natural gas from Russia and 12.3 billion from the US from April to June this year, the study shows.Compared with the first quarter of 2024, deliveries from Russia fell slightly, but those from the US fell more sharply, the research found.Norway remains the EU's largest gas supplier with 23.9 cubic metres in the second quarter. Russia held this position until it invaded Ukraine in February 2022, after which many EU states cut back on Russian imports.According to the German government's statistics, Germany no longer purchases gas from Russia. However, across the EU, Russia has risen to second place in the list of suppliers, just ahead of the US. The countries of destination were not clear from the data.In Sunday's edition of the German newspaper Welt, Norbert RÃ¶ttgen, a foreign affairs expert for Germany's conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) opposition party, called for an EU-wide import ban on Russian gas. ""The Europeans are supporting Ukraine with billions and at the same time paying billions into Putin's war chest – that is neither responsible, rational nor credible,"" RÃ¶ttgen said.Michael Kruse, energy policy spokesman for Germany's pro-business Free Democratic Party (FDP), a member of the ruling coalition, argued that the EU could ""pay a fixed amount for aid and arms deliveries to Ukraine for every cubic metre of Russian gas imported."" Kruse told the newspaper that â€œthis would allow Putin to pay for the resistance against his barbaric attacks himself."" (1 September)",1
"German airlines point to rising costs, demand fairer competition","According to the European Union's RefuelEU aviation initiative, airlines in the bloc must take steps to increase the use of sustainable fuels. But two German airlines point to rising costs and unfair competition.
Frankfurt (dpa) – German airlines Lufthansa and Condor are facing increasingly unfair competition due to a significant rise in taxes and fees, Condor CEO Peter Gerber said on Monday at a business event at Frankfurt Airport.In the past four years, the cost volume from air traffic control, aviation security checks and air traffic tax has doubled from 3.5 billion euros to 7 billion euros per year, he said.International airlines are increasingly avoiding German airports, leading to a loss of global connections, Gerber said. He noted that the German recovery rate is 82 percent compared to the pre-pandemic year 2019, while most other European countries have seen growth in air traffic beyond that level.Lufthansaâ€™s Chief Human Resources Officer Michael Niggemann voiced his opposition to state mandates for the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), saying that since the system only records departures within the European Union, it creates competitive disadvantages with non-European hubs.From 2025, airlines departing from the EU are required to cover an average of 2 percent of their fuel from SAF, with this to rise to 70 percent by 2050. This so-called RefuelEU aviation initiative – aimed at decreasing CO2 emissions in the aviation sector – is part of the FitFor55 package under the bloc's Green Deal, its cornerstone climate policy.Lufthansa said insufficient SAF production in the future will make it a significant cost factor, and that EU and German state requirements for the use of synthetic, electricity-produced fuels are unattainable.

Gender balance at risk in von der Leyen's next EU Commission,"The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has set the goal of achieving gender balance in the next European Commission. Equal numbers of men and women should hold the top jobs. But national governments are not playing ball.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s plans for gender balance in her new team of commissioners are in danger of failing due to a lack of cooperation from member states. To achieve gender balance in the Commission, von der Leyen asked the EUâ€™s national governments to nominate both a man and a woman candidate until the end of August. The goal of parity is not new – already during her first term of office five years ago, Ursula von der Leyen was guided by it when selecting commissioners. Back then with more success.This time several states ignored von der Leyenâ€™s request. Significantly, more than half of the governments had only proposed one male candidate for the College of Commissioners, explaining this, for example, with their nominations in the past. The final balance reflects that 16 countries have proposed male candidates, ten have proposed women, and only one, Bulgaria, has complied with von der Leyenâ€™s wish and proposed a man and a woman, as the EU Commission President had initially requested. The number of women was bolstered Monday after Romanian media reported that Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had switched his pick from a male candidate to MEP Roxana Minzatu.The College of Commissioners will consist of 27 members, with each member state being represented by a commissioner. If there are no further changes to the nominations, around two thirds of the positions could be held by men. The outgoing college was composed of 15 men and twelve women. EU commissioners conduct the work of around 32,000 employees of the EU Commission and are assigned responsibility for specific policy areas by the president. The EU Commission is responsible for proposing new EU laws and monitoring compliance with the European treaties. The selection of commissioners for the new EU Commission is the last major step in filling top political positions after the European elections in June. â€œOld boysâ€™ clubâ€ lineup for EU CommissionThe European Womenâ€™s Lobby (EWL), an umbrella group working toward gender equality in the bloc, said the situation was indicative of an â€œold boysâ€™ clubâ€ mindset and called it â€œbeyond embarrassingâ€.â€œIf member states truly believe only men are fit for these roles or that there are no qualified women in their countries, theyâ€™re not just out of touch – theyâ€™re delusional,â€ said the groupâ€™s spokesperson, Mirta Baselovic.Lina GÃ¡lvez MuÃ±oz, chair of the European Parliament committee on gender equality, said the numbers suggested a clear lack of â€œpolitical willâ€ from member states that sent a â€œvery bad signal, especially to younger women and girlsâ€.At the root of the situation is a power play between von der Leyen and European capitals that may well back goals like gender parity on paper but, in practice, resist having their hands tied in any way.â€œAs member states, we expect von der Leyen to strive for gender parity,â€ said an EU diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity to the French press agency AFP. â€œAt the same time, we also believe that it is up to us to propose the commissioner we prefer. (...) Unfortunately, those two desires donâ€™t seem to align this time around.â€â€œI believe that this story shows how, unfortunately, gender equality in politics has not yet been assimilated,â€ a source close to the European Commission President told the Italian press agency ANSA.Is there a risk of reputational damage?Italian EU law expert Alberto Alemanno recently warned that a male-dominated college would weaken the authority of the EU Commissionâ€™s President.He called on von der Leyen to make her dissatisfaction clear to the national capitals and ask them to draw up a new list of candidates as quickly as possible in order to limit the damage to her own reputation and that of the EU as a whole.According to Alemanno, this could also lead to weak male commissioner candidates not receiving the necessary approval in the European Parliament. This would mean that the national governments that nominated them would have to appoint a new candidate. Whatâ€™s coming next?With all the names in hand, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen now has to distribute all the portfolios, both in terms of rank (vice-presidencies) and the subjects for which each commissioner will be responsible, with areas such as the economy, industry and defence among the most desired by the candidates. Giving female candidates more important portfolios and vice-presidencies could be a way to compensate for the numerical gender imbalance.Ursula von der Leyen has already made her first choices for her top team. German newspaper Die Welt reported on Tuesday that a right-wing populist, Raffaele Fitto, a member of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's Fratelli d'Italia party, will obtain a top position in the European Commission and is expected to be appointed executive vice-president in charge of the economy and post-pandemic recovery. Franceâ€™s Thierry Breton will take charge of industry and strategic autonomy. Spainâ€™s Teresa Ribera has been chosen for a ""transition"" portfolio that will include ecology and digital affairs. Slovakiaâ€™s MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ will stay on as commissioner for inter-institutional affairs, while Czech industry and trade minister Jozef SÃ­kela will be in charge of energy. Polandâ€™s Piotr Serafin will be responsible for budgetary affairs.The European Parliament has invited von der Leyen to meet with the heads of the political groups and the President of the institution on September 11 to present to them the final distribution of her team. Although it is not clear whether she will make it public before or after that closed-doors-meeting.Between the end of September and the beginning of October, all commissioners must pass individual hearings in the parliamentary committee that deals with their portfolio. It is usual for at least one candidate to fail at this stage, where their conflicts of interest are also reviewed, forcing their country of origin to nominate an alternative candidate.Once all candidates have received the green light from their respective committees, the plenary of the European Parliament votes on the European Commission as a whole, the final step before their new mandate can begin. Although the current Commission is due to conclude its functions on October 31, its work may be extended until the new executive is ready.Commissioners nominated by the member states:Women:Belgium: Hadja Lahbib (Renew)Bulgaria: Ekaterina Zaharieva (EPP)Croatia: Dubravka Å uica (EPP)Germany: Ursula von der Leyen (EPP, President)Estonia: Kaja Kallas (Renew, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy)Finland: Henna Virkkunen (EPP)Portugal: Maria LuÃ­s Albuquerque (EPP)Romania: Roxana Minzatu (S&D)Sweden: Jessika Roswall (EPP)Spain: Teresa Ribera (S&D)Men:Bulgaria: Julian Popov (Renew)Denmark: Dan JÃ¸rgensen (S&D)France: Thierry Breton (Renew)Greece: Apostolos Tzitzikostas (EPP)Ireland: Michael McGrath (Renew)Italy: Raffaele Fitto (EKR)Latvia: Valdis Dombrovskis (EPP)Lithuania: Andrius Kubilius (EPP)Luxembourg: Christophe Hansen (EPP)Malta: Glenn Micallef (S&D)Netherlands: Wopke Hoekstra (EPP)Austria: Magnus Brunner (EPP)Poland: Piotr Serafin (EPP)Slovakia: MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (S&D)Slovenia: TomaÅ¾ Vesel (non-party)Czech Republic: Jozef SÃ­kela (EPP)Hungary: OlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi (Patriots)Cyprus: Costas Kadis (non-party)This article is published twice a week.

EU Commission urged to target EU agriculture subsidies at poorer farmers,"A report by a committee of experts has advised the European Commission to target Common Agricultural Policy subsidies to poorer farmers. Earlier this year, farmers staged angry protests against EU agricultural policy.Brussels (dpa) – A report released on Wednesday urges the European Commission to shake up the European Union's agricultural subsidies to better support poorer farmers, aiming to address the concerns that sparked the widespread protests by furious farmers in recent months.""Bold and swift action at all levels is needed"" to address multiple agricultural and environmental crises, said the report, written by an expert committee and presented to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels.The report advises targeting subsidies from the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) fund towards ""farmers who need it most"" based on income and away from payouts based on the size of land held.The wide-ranging consultations involving agricultural bodies and environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were launched by von der Leyen in the wake of angry farmers' protests across the EU earlier this year. Farmers were particularly displeased with increased bureaucracy and falling incomes.The report is meant to inform agricultural policy in the new Commission for the next five years. Other recommendations include a specific loan package for the agricultural sector from the European Investment Bank (EIB).The report also advised a rethink of the bloc's trade negotiation strategy to account for the ""strategic relevance of agriculture and food products"" and a review of impact assessments of trade deals.The Commission should also establish a platform for further consultations among stakeholders from agricultural and environmental groups, the report said.

Workshop on artificial intelligence with dpa: how to recognise and use AI in journalism,"On September 3, the European Newsroom hosted an online workshop on artificial intelligence, facilitated by dpa. Participants learned about how to use AI tools in their work as (news agency) journalists, as well as how to recognise AI-generated content, such as deepfakes.How can journalists use tools powered by artificial intelligence (AI) in their daily work? What should they be careful about when doing so and what should they not use AI for? And how can they more easily recognise AI-generated content online, such as deepfakes, and debunk them?These were some of the questions addressed in a workshop organised by the European Newsroom (enr). The workshop was facilitated by Stefan Voss, head of verification at the German Press Agency (dpa) and Patrick Neumann, head of dpa-academy and recruitment officer.Artificial intelligence is a hot topic around the world, and its use – in both personal and professional settings – is growing. AI-powered tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT are developing rapidly.In addition, the issue of fake news and false content is high on the political agenda – both in the European Union and beyond – with politicians and experts alike warning of the potential impact on society and consumers of online content.Around 30 journalists and media professionals from agencies participating the enr attended the workshop, including from AFP (France), Agerpres (Romania), ANP (the Netherlands), ANSA (Italy), BTA (Bulgaria), dpa (Germany), EFE (Spain), FENA (Bosnia and Herzegovina), MIA (North Macedonia), STA (Slovenia), Tanjug (Serbia) and TT (Sweden).Throughout the workshop, the facilitators and participants engaged in lively discussions on AI in journalism. Participants were given a hands-on introduction to use some AI-powered tools, such as ChatGPT, in their work as journalists. They were also shown several examples of AI-generated content and deepfakes, and taught how to spot and debunk them.",1
"EU post pandemic recovery fund too slow in reaching member states, auditors find","The European Court of Auditors on Monday released a new report evaluating the performance of the blocâ€™s major post COVID-19 recovery fund, intended to support member statesâ€™ economies to build back better. The verdict: Funds donâ€™t reach countries fast enough, putting its objectives and goals at risk. Money from a flagship fund to support the European Unionâ€™s economic recovery in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic is at risk of not reaching EU countries fast enough, the Luxembourg-based European Court of Auditors (ECA) warned on Monday.Halfway through the COVID-19 relief fundâ€™s lifespan, â€œEU countries had drawn down less than a third of the planned fundsâ€, Ivana MaletiÄ‡, a lead auditor of the review, warned in a statement.The EUâ€™s top budget and policy watchdog said the slow speed is jeopardising the fundâ€™s objectives. She highlighted the â€œrisks of funding absorption slowing further and projects not being completedâ€. The European Court of Auditors (ECA) blamed inflation and material shortages linked to the war in Ukraine, planning delays for large infrastructure projects, national bureaucracy like public procurement rules, and changes of government for the delays in using the funds.The ECA is responsible for keeping an eye on – and improving – the EUâ€™s financial management by checking that funds are collected and utilised accordingly.https://twitter.com/EUauditors/status/1830916146020639151What is the recovery fund and how can countries access it? The EUâ€™s Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), worth 724 billion Euro originally, launched in February 2021 and runs until August 2026, is the main component of the NextGenerationEU instrument designed to aid member states after the pandemic.The bloc agreed on the unprecedented mechanism in July 2020 after bitter negotiations in the face of opposition from frugal countries led by The Netherlands.The countries, mainly in northern Europe, feared having to foot the bill for higher spending in their southern neighbours. Italy and Spain are some of the main beneficiaries of the funds.By the end of 2023, the European Commission, which is responsible for managing the funds, had only transferred 213 billion Euro to member states. To finance the RRF, the Commission borrows on capital markets and makes the funds available to member states to finance projects as well as environmental and digital reforms subject to conditions.The EU countries receive part of the money as grants that do not have to be repaid, and the rest as loans. This is the first time that debts have been jointly incurred on a large scale in the EU. The debts are to be settled by the end of 2058 at the latest.In order to receive the aid, member states must submit a plan with specific investment and reform projects – their national Recovery and Resilience Plans (RRPs). The funds are performance-based and only to be paid once agreed milestones and targets for the implementation of the planned reforms and investments have been achieved.According to the ECA, almost all countries had submitted their payment applications to the commission with delays. The reasons for this were often uncertainties regarding environmental regulations and insufficient administrative capacity. The time required to implement measures was also underestimated.The new ECA audit found that while the rate of payments from the Commission is progressing, EU countries may not be able to â€œabsorb the funds in timeâ€ for their public projects before the fund expires in 2026.In addition to the risk that some of the money will not be utilised in the end, there is also the risk that the Commission will transfer a lot of money to the EU countries without the promised projects and reforms being implemented in the end. This is due to the fact that a member state does not only receive money when a project is completed, but also when certain interim targets are reached. The EU executive has no legal means of reclaiming this part of the funds if the country does not complete the project or does not finalise the project by August 2026, the ECA warns in its report.What is the situation in member states?By the end of last year, EU countries â€œmade less than 30 % progress towards reaching their pre-defined milestones and targetsâ€ according to the auditors.The total number of milestones and targets stands at 2159 of which 679 had been satisfactorily fulfilled at the end of 2023, according to the report.Auditors also found that half of the funds disbursed to 15 EU member states did not reach the final recipients of the public money and that seven EU countries did not ""provide complete and consistent information on the current location of these funds.""The ECA warns of the risk that applications for European money from the recovery fund will be further delayed and projects will not be completed on time. As a result, member states â€˜cannot enjoy the expected economic and social benefitsâ€™, the Court says.While 16 member states plan to complete targets and milestones relating to at least 30 percent of their investments in 2026 only, Italy plans to finalise 62 percent of planned investments by 2026. The country had fulfilled 178 out of 525 milestones and targets by the end of 2023, including for example increasing the administrative capacity of local authorities, having applied to 46 percent of the funding available to the country. By the end of 2023, Austria had only applied for 23 percent of the funds earmarked for the country and had only fulfilled 44 of the 171 milestones and targets. Austria had received a tranche totalling 700 million Euro until the end of 2023. Over the entire term, the country is entitled to around 3.5 billion Euro.The Netherlands only submitted an initial 1.3 billion Euro application in May this year, a spokesman for the ECA said. The Dutch government plans to spend that first amount on investments in healthcare, education, building affordable housing and digitalisation. Over 5.4 billion Euro is available for the country in total.In Germany, the money will be used to speed up planning and approval procedures in the transport sector and drive forward the digitalisation of administration, among other things. According to the latest information, Germany will be able to call up a total of 30.3 billion Euro in non-repayable grants.Slovenia has completed, is implementing or is about to start implementing more than 1,000 projects. According to the Slovenian Recovery and Resilience Office, the country has so far received 841 million Euro in payments, of which 310 million Euro were loans. It has 1.61 billion Euro of grants available until the end of 2026 and can also benefit from 1.07 billion Euro of loans.The state has so far disbursed around 500 million Euro, mainly for projects to provide public rental housing, increase the capacity of rail infrastructure, improve water supply, educational and health infrastructure. After the catastrophic floods in August 2023, Brussels approved amendments to Sloveniaâ€™s RRP that put even more emphasis on the Green Deal. Slovenia has so far completed 15 of the 36 reform measures required to qualify for funding.EUâ€™s public prosecutors investigate fraud related to post-pandemic recovery fundEarlier this year, in April, financial police in Italy, Austria, Romania and Slovakia arrested 22 people and seized around 600 million Euro in connection with a European Public Prosecutorâ€™s Office (EPPO) investigation of criminal organisations trying to defraud the EU.The suspects allegedly have used a network of fictitious companies to apply for money from the EU-funded Next Generation EU recovery programme and then embezzled it, the EPPO said. The crimes took place between 2021 and 2023, the office alleged.Specifically, the alleged criminal organisation was concerned with funds from the Italian National Recovery Programme. Using fictitious companies and with the involvement of front men, the suspects applied for large sums of money for various project initiatives, according to the police statement.As a particularly hard-hit country, Italy is to receive the largest sum from the EUâ€™s recovery programme at almost 200 billion Euro.This article is published twice a week.

Draghi: EU needs economic makeover to boost competitiveness,"Mario Draghi, Italian economist and special advisor to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, has presented his long-awaited report on European competitiveness.Brussels (dpa) – Former Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi has called on the European Union to develop a ""new industrial strategy"" to revive the bloc's flagging competitiveness to achieve economic growth.Draghi described the EU as being ""stuck in a static industrial structure"" compared to the United States and China, and called for more investments in research and innovation, clean energy technologies and faster regulatory decision-making.Over a year ago, with EU countries fretting increasingly about the economy, the European Commission tasked Draghi with drafting a plan to reverse the bloc's economic fortunes. The Italian has been the Prime Minister of Italy from 2021 to 2022 and President of the European Central Bank from 2011 to 2019.To achieve new economic growth, the EU needs investment worth 750-800 billion euros annually, Draghi said, the equivalent of 4.4-4.7 percent of the EU's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023.To show the scale of the investment and challenge required, Draghi made reference to the United States' Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II.

Germany to bring back checks at all borders amid migration debate,"German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has ordered passport controls to be resumed along all German land borders in a bid to sharply curb the number of people entering the country without visas.Berlin (dpa) - The checks at all German land borders will go into effect on September 16 and are initially expected to remain in place for six months, sources said. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser has informed the European Commission of the plans, according to dpa sources.The border checks are intended both to limit irregular migration as well as address threats from Islamist terrorist groups and cross-border criminal organizations, according to the sources.Long-standing debates over how to handle migrants seeking asylum in Germany have intensified in recent weeks after a deadly knife attack earlier this month in the western German city of Solingen.The suspected attacker, a Syrian citizen, had evaded an order to be deported from Germany to Bulgaria, where he first entered the European Union.All of Germany's neighbours are fellow members of the Schengen Zone, which is normally supposed to allow control-free travel across all countries within its area of free movement.In October 2023, Germany has already resumed some border controls along its frontiers with Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Poland to deter the movement of migrants into Germany.Those border checks are officially on a temporary basis but have been repeatedly extended by the German federal government. Similar controls on the border with Austria have been temporarily in place since September 2015. (10 September)",1
European schools crack down on mobile phone use over health concerns,"Many schools across Europe are introducing bans or restrictions on the use of mobile phones amid concerns about their impact on young peopleâ€™s mental health. While there are no EU-wide rules to tackle the issue, in July EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen also sounded the alarm and vowed to take action.As digital technology becomes an ever-present force in young peopleâ€™s lives, European countries are increasingly raising concerns about the excessive use of mobile phones, social media and other forms of digital communication – with some moving towards banning or restricting mobile phones in schools.Recent studies have highlighted alarming links between excessive screen time and the consequent negative impact on the mental health and academic performance of children and young people. For example, a study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) advised limited and responsible use of mobile phones in schools.In July, upon her re-election as European Commission President for a second term, Ursula von der Leyen vowed to tackle social media addiction and cyberbullying, referring to widespread concerns about the negative impact on mental health and well-being.â€œWe see more and more reporting on what some call a mental health crisis,â€ von der Leyen said. â€œWe will convene the first-ever European-wide enquiry on the impact of social media on the wellbeing of young people. We owe it to them,â€ she added.On cyberbullying, von der Leyen said: â€œMy heart bleeds when I read about young people harming themselves or even taking their lives because of online abuse.â€ She vowed to â€œtackle the plague of cyberbullyingâ€ and to â€œtake action against the addictive design of some platformsâ€.Keeping mobile devices out of sightWhile the European Union has been increasingly aware of the negative effects of social media and mobile phone use among young people, there are no EU-wide rules to tackle these issues across all of the blocâ€™s 27 member states. Instead, rules vary by country.Some European countries are considering or have already introduced bans on mobile phones in schools or restrictions on their use during school hours. These include Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Greece. Other countries, such as Slovenia, Croatia and EU membership candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina are exploring options to address the concerns, but have not yet introduced nationwide bans. Instead, schools are taking matters into their own hands.The Netherlands: Schools in the Netherlands enacted a complete nationwide ban on mobile phones as of the first week of September. Phones in secondary school classrooms have been forbidden since the beginning of the year, a measure that has now been extended to primary schools from the start of the new school year.Phones may still be used in class if they are necessary for the content of the lesson, for example when learning about media skills, or if pupils are dependent on them for medical reasons or due to a disability.France: At 180 â€œcollegesâ€, the middle schools French children attend between the ages of eleven and 15, a scheme is being trialled to ban the use of mobile phones during the entire school day. The trial of the so-called â€œdigital pauseâ€, which encompasses more than 50,000 pupils, is being implemented ahead of a possible plan to enforce it nationwide from 2025.Right now, pupils in French middle schools must turn off their phones. The experiment takes things further, requiring children to hand in their phones on arrival. It is part of a move by President Emmanuel Macron for children to spend less time in front of screens, which the government fears is arresting their development.A report on young peopleâ€™s use of screens presented to Macron in April by a commission of experts recommended no phones until the age of 11, giving children between 11 and 13 years old a so-called â€œdumb phoneâ€ without internet and restricting internet access until the age of 15. Such a â€œdumbphoneâ€ device, called â€œThe Phoneâ€ is now being developed in France by an entrepreneur mother, her son and a partner.Belgium: In Belgium, mobile phones will be banned in classrooms of hundreds of French-speaking schools in Brussels and Wallonia starting this school year. The plans were announced by the francophone regionâ€™s new government over the summer.Â In the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, however, there is no general ban on phones in schools, but some have decided to introduce prohibitions on their own.Greece: In Greece, students are required to keep their mobile phones in their school bags at all times during lessons. The Minister of Education, Kyriakos Pierrakakis, clarified that clearly visible possession and use of mobile phones is prohibited even during breaks and a violation would lead to a one-day suspension.Last week, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis did not rule out the possibility that students would be forced to lock their mobile phones away and collect them after school hours.Â Italy: In Italy, mobile phones are banned from classrooms starting this school year, under a decree issued by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloniâ€™s right-wing administration in July. The measure was introduced by Education Minister Giuseppe Valditara from the nationalist League party and aims to prohibit the use of mobile phones in schools, including for teaching purposes. Tablets and computers can still be used with teachersâ€™ consent.Â Spain: In several regions in Spain, bans and restrictions on mobile phones in school have already been in place, such as the Communities of Madrid, Galicia, Castilla-La Mancha, Andalusia and Extremadura.Â In January, the State School Council of Spain – the highest consultative body of the government in the educational field – unanimously approved a veto on the use of mobile phones in primary education and limitations for secondary education. Consequently, other regions began to implement measures. In Aragon, the Valencian Community, the Balearic Islands and Navarre as well as Andalusia, for example, teachers have the power to confiscate and turn off students' phones until the end of the school day.Sweden: Swedenâ€™s Public Health Agency (FHM) has recently issued recommendations on screen time for children. It said children under the age of two should be kept away from digital media and television completely and it should be limited for more senior ages.The new recommendations are based on research and how much time the kids should spend on different things to feel well. According to Swedish government figures, teenagers between 13 and 16 in Sweden in general spend 6.5 hours a day online. Swedenâ€™s Minister of Social Affairs and Public Health, Jakob Forssmed, hopes that the tech companies will act in order to reduce the risk for kids to get stuck online.Slovenia: In Slovenian primary and secondary schools, it is up to each individual school to restrict the use of mobile devices. Internal rules vary from school to school, but few have banned the use of mobile devices completely. According to experts, a first step towards reducing screen use would be to set national guidelines.Â Online violence among young people is on the rise, according to this yearâ€™s survey by Safe.si, the national awareness-raising point for safe internet use. In Slovenia, as many as 65 percent of primary school girls and 55 percent of primary school boys have experienced some form of online violence. In secondary school, 63 percent of female students and 54 percent of male students have experienced some form of online violence.Croatia: In Croatia, there are no uniform rules and the Ministry of Education has not yet made any decision on this matter. However, some schools have already made a decision to prohibit the use of mobile phones by students the entire time they are at school, including during breaks between individual lessons.Â These include schools in several Croatian cities: Zagreb, Split, Rijeka, Osijek, Zadar. One school in Split also introduced a ban on bringing mobile phones to school, claiming that a simple ban of using it is not enough. Bosnia and Herzegovina: To encourage greater socialisation among students and prevent juvenile delinquency, several schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina have banned bringing mobile phones to class. However, despite a parliamentary initiative to extend this practice, it has not yet been implemented in most educational institutions across the country.According to a study by UNICEF and the Communications Regulatory Agency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, every second child in Bosnia and Herzegovina under the age of eleven has a profile on a social media platform. More than 50 percent of children have experienced unpleasantness online, yet over 85 percent have not discussed it with anyone.This article is published twice a week.

"Top EU court confirms multibillion-euro payments for Apple, Google","The European Union's highest court ordered Apple and Google to pay billions back in taxes and a competition fine respectively, ending long-running legal battles. The two cases were part of EU's fight to stop tax loopholes and rein in US tech giants.Luxembourg (dpa) - The European Court of Justice (ECJ) backed on Tuesday a European Commission ruling that Apple must pay 13 billion euro (14.4 billion dollars) back in taxes, annulling a previous ruling in Apple's favour.In 2016, the European Commission ordered the multi-billion euro tax payment, arguing that the US company had underpaid taxes due in the bloc following a suspected sweetheart deal with EU member Ireland.Apple filed a successful complaint with the EU's general court, arguing that the Commission had failed to prove that the contested tax deal constituted prohibited state aid.The general court had sided with Apple, prompting the Commission to call on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) to make a final ruling in the case.The ECJ decided on Tuesday that the Commission was right and in a statement on the ruling said that ""Ireland granted Apple unlawful aid which Ireland is required to recover.""In a separate case, the ECJ confirmed a fine worth 2.4 billion euro (2.7 billion dollars) for Google for breaching EU competition rules with its price comparison service Google Shopping.The Commission first imposed the fine in 2017, arguing the search engine operator favoured its own price comparison service, Google Shopping, over those of its competitors, and therefore abused its market power.Google had logged an unsuccessful complaint with the EU's general court in 2020 and had then appealed to the bloc's highest jurisdiction.The search engine operator had argued that treating competitors differently is inherent in competition and innovation, not an antitrust violation.The ECJ's ruling confirming the penalty is final and cannot be challenged.

French candidate for next European Commission Thierry Breton resigns,"Thierry Breton's resignation from the European Commission comes as a surprise as President Ursula von der Leyen is due to present her team of Commissioners for the next term to the European Parliament on Tuesday.Brussels (dpa) – The French candidate for the next European Commission and current EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton resigned in a surprise move on Monday by posting a letter on social media platform X.In his letter, Breton claimed that European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen asked France to nominate another person in exchange for ""an allegedly more influential portfolio for France"" in the Commission.Breton, who is the incumbent French Commissioner, said this ""political trade-off"" with France was made ""for personal reasons that in no instance you have discussed directly with me.""The French candidate, who publicly criticised von der Leyen's leadership during the European Parliament elections in June, said this was ""further testimony to questionable governance"" in the Commission.The resignation comes as von der Leyen is preparing to unveil her new leadership team to the European Parliament on Tuesday.The process has already been delayed as von der Leyen wrangles with EU countries over policy portfolios, trying to balance geographic and political factors.Complicating matters further is von der Leyen's request for EU member states to nominate a man and a woman for the Commission roles in pursuit of gender parity among her European Commissioners. Most EU member states defied that request. (16 September)",1
"Von der Leyen: New EU Commission to focus more on economy, security","European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has today presented her team of Commissioners to the European Parliament in Strasbourg.Strasbourg (dpa) – The new European Commission line-up is to focus on the issues of competitiveness and security, shifting away from tackling the climate crisis as the top priority.""Last time, the topic of global warming was absolutely top,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen as she presented her team of commissioner nominees at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.""The dominance of the topic is still there,"" she added, mentioning recent devastating floods and wildfires. ""But this time, for example, the topic of security triggered by the Russian war in Ukraine, but also the topic of competitiveness has much more impact"" on the organisation of her team, von der Leyen said.For the first time, the European Commission will have a Commissioner specifically responsible for defence issues. In her team presentation, von der Leyen proposed former Lithuanian Prime Minister and former MEP Andrius Kubilius as Commissioner for Defence and Space.The current Dutch Commissioner for Climate Action, Wopke Hoekstra, was put forward for the post of Commissioner for Climate, Net-Zero and Clean Growth. Swedenâ€™s former Minister for EU Affairs, Jessika Roswall, was proposed as Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular Economy.The College of Commissioners of the European Commission will have 27 members – one for each EU member state. This includes President von der Leyen. In order to be approved for office, the Commissioners-designate will have to undergo individual hearings in the European Parliament. (17 September)",1
"Draghi's EU competitiveness report: Invest or lose, but can the EU pull it off?","Last week, the long anticipated report of former Italian Prime Minister and former European Central Bank boss Mario Draghi dropped â€“ including some 170 proposals on how to boost the blocâ€™s competitiveness. What does it entail and what are the reactions?Mario Draghiâ€™s report takes a stern look at the status quo of the European Unionâ€™s economy, calling for more investment and faster decision-making.The former Italian prime minister acknowledged the ambition of his proposals which would represent a bigger boost than the post-World War II Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe, arguing that it was justified by an â€œexistential challengeâ€ facing the bloc.The blueprint for competitiveness, based around some 170 proposals, recommends a yearly investment of 750 to 800 billion Euro, joint debts and reforms to combat lagging behind competitors such as the USA and China.He stated thatÂ  â€œthe only way to become more productive is for Europe to radically changeâ€ but concerns about feasibility, funding and the impact on the blocâ€™s competitive future remain.Â European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who in July secured a second five-year term at the helm of the blocâ€™s executive arm, hopes to use the 400-page report to shape the priorities of her cabinet. She had commissioned the report last year. First discussions on the report will follow in October, said Croatian Prime Minister Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡.What does Draghi want?Â Draghi called for more investments in research and innovation, clean energy technologies, and faster regulatory decision-making and â€œa new industrial strategy for Europeâ€.â€œWe have reached the point where, without action, we will have to either compromise our welfare, our environment or our freedom,â€ he said in a press conference in Brussels. â€œIt's going to be a slow agony.â€Â European Central Bank (ECB) chief Christine Lagarde said the report was â€œsevereâ€ but â€œjustâ€, adding that the proposals in the report could help the ECB â€œachieve better results in our monetary policyâ€.â€œMario Draghiâ€™s report on European competitiveness is logical and takes a good look at the global situation,â€ Croatian premier Andrej PlenkoviÄ‡ said. Productive tech: Draghi, a former president of the ECB, wants the bloc to close its innovation gap with the United States, highlighting the major advantage Washington holds in the high-tech sector.In the US economy, â€œmost of the productivity is concentrated in the high-tech sectorâ€, Draghi said, noting that when tech is removed for comparison, the EUâ€™s economic productivity has performed better.Draghi wants the EU to reduce regulations and ease compliance for tech entrepreneurs, especially smaller enterprises, as well as to boost financing options for companies to expand.Decarbonisation versus growth: The EU must also use its status as a â€œworld leader in clean technologiesâ€ like wind turbines to achieve new growth through policies to reduce carbon emissions, Draghi said.He warned in his report, however, that if policy is not coordinated correctly, then â€œdecarbonization could run contrary to competitiveness and growthâ€.The former Italian premier also warned of an overreliance on China and that â€œChinaâ€™s state-sponsored competitionâ€ is also a threat to the EUâ€™s clean technology and automotive industries.According to Draghi, â€œemulating the US approach of systematically shutting out Chinese technologyâ€ would set back the EUâ€™s transition away from fossil fuels and impose higher costs on the economy.Foreign economic policy: Drawing comparisons with the US and China, Draghi called on the bloc to develop a â€œforeign economic policyâ€ to craft more preferential trade agreements, build stockpiles of strategic raw materials, and secure supply chains of critical technologies.Draghi pointed out that â€œunlike fossil fuels, the EU has deposits of some essential raw materialsâ€, highlighting the case of lithium in Portugal, which can be used for electric vehicles, wind turbines and other goods.However, at the moment, â€œthe EU continues to rely heavily on imports of raw materials instead of exploiting domestic resourcesâ€, he criticised.  Lithium is an essential part of the lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles, demand for which has increased rapidly in recent years and is expected to reach more than 30 percent of annual vehicle sales by 2030.Portugal is known as the largest and, in fact, the only significant lithium production site in the EU, but such exploitation is not without controversy. Geologists warn of the environmental impacts.More broadly, Draghi called for greater joint procurement in defence, easing competition rules in the telecoms market to allow more consolidation and deepening capital markets to boost investments.The money questionTo achieve new economic growth, the EU needs to invest the equivalent of 4.4 to 4.7 percent of the EUâ€™s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2023, between 750 to 800 billion Euro annually.Investments should be partly financed by the European Union through joint borrowing modelled after its historic NextGenerationEU instrument designed for recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, said Draghi. The EU resorted to joint borrowing for an 800-billion-Euro fund to support member statesâ€™ economies hit hard by the pandemic, but the concept remains controversial.Draghi said the bloc should issue new â€œcommon debt instruments... to finance joint investment projects that will increase the EUâ€™s competitiveness and securityâ€.Among the ideaâ€™s biggest supporters are France and Italy, but other countries including Germany and the Netherlands oppose such action, fearing they will be forced to contribute disproportionately to other member states.German Finance Minister Christian Lindner was quick to reject the idea. â€œJoint borrowing by the EU will not solve the structural problems,â€ he said.Aware of the opposition to his proposal, Draghi said common loans would be possible only if â€œthe political and institutional conditions are metâ€.Belgian MEP Bruno Tobback, a member of the Industry committee in the European Parliament, said there is a need for new public money to pay for the transition. â€œIf the member states lend together, they minimise their risks, they are being offered more financial breathing space and they receive a big stimulus for their economy,â€ Tobback said.However, many economists and policy experts agree that despite the reportâ€™s ambitious goals, implementation may fall short. If the EU wants to reduce its dependence on China and catch up with the US then â€œ27 different industrial strategies won't do the jobâ€, Neil Makaroff, a director with Strategic Perspectives, a European climate think tank said in a statement.The European Parliamentâ€™s budget committee president and former Belgian finance minister Johan Van Overtveldt pointed to the fact that the issuance of â€œcommon safe assetsâ€ as Draghi calls them is typical for a fully-fledged state, but that the EU is not quite there yet. He said fresh money can be found by cutting back on some expenditures and by increasing member statesâ€™ direct contributions to the EU budget. Van Overtveldt is also eyeing the completion of the Capital Markets Union, as it can guarantee ""a big return on investment"", so he claims.Marko JakliÄ, a professor at the Faculty of Economics at the University of Ljubljana, argued in a similar fashion: â€œI am quite sceptical, there are certainly economic reasons for joint investment and also financing, but I am not sure that the political maturity is there yet. I will be positively surprised if the new European Commission shows that it is capable of convincing member states.â€â€œThe report is not an ideal recipe for every country, but it is a pretty good recipe for encouraging the development of European multinationals,â€ said Bojan Ivanc, chief economist at the Slovenian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.This article is published twice a week.

European Commission calls for more smoke-free zones to fight cancer,"Citing the high number of smoking-related cancer deaths, the European Commission wants to see more smoke-free zones where children and young people gather outdoors.Brussels (dpa) – The European Commission on Tuesday called for more smoke-free areas to protect people from second-hand smoke and to reduce cancer deaths.""Every year in the EU, 700,000 persons lose their lives due to tobacco consumption, among which tens of thousands are due to second-hand smoke,"" said European Union Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides.""We have a duty to protect our citizens, in particular children and young people, against exposure to harmful smoke and emissions,"" she added.According to a press release,the Commission wants to see more smoke-free zones established where children and young people gather outdoors, like playgrounds, amusement parks and public swimming pools.In addition to traditional cigarettes, the Commission recommends that heated tobacco products and electronic cigarettes be covered by tobacco-use policies.However, health policy is a competence of EU member states, meaning that the Commission can only come up with recommendations rather than with binding legislation.According to EU figures, a quarter of deaths caused by cancer in the EU, Iceland and Norway can be attributed to smoking, making tobacco the leading cancer risk.

Europe's next chapter: Von der Leyen's Commission team unveiled for new term,"Ursula von der Leyen presented her candidates for the future EU Commission. Many women are in top jobs, but she did not meet her gender parity target.After weeks of speculation and backdoor negotiations, on Tuesday the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, presented her team of European commissioners. The next step in the commissioners' approval process are hearings of the Commissioners-designate in the European Parliament.The work of the new EU Commission (2024-2029) will primarily focus on security and competitiveness rather than climate protection. On the staff front, the appointment of the right-wing populist Raffaele Fitto, a member of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloniâ€™s Fratelli dâ€™Italia party, as one of the vice-presidents of the EU Commission remains particularly contentious.Five years ago, the focus was clear: â€œLast time, the issue of global warming was absolutely top,â€ said von der Leyen, and that the topic was still dominant with regard to forest fires and floods. â€But this time, for example, the topic of security, triggered by the Russian war in Ukraine, but also the topic of competitiveness, has much more influenceâ€ on the organisation of her team, von der Leyen said. The new team should work in a â€œmore fluid, more intertwinedâ€ way so that everything contributes to broad objectives of â€œprosperity, security and democracyâ€.The new strategy is also reflected in the newly created post of Defense Commissioner. It is to be filled by Lithuaniaâ€™s former Prime Minister Andrius Kubilius – and therefore someone from a country that borders Russia. â€œHe will work to develop the European Defence Union and strengthen our investments and industrial capacities,â€ emphasised von der Leyen.For weeks, speculations have been doing the rounds on social media and behind closed doors as to who would take on which position. Von der Leyen has filled many of the top jobs in her new Commission team with women. She gave attractive portfolios to countries that respected her request to replace their male candidates with women, such as the Enlargement portfolio to Slovenian Marta Kos or an Executive Vice-Presidency position to Romanian Roxana Minzatu.Additionally, four of the six top roles of other Executive Vice-Presidents will be taken over by women – Spainâ€™s Teresa Ribera, Finlandâ€™s Henna Virkkunen, Estoniaâ€™s Kaja Kallas and Romaniaâ€™s Roxana MÃ®nzatu. The remaining two posts will be filled by men – Franceâ€˜s StÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© and controversial Italian Raffaele Fitto.Despite the efforts, von der Leyen has failed to achieve her goal of gender parity. She explained that 40 percent of the new Commission would be women and 60 percent men. According to von der Leyen, the heads of state and government had originally proposed almost 80 percent men. â€œThat was completely unacceptable,â€ von der Leyen said.The EU Commission, a legislative body with around 32,000 employees, proposes laws for the Union and monitors compliance with EU law. The College of Commissioners –  consisting of 27 members from 27 EU member states – coordinates the work of the whole EU Commission. Fittoâ€™s appointment criticised One name among the Commissioner candidates raised eyebrows even before the presentation. Italianâ€™s right-wing populist Raffaele Fitto, minister for Europe in the government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, should now become one of the Executive Vice-Presidents and Commissioner for Cohesion and Reforms. This would make him responsible for the European Social Fund and a fund for regional development, among others.â€œRaffaele Fitto will be responsible for the portfolio dealing with cohesion policy, regional development and cities,â€ von der Leyen said during the press conference on Tuesday. â€œWe will draw on his extensive experience to help modernise and strengthen our cohesion, investment and growth policies,â€ von der Leyen added. â€œItaly is a very important country and this must also be reflected in our choice,â€ the President of the EU Commission stressed. Raffaele Fitto said he felt honoured after Ursula von der Leyen appointed him to her new team of Commissioners on Tuesday. â€œI intend to exercise the role entrusted to me, once the process of approving the new Commission is complete, with the utmost commitment and in full compliance with the Treaties and their spirit, in the knowledge that the next five years will be crucial for the future of the EU and its citizens.â€Meanwhile the liberal Renew group on Tuesday expressed dissatisfaction at the decision to nominate Fitto. â€œI deplore von der Leyenâ€™s political decision to give an executive vice-presidency to Raffaele Fitto,â€ said Renew President ValÃ©rie Hayer. Renew would wait for the presentation hearings in the European Parliament. â€œWe will evaluate him on his skills, on his pro-European commitments, on his independence and on his coherence with the July guidelines – there will be maximum vigilance from us,â€ she said. â€œThe pro-EU forces must unite: We must not leave room for populists of the right and left.â€ The Greens also said they would â€œnot give Raffaele Fitto an easy rideâ€ in the European Parliament. â€œThe fact that a candidate from a far-right government is nominated as Vice-President of the European Commission remains a big concern for our Groupâ€, Greens Co-president Terry Reintke said. Commissioners-designate:Teresa Ribera RodrÃ­guez (Spain) - Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive TransitionHenna Virkkunen (Finland) - Executive Vice-President for Tech Sovereignty, Security and DemocracyStÃ©phane SÃ©journÃ© (France) - Executive Vice-President for Prosperity and Industrial StrategyKaja Kallas (Estonia) - High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and Vice-President of the European CommissionRoxana MÃ®nzatu (Romania) - Executive Vice-President for People, Skills and PreparednessRaffaele Fitto (Italy) - Executive Vice-President for Cohesion and ReformsMaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (Slovakia) - Commissioner for Trade and Economic Security; Interinstitutional Relations and TransparencyValdis Dombrovskis (Latvia) - Commissioner for Economy and Productivity; Implementation and SimplificationDubravka Å uica (Croatia) - Commissioner for MediterraneanOlivÃ©r VÃ¡rhelyi (Hungary) - Commissioner for Health and Animal WelfareWopke Hoekstra (the Netherlands) - Commissioner for Climate, Net Zero and Clean GrowthAndrius Kubilius (Lithuania) - Commissioner for Defence and SpaceMarta Kos (Slovenia) - Commissioner for EnlargementJozef SÃ­kela (Czech Republic) - Commissioner for International PartnershipsCostas Kadis (Cyprus) - Commissioner for Fisheries and OceansMaria LuÃ­s Albuquerque (Portugal) - Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments UnionHadja Lahbib (Belgium) - Commissioner for Preparedness and Crisis Management; EqualityMagnus Brunner (Austria) - Commissioner for Internal Affairs and MigrationJessika Roswall (Sweden) - Commissioner for Environment, Water Resilience and a Competitive Circular EconomyPiotr Serafin (Poland) - Commissioner for Budget, Anti-Fraud and Public AdministrationDan JÃ¸rgensen (Denmark) - Commissioner for Energy and HousingEkaterina Zaharieva (Bulgaria) - Commissioner for Startups, Research and InnovationMichael McGrath (Ireland) - Commissioner for Democracy, Justice, and the Rule of LawApostolos Tzitzikostas (Greece) - Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and TourismChristophe Hansen (Luxembourg) - Commissioner for Agriculture and FoodGlenn Micallef (Malta) - Commissioner for Intergenerational Fairness, Youth, Culture and SportMember Statesâ€™ reactions to the nominations:AUSTRIA: According to a press release, Magnus Brunner, a candidate for Commissioner for Internal Affairs and Migration said: â€œIt is an honour for me to have been given the portfolio for internal security and migration in the EU Commission by President Ursula Von der Leyen. This area is central to the future and functioning of the European Union.â€ Austria has taken a clear position on internal security in Europe and is successfully combating illegal migration. â€œWe face major challenges, but also opportunities to strengthen Europeâ€™s values and security.â€BELGIUM: Belgiumâ€™s Hadja Lahbib got the Preparedness and Crisis Management portfolio. Lahbib, who entered into politics only two years ago and immediately became Minister of Foreign Affairs, will be responsible for leading the European efforts on crisis management and humanitarian aid. Lahbib will also be responsible for equality policy. â€œHer portfolio reflects her political career,â€ von der Leyen said.The most heard reaction in Belgium is that Lahbib will not be able to exert much political influence with the competences she was handed. And that is because the country waited until the very last minute to nominate Lahbib als Commissioner designate. â€œProcrastination and haggling have unfortunately saddled Belgium with a weak portfolio,â€ Green MEP Sara Matthieu reacted. â€œIt is high time for Belgian politicians to start appreciating the post of European Commissioner better.â€BULGARIA: Ekaterina Zaharieva, designated for the position of Commissioner for Startups, Research and Innovation, said her portfolio is incredibly important. She expressed gratitude to von der Leyen and to the Bulgarian Government for the confidence she was entrusted with and added that she is aware of the scope of her responsibility. She said: â€œThe portfolio that Bulgaria received is one of the portfolios of the future. It is extremely important and at the heart of the current and the next Commission.â€CZECH REPUBLIC: Czech MEPs in Strasbourg were expressing both satisfaction and disappointment after Ursula von der Leyen announced that she intends to entrust the Czech representative Jozef Sikela with international partnership and development aid issues in the new European Commission.While politicians in the government camp are talking about the strongest portfolio ever held by a Czech commissioner, it is not only opposition lawmakers who consider energy or trade to be stronger portfolios, which have been suggested. â€œNo Czech commissioner has ever had such a strong portfolio,â€ said Tomas Zdechovsky, member of the European Peopleâ€™s Party (EPP), assessing von der Leyenâ€™s decision. Communist MEP Katerina Konecna described the portfolio as a slap in the face for Czechia. â€œMr Sikela will just do the dirty work for Brussels again, which is what our government is used to,â€ she said.PORTUGAL: â€œWe emphasise the crucial portfolio assigned to Commissioner Maria LuÃ­s Albuquerque, nominated by Portugal,â€ Prime Minister LuÃ­s Montenegro wrote in a statement. Maria LuÃ­s Albuquerque will take up the post of the Commissioner for Financial Services and the Savings and Investments Union. â€œThis is essential for progress, for the sustainability of Europeâ€™s social and economic project, and for the Unionâ€™s ability to meet the expectations, needs and interests of European and Portuguese citizens.â€SLOVENIA: Slovenia has been assigned the enlargement portfolio by the new European Commission, one that it has always had an interest in. â€œThe enlargement portfolio is proof that Slovenia is valued and respected in the international community,â€ said Prime Minister Robert Golob immediately after the announcement of von der Leyenâ€™s decision, describing it as a historic achievement. â€œSlovenia is taking on a responsible task.â€â€œMarta Kos is entrusted with the key to ensuring stability and peace in our immediate neighbourhood and beyond, and how to contribute to stabilising both the Western Balkans and the Eastern neighbourhood through the European idea,â€ he said. Foreign Minister Tanja Fajon also welcomed the allocation of the portfolio to Slovenia.SPAIN: The Spanish government reacted with great enthusiasm to Teresa Riberaâ€™s nomination for the Executive Vice-President for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition. â€œIt is a huge success for Spain. It is the most important portfolio that a Spaniard has ever had in the European Commission,â€ government sources told Spanish press agency EFE, who consider that Von der Leyen gives the Spanish socialist the â€œmost relevantâ€ one and â€œentrusts her with the key policies for the structural transformation that she has set as an objectiveâ€, based on the reports prepared by the former Italian prime ministers Enrico Letta and Mario Draghi.SWEDEN: The information that Swedenâ€™s Jessika Roswall will be in charge of environment, water resilience and circular economy came as a surprise, since the Swedish rightwing government rather has been aiming for something to do with productivity or competitiveness. Green and leftist opposition parties are wondering how Roswall will act to support for instance the nature restoration law that the Swedish government fiercely and actively tried to stop. â€œI hope that she will take her new role seriously and work for Europe as a whole, even though it might mean working against the Swedish government,â€ says Greenâ€™s MEP Alice Bah Kuhnke.This article is published twice a week.

"German police crack down on human trafficking in country’s south-east
","German police are investigating a group of suspected human traffickers at a time of growing pressure from illegal immigration in the European Union.
Karlsruhe, Germany (dpa) – German Federal police have searched properties in south-western Germany in a crackdown on people smuggling.A police spokesman told the German press agency dpa on Tuesday that four arrest warrants had already been executed and a total of 24 apartments in the city of Mannheim and nearby Karlsruhe and Worms were searched.A group of seven people alleged to be human traffickers are being investigated.A police spokesman told dpa that the group is alleged to have brought people from the Middle East and the Caucasus to Germany and, at least in some cases, helped them to work in the EU country without residence permits.Police have been conducting investigations in the alleged operation since January on suspicion of people smuggling, employing migrants without residence permits and fraud.The arrest of the people smugglers in Germany is part of a broader effort within the European Union to address the challenges of illegal migration in the 27-member bloc.Germany has recently re-introduced border controls with its direct neighbours to combat irregular migration. The so-called Schengen area of free movement only allows this under exceptional circumstances, such as a serious threat to public policy or internal security.The Schengen area includes most EU member states except Ireland and Cyprus. Bulgaria and Romania are only partially included with the elimination of air and maritime internal border controls. (24 September).",1
EU chief reaffirms support for Ukraine amid energy supply fears ahead of winter,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen embarked on her eighth trip to Kyiv since Russiaâ€™s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ahead of winter, she presented a proposal for the EUâ€™s share of a G7 loan, as well as fresh money for the countryâ€™s energy security.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made her first trip to Kyiv after being re-elected to the post last week. She guaranteed European support for Ukraine ahead of winter, including a proposal for a 35-billion-Euro loan as well as additional financial support for the countryâ€™s ailing energy infrastructure and supply.â€œMy eighth visit to Kyiv comes at a crucial time. Heating season starts in two weeks and Russiaâ€™s relentless attacks on Ukraineâ€™s civilian energy infrastructure aim to inflict maximum damage. We will help Ukraine in its brave efforts to overcome this,â€ the EU executive leader told European media on the ground, including the Portuguese news agency Lusa acting as a pool reporter on behalf of the European Newsroom (enr).The Commission chief announced the plans for Brussels to lend Ukraine 35 billion Euro backed by revenues of frozen Russian assets and promised to help Ukraine â€œkeep warmâ€.The announcement comes after leaders of the G7 – a group of major Western industrialised nations including France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States as well as the EU as a â€œnon-enumerated memberâ€ – had agreed last June on a 50-billion-Dollar loan to support the Ukrainian army and economy in the face of Russian aggression.The International Energy Agency (IEA) has said Kyiv faces its â€œsternest testâ€ so far ahead of the third winter of war with Russia, with Moscow expected to launch another bombing campaign on the countryâ€™s already damaged infrastructure.The EU is to provide an additional 160 million Euro to Ukraine to help repair the damaged energy infrastructure, expand renewable energy, and finance shelters, von der Leyen said ahead of her trip.EU steps in to help fix Ukraineâ€™s crumbling power gridAn IEA report said that in 2022 and 2023 about â€œhalf of Ukraineâ€™s power generation capacity was either occupied by Russian forces, destroyed or damaged, and approximately half of the large network substations were damaged by missiles and dronesâ€.â€œThe European Union is here to help you in this challenge to keep the lights on, to keep your people warm, as winter is just around the corner, and to keep your economy going, as you fight for your survival,â€ von der Leyen said.The EUâ€™s 160-million-Euro support aims to repair infrastructure damaged by Russian bombing and restore – by this winter – 2.5 of the 10 gigawatts Ukraine has lost since March in successive Russian attacks. â€œThat is approximately 15 percent of your countryâ€™s needs for this winter,â€ von der Leyen said.Another pillar of the plan is to increase EU electricity exports to Ukraine until they reach two gigawatts when temperatures have dropped. â€œThis covers approximately twelve percent of Ukraineâ€™s needs for the winter,â€ she said.According to Ukrainian information, 1.7 gigawatts can currently be imported from the EU and Ukraineâ€™s south-western neighbour Moldova. The Ukrainian government had previously stated an increase to over 2.2 gigawatts as a target.â€œWith our two pillars, repair and connect, we cover over 25 percent of Ukraineâ€™s needs for the winter,â€ von der Leyen said.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen visits the State Emergency Service of Ukraine (SESU) in Kyiv on September 20, 2024. Photo: Christoph Soeder/dpa/European NewsroomThe energy aid package will also be dedicated to helping Ukraine decentralise its electricity generation system – and therefore make it less vulnerable to Russian missiles and drones – with the transfer of mobile gas turbines and solar panels.Individual EU member states have repeatedly stressed their support for Ukraineâ€™s energy sector. At a G7 foreign ministersâ€™ meeting in New York focused on support for Ukraineâ€™s energy sector on Monday, Bulgarian caretaker Foreign Minister Ivan Kondov recalled details of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyyâ€™s visit to Bulgaria in July 2023. Back then, a Memorandum of Understanding on cooperation in the field of energy was signed between the Energy Ministries of Bulgaria and Ukraine and two joint working groups for natural gas and nuclear energy were created. EU moves ahead with plan for G7 loan shareThe EU and its member states have so far supported Ukraine with almost 120 billion Euro in grants and loans, according to the Commission. The money has been used to support Ukraineâ€™s war effort, its economy and for humanitarian assistance.Speaking about the proposed 35-billion-Euro loan at a joint press conference with Zelenskyy on Friday, von der Leyen said she was confident that the EU â€œcan deliver this loan to Ukraine very quickly, a loan that is backed by the windfall profits from immobilised Russian assetsâ€.When asked if the European Union is moving forward because it fears other partners like the United States will lag behind, Ursula von der Leyen emphasised that the EU is doing â€œits partâ€.â€œI am absolutely confident that the others will also do their part. For us, it was and is important that we are quick because the urgency is clear and this step now gives us the possibility to finalise the procedures,â€ she added.Von der Leyen made it clear that Kyiv will be able to spend the money as it wants, including on weapons. Zelenskyy said it is crucial that Ukraine can use the funds to support its armed forces and that these funds must not be blocked, â€œbecause this would have an impact on our ability to support our military at the frontâ€.The Commissionâ€™s plan still has to be approved by the European Parliament and a majority of EU countries. In the past, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor OrbÃ¡n, who maintains good relations with Russia, has repeatedly hindered the blocâ€™s efforts to support Ukraine.Ukraine has also lobbied its allies to allow it to use donated weapons to strike â€œlegitimateâ€ military targets deep in Russian territory. The United States and Britain have been discussing allowing it to do just that – but EU states remain divided over the issue.Last Thursday, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on EU countries to allow Kyiv to use Western weapons to strike military targets inside Russia.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Monday insisted that he will not loosen the rules for the use of German weapons in Ukraineâ€™s defensive fight against Russia, despite the pleas from Kyiv. Scholz, who is in the United States to attend the UN General Assembly in New York, specified that this included restrictions that prevent Ukraine from firing missiles deep into Russian territory.Zelenskyy is visiting the United States this week to present his proposals on how to end more than two and a half years of fighting to US President Joe Biden, as well as the two main candidates running to replace him – Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump.Zelenskyy has said he aims to host another international peace summit outlining his vision to end the war in November, to which Russia will be invited.This article is published twice a week.

EU countries take first step to weaken protected status of wolves,"EU member states have moved to weaken wolf protection measures in response to growing concerns about the threat to livestock. At a meeting of EU ambassadors, Germany backed the proposal.Brussels (dpa) – Safeguards to protect wolves in the European Union could be weakened in future after the blocâ€™s member states agreed on the first steps towards easing these measures on Wednesday.Weakening the protection of wolves aims to facilitate the culling of those deemed a threat to livestock. Until now, wolves have been highly protected in Europe. In some regions, however, people question whether the status quo is still justified as the number of wolves is growing.The wolf's comeback in Europe is highly controversial.Currently, wolves receive strict protection status under EU law with provisions allowing for local authorities to take action, including shooting wolves in case of conflicts with rural communities and farmers.While some EU countries, including Germany and France, are in favour of easier cullings, nature conservation groups campaign for different approaches, like better herd surveillance, night confinement and more guard dogs.The wolf's protection in the EU is tied to the 1979 Bern Convention, the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.EU ambassadors in Brussels agreed to propose a change to the body in charge of the wildlife protection treaty, EU diplomats told the German press agency dpa.Amending the Bern Convention is a first step which could pave the way for the European Commission to propose EU legislation to change the protected status of the wolf at a later stage.Having been extinct in large parts of Europe until the 1960s, there are currently around 19,000 wolves in the EU, according to conservationists.

Germany pushes for EU crackdown on Chinese firms Temu and Shein,"According to Germany and five other EU member states, goods sold by Chinese online companies such as Temu and Shein and imported into the European Union do not comply with the Digital Services Act.Brussels (dpa) – Germany is pushing for an EU crackdown on Chinese goods sold online and imported to the European Union that don't comply with the bloc's internal market rules.""These parcels are a direct threat to European industrial producers as well as law-abiding trading companies,"" German Deputy Economy Minister Sven Giegold said on Thursday in Brussels.EU industry and competitiveness ministers are in the Belgian capital to debate the bloc's economic performance and ability to compete with international trade rivals like the United States and China.Giegold said that EU member states Germany, France, Poland, Austria, Denmark and the Netherlands are calling on the European Commission to use all powers under the Digital Services Act (DSA) to investigate.The DSA is a set of powerful EU laws governing online e-commerce companies such as Chinese online retailers Temu and Shein.Â ""Every day, hundreds of parcels come mainly from China with goods which do not correspond with EU market rules,"" Giegold said. He noted that ""a significant share of these products"" do not comply with intellectual property rules, data protection regulations and environmental standards, citing testing data.""A common market which takes itself seriously has to make sure that the products sold on that market correspond to the laws we set democratically in Europe,"" he added.

"Tough stances on migration, new border checks: Schengen, are you OK?","With Germany ramping up border controls earlier this month and other EU countries contemplating stricter migration rules, the Schengen zone of free movement â€“ and no internalÂ border checks â€“ seems to be crumbling.Â In mid-September, Germany expanded border controls to the frontiers with all its nine neighbours in hopes of curbing the flow of irregular migrants, addressing threats from Islamist terrorist groups and cross-border criminal organisations. The move has sparked protests from other EU members.Germany lies at the heart of Europe and of the visa-free Schengen zone, which is designed to allow the free movement of people and goods, long a core idea of the European project.After deadly knife attacks in the German cities of Mannheim and Solingen causing outrage and horror, long-standing debates over how to handle migrants seeking asylum in Germany have intensified in recent weeks.The suspected attacker in Solingen, a Syrian citizen, had evaded an order to be deported from Germany to Bulgaria, where he first entered the EU.Poland, Austria and Greece have been among countries to complain about the introduction of border checks, which are set to last an initial six months. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk condemned the move as â€œunacceptableâ€ and his Greek counterpart Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in an interview with Talk Radio that an â€œunilateral abolition of Schengenâ€ was not the answer.The Czech Interior Minister Vit RakuÅ¡an said that he does not expect any change at the Czech-German border.Border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland were already in place before and have been expanded to the borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.With national elections looming in Germany next year, the attacks in the country put intense political pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholzâ€™s government to toughen its stance on migrants and asylum seekers.But this is not exclusive to Germany: The success of far-right parties in elections in key European countries is prompting even centrist and left-wing governments to tighten policies on migration, creating cracks in European unity and sparking concern among activists.Experts: Border checks wonâ€™t curb illegal migration The UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi told the German daily Stuttgarter Zeitung there were â€œalternatives to restrictive measuresâ€ such as turning migrants back at the border. â€œA fixation on border controls will not deter the truly desperate,â€ Grandi said. â€œThe reintroduction of temporary internal border controls in the Schengen area is almost the automatic consequence of the lack of a common understanding of who is allowed to enter and for what purposeâ€, Jean-Louis De Brouwer, director for European affairs at the Egmont Royal Institute for International Relations in Brussels, told Romanian news agency AGERPRES. In his opinion, the reintroduction of internal border controls in Schengen would, in one way or another, â€œbe detrimental to the internal marketâ€. He believes that very soon – it could be at the next European Council – the member states will have to answer a very difficult question: whether they want to keep Schengen or not.Migration researcher Gerald Knaus does not expect the extension of border controls to all German land borders to lead to a noticeable decrease in the number of asylum seekers. â€œAnyone who expects border controls to lead to a reduction in irregular migration is creating an expectation that is unrealisable,â€ he said on Deutschlandfunk radio.Border controls were also not a means of preventing Islamist terrorism, for example, as many of the perpetrators became radicalised in Germany, the researcher further said. What is Schengen and whoâ€™s part of it? The border-free Schengen area allows free movement for more than 425 million EU citizens and non-EU citizens who legally live, work, travel or study in the European Union.Named after a small village in Luxembourg, the Schengen zone started as an intergovernmental project with five countries in 1985: Luxembourg, Germany, France, Belgium and Netherlands.In waves, the Schengen zone grew and now incorporates most EU countries – except Cyprus and Ireland – as well as non-EU states Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein. Today, it is the biggest zone of free movement in the world.Â According to the Council of the European Union, 3.5 million people cross internal borders every day.  Even though Germanyâ€™s decision has sparked controversy, itâ€™s not the only Schengen member having border checks in place. Austria, Denmark, France, Italy, Norway, Slovenia, Sweden also have temporary measures in place. The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) ruled in 2022 that a Member State can only extend temporary border controls if it is faced with a new threat affecting its public policy or its internal security that is different from the threat initially identified.  Burgas (31 March 2024): The first flight after Bulgaria's accession to the Schengen area by air is welcomed at Burgas Airport. Passengers arriving today from Schengen member states pass through the airport terminals without passport control. Pictured: the first passenger from Krakow, Poland (left) and Burgas Airport Director Georgi Chipilski (right).Phohto: Ð¥Ñ€Ð¸ÑÑ‚Ð¾ Ð¡Ñ‚ÐµÑ„Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²/BÐ¢Ð Bulgaria and Romania: Half in, half out? As of March 31, 2024, Bulgaria and Romania have partially joined the Schengen area. Controls for internal sea and air travel have been lifted while controls at land borders remain. EU officials expect a decision on full Schengen membership until the end of the year. In December last year, Austria was the only EU country that did not support a complete abolition of border checks at the Bulgarian and Romanian Schengen borders. Countries such as Spain and Slovakia are in favour of Bulgaria and Romania becoming full members of the Schengen zone. â€œI am very pleased that in 2024 internal air and sea controls between Bulgaria and Romania and the other Schengen countries will become a thing of the past, after twelve years of negotiations,â€ said Spanish Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska last year during Spainâ€™s presidency of the Council of the European Union.Visiting Austria, Slovak President Peter Pellegrini stated that the Schengen accession of the two countries is â€œimportantâ€ for investments and also for the effective protection of the EUâ€™s external borders.The Head of the European Commission Representation to Bulgaria, Yordanka Chobanova said, on Tuesday in Sofia a decision about Bulgariaâ€™s and Romaniaâ€™s entry into the Schengen area by land is expected by the end of this year. In July, a report by the Institute of Economic Research with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences showed that the direct losses for Bulgaria from the delay of full accession to Schengen amounted to over 400 million Euro.Schengen and Migration: Austriaâ€™s veto and its new migration portfolioAustria will no longer be able to use the migration problem as a pretext to block Bulgaria and Romania from Schengen, Romanian MEP Siegfried MureÅŸan, who is a Vice-President of the European People's Party (EPP), said in a BTA interview in Strasbourg last week. â€œAustria has been given the portfolio of Commissioner for Migration and Home Affairs, so it has the tool it needs to solve migration problems. The solution to this problem will depend on their own commissioner,â€ MureÅŸan said. Austriaâ€™s EU commissioner-designate is Finance Minister Magnus Brunner who is a member of the Austrian Peopleâ€™s Party (Ã–VP). The Ã–VP belongs to the EPP, a centre-right group in the European Parliament.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyenâ€™s decision to give the migration portfolio to Brunner has stirred some controversy in Brussels as he has little experience on the subject.Taking Austriaâ€™s opposition of the Romanian and Bulgarian Schengen accession and the fact that the migration and internal affairs portfolio has been assigned to an Austrian into account, a Commission spokesperson said that Commissioners do not represent their Member State of origin, but work to contribute to the EU project, in the interest of all European citizens.The President of the European Movement Austria (EBÃ–), Christoph Leitl, said: â€œThis is an opportunity for Austria, namely to turn criticism into participation!â€The new European Commissioners are yet to pass their â€œgrillingâ€ by the European Parliament before the new Commission can be finally confirmed. Historically, not all candidates pass which means their countries need to nominate a new person.This article is published twice a week.

Report: 'Noticeable' climate gap in EU countries' agricultural plans,"A new report investigating the EU member statesâ€™ agricultural plans found that the plans are not sufficiently protecting the environment. The European Court of Auditors highlighted that the European Commission's move to pacify farmers risked impacting the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).Â Luxembourg (dpa) – Agricultural plans drawn up by EU countries to access the bloc's massive subsidies are not climate friendly enough and do not adequately protect the environment, top policy auditors warned on Monday.The ""green design"" of the European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is better, said Nikolaos Milionis, the lead auditor of the investigation said in a statement. ""However, compared with the past, we havenâ€™t seen substantial differences in the member statesâ€™ agricultural plans,â€ he added.Totalling 378.5 billion Euro, CAP is worth nearly a third of the EU budget and is meant to support farmers' incomes and safeguard the bloc's food supplies.CAP is also meant to protect the environment with funding conditions. The agricultural subsidies policy gives EU member states different options to meet the bloc's environmental and climate change objectives.https://twitter.com/EUauditors/status/1841047905307926868ECA: EU countries use exemptions to conditionsHowever, investigators from the European Court of Auditors (ECA) found that all EU countries used ""exemptions to agricultural and environmental conditions.""The ECA also found that some EU countries ""reduced or delayed the application of the green measures that are required for obtaining EU money.""""There is a noticeable gap between the EUâ€™s environmental and climate targets and the agricultural plans drawn up by EU countries,"" the ECA said.After massive EU farmer protests against bureaucracy and falling incomes, the European Commission responded by further relaxing certain requirements such as those related to crop rotation to access subsidies.The ECA highlighted that this move to pacify farmers risks impacting CAP's environmental objectives further. Also lacking were measures to monitor carbon emission reductions.Milionis said that ""the EUâ€™s ambitions for the climate and the environment are not matched at national level.""While EU countries complied with CAP requirements to set aside a minimum amount of funds for ""environmental and climate measures,"" auditors concluded that CAP plans are ""not substantially greener.""
